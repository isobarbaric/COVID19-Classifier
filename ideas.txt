to-do:
- remove functionality of creating a news_channels folder

extra stuff:
- visit good, bad websites in JSON and get text for article (start with title and then go for article)
- removing non-printable characters from the string (not working the best rn)
- more validation for articles titles
- many sites don't get a legitimate attempt (like jstor)
- different word tokenizer -> remove punctuation and single letters (http://text-processing.com/demo/tokenize/)
