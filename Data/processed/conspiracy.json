        "text": "Answer:\n\nBefore we get into specifics, let's start with a quick overview of the types of tests for coronavirus.\n\n\n\nTypes of COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nThere are basically two types of tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19:\n\n\n\nVirus test\n\nThis test detects the virus (SARS-CoV-2) to help determine if you have a current infection. Although you can be infectious before showing any symptoms, the virus is best detected during the first week of symptoms (which is about two weeks after becoming infected from exposure) (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nThere are two type of virus tests: the PCR and antigen test. Early in the pandemic, both tests had to be performed in a laboratory or clinic with special rapid, portable machines, but rapid, home-based PCR and antigen tests have become available. There are also at-home sampling kits by which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report PCR results back to you.\n\n\n\nVirus tests are typically done by collecting a sample of mucous from a nose swab (typically from the nasopharynx or nostril) or saliva or oral swabs. There is some evidence that virus detection may be better with samples from saliva or the mouth or throat (Blythe, medRxiv 2021 \u2014 preprint; Wyllie, Correspondence in JAMA, 2020), but most tests (and all antigen tests) authorized for use in the U.S. rely on samples from the nose and the FDA has advised against using antigen tests designed for the nose to be used in the mouth. Nevertheless, a study in the Netherlands, showed that an antigen test (BD Veritor) was able to detect about 20% more positive cases using samples collected first from the throat (around the tonsils) and then from the nose than with samples just from the nose. The combined samples were also used on Roche's SD Biosensor (aka COVI9-19 At-Home Test) antigen test which was even more accurate than BD Veritor (Zwart, medRxiv 2022 -- preprint). (Interestingly, one antigen test in the UK utilizes a swab of the throat (tonsils) that is then used to swab one nostril.) An apparent benefit of sampling from the throat is that the virus appears at higher levels there about a day earlier than in the nose, although levels then rise higher in the nose and remain higher there for a longer period, as shown in a study of people in the UK given COVID-19 by being infected with virus in their nose (Killingly, In Review 2022 -- preprint). Using only a swab from the inside of the check, however, was shown to identify only 2 positive cases out of 22 that were positive with nostril swabs in a small study that used the Abbott BinaxNow antigen test (Schrom, medRxiv 2022 \u2014 preprint).\n\n\n\nThe PCR test uses a technique that amplifies genetic material (RNA) from the virus. This can take as little as a few minutes or several hours. The FDA has authorized at-home sampling kits with which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report the results back to you. It has also authorized at-home PCR tests that take about 20 to 60 minutes. Home PCR tests are more expensive than home antigen tests but may detect infections earlier than antigen tests. (Sign in to see our reviews of home PCR tests from Cue, Detect, and Lucira, and to see our Top Pick among these.)\n\n\n\nAn analysis of tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that the proportion of samples testing positive on PCR tests were twice as high at 2 pm than in the morning, decreasing later in the afternoon and evening. Researchers proposed this may indicate that test accuracy varies by time of day and could have public health implications (McNaughton, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nUpdate: In addition to the many commercial PCR tests that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the CDC has been producing its own, FDA-authorized, PCR test. More recently, the CDC developed a newer test that can simultaneously test for and distinguish between COVID, influenza A and influenza B, and, as of January 1, 2022, it will withdraw the older test. Sign in to find out why.\n\n\n\nThe antigen test identifies a protein (or \"antigen\") that is specifically found on the virus. Advantages of the antigen test are that it can provide results in as little as 15 minutes and can be produced at lower cost, lending itself to wider use in screening. In addition, only a nasal swab is needed from the nostrils, not a much deeper, nasopharyngeal swab. The downside with antigen tests is that they are more likely to provide a false negative result than a gene amplification test; that is, it's more likely to identify your sample as negative when you are actually positive. Consequently, negative results from an antigen test should be repeated within three days, but at least 36 hours later (or confirmed with a PCR test) for people who are at high-risk of infection \u2014 but a positive antigen result is highly likely to be accurate. False negatives may also occur with emerging viral variants, if the variants have significant mutations of the target antigen. However, most popular antigen tests in the U.S. target nucleocapsid antigen, which is still present in variants such as Delta and Omicron. Be aware of a common mistake made when reading rapid home antigen tests and that one of the chemicals in these tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\n\n\nSign in for details about benefits and limitations of rapid antigen testing for the Omicron variant and find out how likely are you to still be contagious if you test positive on a rapid antigen test after a 5-day isolation.\n\n\n\nBe aware that one of the chemicals home antigen tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\nSeveral home antigen tests have been authorized by the FDA and are available, such as Abbott BinaxNow Self Test, BD Veritor, CLINITEST, Flowflex, iHealth, InteliSwab, On/Go (AccessBio CareStart), Roche At-Home, and Quidel QuickVue. However, there important differences in the accuracy of these tests, their shelf-lives and stability in freezing temperatures, and their cost. Also, versions of some of these tests have been recalled. [Sign in for our comparison of antigen tests and our Top Picks.]\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody test\n\nThis test detects antibodies to the virus and requires blood \u2014 either a drop or a vial \u2014 to determine if you have been infected in the past and have developed some level of immunity. This test (also called a serology test) can be run in a laboratory or on a test strip, although even test strips must be used in an authorized facility, not at home.\n\n\n\nAs it takes time to develop antibodies that can be detected, antibody tests are most accurate when performed at least 20 days after the first disease symptoms and may be most accurate (in terms of not missing antibodies that are present) 4 months or longer after a positive virus test. This was shown in study of 486 COVID patients in California in which the likelihood of a positive antibody (IgG) test result increased with time after a positive virus test. Antibody tests were most accurate (~80%) among those ages 40 to 59 years and least accurate (~65%) among those 70+ or under 40. The tests were more accurate for men than women (79% vs 72%) (Vashisht, JAMA Netw Open 2021).\n\n\n\nTests focus on levels of the antibody IgG, which persists without much decline for several weeks, but may include levels of IgM which fall off more rapidly (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). These tests look for antibodies to specific parts of the virus, namely its spike proteins (proteins on the outside of the virus that can bind to receptors on human cells) or nucleocapsid proteins (proteins inside the virus). An advantage to testing for antibodies to the nucleocapsid is that these antibodies can be easier to detect, however, antibodies to the spike proteins are believed to be more important in conferring immunity against the virus, as these antibodies may block viral entry into cells \u2014 although antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins may still serve as proxies for immunity. See Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test to learn which marketed tests target each protein.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not recommended that antibody tests be relied upon to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, be aware that only tests that focus on antibodies to spike protein would be useful for this purpose because the authorized vaccines generate antibodies only to spike proteins. A negative result on a nucleocapsid antibody test provides no information about the effectiveness of a vaccine although it would suggest that a person has not had COVD-19. The list of authorized antibody tests below indicates whether a test focuses on spike, nucleocapsid, or both types of proteins.\n\n\n\nIf, at some point, tests for spike protein antibodies are indicated for assessing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, those that provide a quantitative or semi-quantitative measurement, will be more useful than those that provide only a yes/no answer. Sign in for more information about antibody tests that focus on the spike protein and are semi-quantitative, including one that is available from a major U.S. laboratory.\n\n\n\nNote: Avoid taking large doses \u2014 10,000 mcg or more \u2014 of biotin (a B vitamin) for several days before an antibody test, as biotin may skew results.\n\nSign in to learn which tests may be affected by biotin.\n\nAnother way our bodies fight the virus is with T cells. Preliminary research suggests that even if antibody levels are too low to be detected, people previously infected with the virus may produce enough T cell response to provide immunity (Sekine, MediRxiv 2020). However, currently authorized tests do not measure this type of immunity, and one should still apply distancing and health precautions regardless of test results.\n\n\n\nSome labs may provide you with an index value that reflects the strength of the antibody signal produced from your test. Higher antibody levels generate higher signals and higher index values. The interpretation of these index values depends on the test used. For example, for a particular test the cut-offs could be \"less than 1.01\" for negative, \"1.01 to less than 1.21\" for indeterminate, and \"greater than or equal to 1.21\" for positive (Theel, J Clin Microbio 2020). Or, there could just be a single cut-off index value of, say, 1.40 for positive, with anything below being negative (Example: Abbott Alinity -- https://www.fda.gov/media/137910/download). If you would like to know your index value, be sure to check that the lab you use provides the value.\n\n\n\nWho is checking these tests?\n\nTo speed the availability of tests, rather than put these through its normal approval process, the FDA has provided a special emergency use allowance (EUA) for tests that, although imperfect, may be useful at this time. So there are actually no FDA \"approved\" SARS-CoV-2 virus tests, but a list of \"FDA authorized\" tests. The FDA allowances are based on data submitted by the test manufacturers, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government laboratories are now conducting independent tests of these tests and the FDA has been making the results public (see results in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section and watch for further announcements in our newsletter.)\n\n\n\nSeveral other organizations around the world have been testing the test and/or certifying virus and antibody tests. The European Union's has been certifying tests, conferring on them its CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark, and the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has been doing the same. Researchers in California, Denmark, and elsewhere have been testing the antibody tests.\n\n\n\nBe aware that in June 2020 the FDA warned consumers about at-home antibody tests being sold without FDA clearance or approval and issued warning letters to three companies selling these tests. Some of these tests were falsely labeled as FDA approved. [Update (August 19, 2020): The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that CLIA- certified laboratories are no longer required to notify the FDA, nor request its authorization, for tests they develop in-house. It is not clear what information about such tests will be maintained or published. This change could allow for novel tests to become available more quickly but eliminates oversight by the FDA, creating more of a buyer-beware situation. Labs may, voluntarily, still choose to apply to the FDA, and the FDA will continue to publish information about tests submitted this way. If in doubt, ask your doctor or lab if the test you are considering is authorized for use by the FDA. (Links to the FDA information are provided in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section.\n\n\n\nWhere to Get COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nVirus Test\n\nTo date, the FDA has permitted the use of over 90 virus tests. The vast majority must be performed on a sample collected in a medical setting, such as in a doctor's office, a diagnostic laboratory, or a drive-through facility, but the FDA has also begun authorizing at-home sample collection tests for the virus.\n\n\n\nLocal testing (often free)\n\nAlthough you can ask your doctor for a virus test, you may be able to arrange to get a virus test for free from your state or local government. You can also go to a diagnostic laboratory or testing center, including some pharmacies. The test may be covered by your insurance or the government based on an assessment of your risk level. Here are some examples of testing programs around the country.\n\nProject Baseline works with community based screening programs in locations in several states to offer free virus testing. You must fill out an online questionnaire and be accepted. You will then be given an appointment at local testing center where a sample will be collected with a self-nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. The project is sponsored by the parent company of Google through its health unit, Verily, and a Google email account is needed to complete questionnaire online.\n\nRite Aid Pharmacies in some locations are participating in Project Baseline, providing testing at no cost to anyone 18+ years of age.\n\nCVS (including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB) had originally offered drive-up, rapid testing using the Abbott ID NOW system, a small, portable device that yields results in 13 minutes or less. Unfortunately, this system was been reported to yield a high percentage of false negative results due to lower sensitivity than other systems. That is, a negative result may need to be confirmed using another test (Basu, bioRxiv 2020 preprint). (For more details, see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test , below). Virus testing is still offered, but specimens are now sent to independent, third-party labs for processing, and test results are available in approximately three to four days.\n\nWalgreens offers drive-up testing in which you perform your own nasal swab. You sample is sent to a laboratory and you are notified by email or phone when results are available. (Originally results were promised within 24 hours).\n\nKroger Health offers public drive-thru and walk-up COVID-19 testing.\n\n\n\nAt-home tests\n\nThe FDA has authorized several fully self-administered virus tests (providing rapid results) or test kits (to be sent into a lab) for use at home. Currently, two of these (Abbott BinaxNOW Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue) can be purchased at pharmacies and take about 15 minutes. Note that these will not provide you with a digital pass for events, airlines, or restaurants. Another version of the BinaxNOW Antigen test (the \"home\" version) provides a digital Navica pass, but this test must be purchased online (at about twice the cost) and many venues may not accept the digital pass.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On October 1, 2021, 200,000 test kits of another COVID-19 home test were recalled due to a manufacturing defect causing false positive results (i.e., indicating that someone has COVID-19 when they do not). For details, including what to do if you've used this home test, sign in to the full answer, which also includes details about four other currently available at-home tests.\n\n\n\nAntibody Test\n\nAs with virus tests, many laboratories have received FDA approval to conduct antibody tests, some of which are very accurate. Although the FDA has not approved or authorized rapid, home tests for antibodies, many such tests are available in other parts of the world and some have been sold in the U.S. The FDA has authorized one rapid antibody test for use at point-of-care settings, i.e., non-laboratory medical settings such as in medical offices and pharmacies.\n\n\n\nThrough a local healthcare provider\n\nYour healthcare provider can arrange for you to get an antibody test if deemed appropriate. Blood would be drawn either by your provider or at nearby diagnostic laboratory. Similarly, many walk-in, urgent care centers can arrange for you to have the test, for a fee, which may be covered by your insurance. The samples are typically sent to a commercial laboratory, so results can take a few days.\n\n\n\nConsumer-initiated testing\n\nBe aware than in many cases, the cost of antibody tests may be covered by insurance if ordered by your physician or health care provider. Some labs will require payment for consumer-initiated tests, while others will bill your insurance. Be sure to check the payment policy of the lab you plan to use if requesting your own test. You can also check if your insurance company covers COVID-19 testing. Medicare often covers the full cost of COVID-19 virus and antibody tests. If you are uninsured, health care providers can submit a claim to have virus and antibody tests covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\n\n\nQuestDirect allows consumers to request a COVID-19 IgG antibody test and pay for it online ($119 plus a $10.30 physician oversight fee). An appointment is made for a blood draw at one of Quest Diagnostics 2,200 patient service centers and test results are available online one to two days later. Interested consumers must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days. Quest has stated that the testing will initially rely on antibody tests run on the Abbott Architect and EUROIMMUN systems.\n\n\n\nLabcorp also allows consumers to request a test directly through its website. According to the website, there is no up-front out-of-pocket cost for consumer initiated tests, but you will be charged a $10 fee for physician oversight services (there is no physician oversight fee if the test order comes directly from your own physician or healthcare provider). Labcorp will \"bill the cost of the COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly to your insurance carrier, or if uninsured, to the appropriate government program.\" Antibody tests offered by Labcorp include Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV02 (IgG), and DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n\nYou can see how each of these tests compare in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section below.\n\n\n\nRapid, home tests\n\nThe FDA has not yet approved or authorized of the use of any rapid, home antibody tests but several have been approved by the European Union, which provides its CE mark (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) and/or by the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA). In addition, research groups have been evaluating these tests. Some of these tests have been marketed in the U.S. without FDA approval or allowance.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best COVID-19 Test\n\n\n\nThere are now more than 90 virus tests (including a recently approved saliva test) and 22 antibody tests for COVID-19 authorized by the FDA. ConsumerLab has reviewed the data on their performance and assessed which appear to be the best antibody tests for COVID-19. We've added this information for ConsumerLab members. Sign in as a member or become a member now to learn how specific brands of virus and antibody tests compare, which currently appear to be the best, where to get them, and whether any of the tests can identify which variant caused an infection.\n\n\n\nWhat Does a Negative Antibody Test Mean?\n\nIf you took a coronavirus antibody test and it came back negative, it can mean one of several things:\n\nThe test was not sensitive enough to detect antibodies that existed. This is more likely if the test had a sensitivity of less than 100% (see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests);\n\nfor sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); You may have never had COVID-19;\n\nYou took the test too early -- generally less than 20 days after first disease symptoms, although, according to the CDC, some people may take longer; or\n\nYou didn't develop levels of antibodies high enough to be detected by tests -- which preliminary research suggests may happen in mild and asymptomatic cases (Long, Nature Med 2020).\n\nThere is currently not enough data to know if a negative result could result from taking the test too late. More research is needed to determine how long significant levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist.\n\n\n\nThe CDC cautions, \"Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\"\n\n\n\nThis article will be updated as new information is obtained."

        "text": "Answer:\n\nN95 masks are the gold standard, but other good options exist if you do not have an N95, primarily KN95 masks and well-made, well-fitting, 3-layer cloth masks. Disposable surgical masks are also readily available but tend to leave gaps between the mask and face, reducing their usefulness (although there are ways to improve it).\n\n\n\nIf you want to find and buy a good mask that meets the guidelines of the U.S. CDC as well as the World Health Organization, go right to Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy.\n\n\n\nIf you want an N95 respirator, see Finding the Best N95 Masks section. If you want a KN95 respirator, see the Finding the Best KN95 Masks section.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your own mask (which can be quite effective) see the Best combination of materials for making a mask section. We also identify what seem to be the best disposable filter materials.\n\n\n\nMasks can be used alone or, for increased protection, particularly for the eyes, with a face shield \u2014 which we have also reviewed.\n\n\n\nHere's what we cover in this answer:\n\nWhy and when you should wear a mask\n\nWhile vaccination to protect against COVID-19 has led to a decreased need for masking in certain situations, unvaccinated individuals are still advised to wear a mask when in public indoor settings. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, masks are recommended for fully vaccinated individuals when in indoor spaces with high community transmission rates, as well as for fully vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems or who are taking immune-suppressing drugs. Masks are also required for all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, when required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws (including local business and workplace guidance), on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. (Get more details about masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in our article about COVID vaccines).\n\n\n\nAlong with social distancing, a mask provides additional protection from infecting others as well as preventing exposure. In addition, according to the CDC, \"cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns.\" A review of studies found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses was 82% lower with physical distancing of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or more, compared with shorter distances, and protection might increase with additional distance. Face mask use could result in an 85% reduction in risk of infection versus no face mask, with stronger associations for N-95 or similar respirators, while surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks were less effective but offered more protection than single-layer masks (Chu, Lancet 2020).\n\n\n\nAs wearing a mask may reduce the amount of virus to which a wearer is exposed, it has been postulated that even if a mask-wearing person becomes infected, the reduced viral load to which they were exposed may mean that they suffer a milder disease. For example, on cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of infected patients (81%) were asymptomatic on a ship that had provided masks to all passengers and staff compared to only 18% of cases being asymptomatic on a cruise ship without masking (Gandhi, J Gen Intern Med 2020; Gandhi, N Engl J Med 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother benefit of wearing a mask is that, due to the heat and moisture of exhaled breath, masks have been shown to increase the humidity and temperature of inhaled air, which, researchers have proposed, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as COVID by promoting the clearance of pathogens in the lungs (Courtney, Biophysical J 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nAlthough previously reserved for healthcare workers to due a shortages in supply, the CDC advised on January 14, 2022 that N95 and KN95 respirators may be worn by the general public, with the exception of surgical N95 respirators, which are standardized for fluid resistance, i.e. blood splatter, and continue to be reserved for use in healthcare settings. In its updated guidance regarding masks and respirators the agency stated, \"While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, properly fitted respirators provide the highest level of protection.\" (See our reviews of N95 and KN95 respirators below.) It also emphasized that use of well-fitted masks and respirators are particularly important in high-risk situations and for people who may be at risk for more severe disease.\n\n\n\n[Note: On January 19, 2022, the U.S. government announced that it will make approximately 400 million N95 respirators available free of charge to the public, possibly as early as the week of January 24th. According to a New York Times article about the announcement, the N95s will be distributed through community centers and retail pharmacies and will be limited to three per person. Details about brands or models were not provided.]\n\n\n\nIf using a cloth or disposable mask, be sure it fully covers the nose and mouth. Clear panel masks are acceptable to facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or who otherwise need to see a speaker's mouth in order to communicate. In addition to fully covering the nose and mouth, masks should also fulfill the following guidelines:\n\nCloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source). (See our Top Picks among cloth masks that meet these requirements. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers.\n\n) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. Masks should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face.\n\nMasks should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.\n\nScarves, ski masks, turtlenecks pulled over the face, masks made from loosely woven material, and masks with slits, exhalation valves, or punctures are not acceptable.\n\n\n\nFace shields and goggles can be worn with masks, but cannot be worn instead of a mask. (See our Top Pick among face shields).\n\n\n\nFailure to wear a mask as described above is a violation of federal law and can be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and state and local authorities. The TSA has proposed a fine of $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders (TSA 2021). However, there are several exceptions to the requirement: Masks may be removed for brief periods of time when eating, drinking, or taking medication, while communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when required to verify one's identity, and when requested by a ticket agent or law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\nAny benefit to wearing masks at home?\n\n\n\nAlthough CDC guidelines do not currently include the use of face masks at home, the rate of transmission from one household family member to another was 79% lower when members wore face masks prior to the first member developing COVID-19 symptoms, according to a study of 124 families in Beijing in which there was at least one infected person. Overall, there was a 23% rate of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected family member to another, but this was no lower when mask wearing began after the first member developed symptoms. These results are consistent with the fact that viral load is highest two days before symptoms and on the first day of symptoms. Daily use of disinfectants reduced transmission by 77%. Transmission rates were four times higher if the primary case had diarrhea and 18 times higher when there was frequent daily close contact (less than 3 feet apart). The researchers recommended use of face masks in families in which a member has been at risk of getting infected. In China, over 70% of transmission occurred within families (Wang, BMJ Global Health 2020).\n\n\n\nBest combination of materials for making a mask\n\nCurrently, both the CDC and WHO provide basic guidelines for choosing a cloth mask.\n\nAccording to CDC guidelines, a cloth mask should:\n\nUse a minimum of 2 - 3 layers, preferably with batting between the layers\n\nUse fabrics with high thread count and fine weave, water-resistant fabric, and hybrid fabrics such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel (cotton blends may be better than pure cotton). (In addition, the CDC notes that, due to their electrostatic charge, materials such as polypropylene may enhance filtration efficacy and fabrics such as silk can help to repel droplets.)\n\nCover the nose and chin\n\nFit snugly on the sides of the face without gaps\n\nBe secured with ties or ear loops\n\nUse ties rather than ear loops because ties provide better fit\n\nIt also advises that if wearing a neck gaiter, choose one with two layers or fold it to make two layers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the CDC warns not to choose masks that are:\n\nMade of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, such as vinyl\n\nHave exhalation valves or vents, as this allows virus particles to escape\n\nReserverd for healthcare workers (i.e. surgical N95s\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) provides more details about which types of fabrics may work best. It recommends using three layers of fabric for non-medical, cloth masks in order to achieve the best combination of filtration efficacy and breathability:\n\n\n\n1. Innermost layer: Hydrophilic material (i.e., one that can absorb moisture, such as cotton or cotton blends)\n\n\n\n2. Middle layer: Hydrophobic material (i.e., repels moisture) of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a second cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets.\n\n\n\n3. Outermost layer: Hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearer's nose and mouth.\n\n\n\n(See Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy for our review of masks for sale that appear to meet the WHO requirements)\n\n\n\nNote that polypropylene, a material often used to make disposable surgical masks, has an electrostatic charge which can improve the filtration efficiency of masks. Polypropylene \"spunbound\" is sold in fabric and many other retail and online stores under brand names such as Oly*fun and Pellon. Polypropylene is sold in different weights (measured in grams per square meter or GSM). Most commercially manufactured surgical masks are made of 3-ply 25GSM. Polypropylene materials between 25 and 40 GSM tend to have similar filtration efficacy and breathability, while polypropylene 60 GSM has a higher filtration efficiency but less breathability (Zhao, Nano Lett 2020). Be aware that some forms of polypropylene should not be machine washed.\n\n\n\nSee below for a more detailed discussion of the filtration efficacy of various cotton and synthetic household fabrics.\n\n\n\nNote that Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) has advised against using face masks labeled as containing graphene (or biomass graphene) due to concerns that graphene particles might be inhaled (Health Canada April 2, 2021). Graphene is promoted for use in some masks as having antibacterial and antiviral properties. Preliminary research suggests that graphene particles may cause early lung toxicity in animals, but the agency noted that the \"potential for people to inhale graphene particles from face masks and the related health risks are not yet known, and may vary based on mask design.\" Health Canada has asked distributors in Canada to stop selling graphene masks while it investigates the safety of using graphene in masks, and advised that people who have used graphene face masks and \"have health concerns, or symptoms such as new or unexplained shortness of breath, discomfort or difficulty breathing,\" to consult with their healthcare provider. For examples of graphene masks sold in the U.S., sign in and read the full answer.\n\n\n\nStandards for masks\n\n\n\nASTM International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), has published voluntary standards for non-medical cloth face masks. Masks labeled \"Meets ASTM F3502\" must be shown, in an accredited laboratory, to meet one of two designations that will also appear on the mask label:\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 20% and airflow resistance of < 15 mm H2O\n\n\n\nLevel 2: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 50% and airflow resistance of < 5 mm HH 2 O\n\n\n\n(For comparison, a NIOSH approved N95 must have an airflow resistance of no more than 35 mm H 2 O).\n\n\n\nMasks that claim to meet ASTM standards are also required to provide user instructions for size proper selection, proper use, and cleaning or disposal instructions.\n\nHow cotton and other household fabrics compare in blocking coronavirusdish cloth (85% polyester and 15% nylon) was slightly better -- 97.9%. In addition, most household fabrics were more breathable than the material in a medical mask. The dish cloth, for example, was twice as breathable as the medical mask (Aydin, medRxiv 2020 --preprint). (See the CDC website to learn how to make a cloth face covering.)\n\n\n\nTightly woven cotton, combined with silk or chiffon\n\nA study at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory found that tightly woven, high-thread count cotton (600 thread-per-inch (TPI) sheet by Wamsutta) was more effective in filtering large droplets (similar to larger-sized SARS-CoV-2 droplets) than loosely woven cotton with a lower thread count (quilters cotton, 80 TPI), while fabrics with an electrostatic charge (such as silk and chiffon) were best for blocking aerosols -- the smaller sized droplets that remain suspended in air for extended amounts of time. Using layers of both fabrics, together, was most effective for blocking both large and small droplets. For example, two layers of 600 TPI cotton fabric had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.5% and 82%, respectively, but one layer of 600 TPI cotton combined with two layers of chiffon (90% polyester, 10% spandex from Jo-Ann Stores) had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.2% and 97% -- which, at low airflow rates (i.e., when not all air is drawn through the mask) is nearly as good as a properly-fitted N95 mask for blocking large particles and better than the N-95 with respect to small particles, of which only 85% are blocked by an N-95 mask). However, as emphasized in a published correction to the study, it is not known how efficient this fabric combination will be at normal or high rates of airflow when made into a fitted mask, i.e., when there are no leaks and all air flows directly through the mask, particularly when one is engaged in high levels of exertion. The researchers also found that small holes or leaks around the edges of the fabrics could decrease the blocking efficacy by 50% or more, and emphasized the importance of a good fit (snug and without gaps) (Konda, ACS Nano 2020). [Note: An illustration in the study shows the electrostatic layer of fabric as the inner layer when fabrics were combined. However, ConsumerLab contacted the author of the study who suggested that electrostatic fabric (such as chiffon) may be best used as the outer layer of the mask to avoid humidity from the nose or mouth, which could interfere with the electrostatic properties, but emphasized that was his suggestion, not something that was tested in the study.]\n\n\n\nCotton bandanas and handkerchiefs\n\nIn another study, researchers at Florida Atlantic University tested masks made from common household fabrics, as well a typical \"cone\" mask (often sold at pharmacies) to see how well they worked to stop droplets using a simulated model of coughing (a mannequin head through which liquid was manually pumped). Without any covering, droplets from the simulated cough traveled an average of 8 feet. With a bandana (single-layer, elastic T-shirt material, 85 threads per inch) droplets traveled an average of 3 ft. 7 inches, with a folded cotton handkerchief (as shown in this instructional video featuring the U.S. Surgeon General), 1 ft. 3 inches, and with a cone mask (CVS Cone Face Mask), 8 inches. The most effective mask was a stitched cotton mask (using two-layers of cotton quilting fabric, 70 threads per inch), with which droplets traveled just 2.5 inches. The researchers noted that \"healthcare professionals trained properly in the use of high-quality fitted masks will not experience leakage to the extent that we have observed in this study. However, leakage remains a likely issue for members of the general public who often rely on loose-fitting homemade masks.\" (Verma, Phys Fluids 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and surgical masks\n\nRather than focus on how far droplets travel, researchers at Duke looked at how well different masks block droplets during speaking. A fitted N95 mask without a valve was most effective in retaining droplets, with less than 1% of droplets being transmitted. The next most effective, in order, were a 3-layer surgical mask, a cotton-polypropylene-cotton \"apron\" mask, a 2-layer polypropylene mask, a 2-layer cotton pleated mask, and then an N95 with a valve.\n\n\n\nNeck gaiters (fleece, microfiber & polyester)\n\nThe Duke researchers found that two masks offered little protection: A double-layer bandana was only slightly more effective than using no face covering at all, while the worst face covering was a \"gaiter\" style neck fleece (often worn during running or sports) that showed a 10% increase in the number of droplets. The researchers suggested that the neck fleece material breaks larger liquid droplets into smaller droplets than can more easily be dispersed into the air (Fischer, Sci Adv 2020 \u2014 includes photos of the masks but no details about origin or brands). However, tests conducted by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute found that, when measuring droplets that dispersed in an outward direction at a distance of about 1 ft. (30 cm), neck gaiters (one made of thin, 100% polyester (Chaos) and the other, a thicker, microfiber gaiter made of 87% polyester and 13% elastane (Cirque)) worked as well as a cloth mask (a no-sew mask made of cotton T-shirt material), blocking 100% of larger droplets (> 20 microns), 90% of droplets 5 microns in size, and 50% of 0.5 micron aerosols. They were somewhat less efficient than the cloth mask at blocking smaller aerosols, although when the thinner gaiter was doubled over, it blocked about 90% of droplets and aerosols (0.5 to 5 microns) (Pan, Virginia Tech PDF 2020).\n\n\n\nWhen doubled over, some neck gaiters may be more effective than a triple layer, all-cotton cloth mask. A study conducted by researchers at the CDC and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), found that a single-layer polyester neck gaiter (FKGIONG Sun UV Protection Neck Gaiter, 95% polyester, 5% Spandex) blocked 47% of outward moving cough aerosols (ranging in size from 0 to 7 microns) and when doubled over, blocked 60%. This was slightly better than a medical procedure mask with ear loops, which blocked 59% and a cloth mask made of 3 layers of cotton fabric and ear loops (Hanes Defender), which blocked 51%. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (Lindsley, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). It should be noted that the cotton cloth mask tested did not have an outer layer made of hydrophobic material (such as polypropylene or polyester) as recommended by WHO. If wearing a neck gaiter, make sure it fits securely and consider choosing one with an adjustable cord, to help prevent it from falling down (off of the nose and mouth) during strong sudden movements, such as during a sneeze.\n\n\n\nWhich masks protect you best?\n\n\n\nA study that evaluated how well masks protect the wearer from breathing in small particles (ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.6 microns) and factored in the fit of the mask as well as its filtration efficiency found that a NIOSH approved N95 (3M 9210) had the highest filtration efficiency at 98%, followed by 80% for a medical procedure mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health) with nylon hosiery placed over it, and 71.5% for a surgical mask with ties. [Note: The filtration efficiency of the medical procedure masks can range dramatically depending on how it was worn.] The filtration efficiency was 74% for a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops (Easy Masks LLC) with an aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert which, interestingly, had a slightly higher filtration efficiency after being washed once, 49.9% for a folded, cotton bandana, 39.3% for a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties (Renfro Corporation), 37.8% for a single-layer woven gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana MPUSA LLC), 28.6% for a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops (Red Devil Inc), and just 26.5% for a 3-layer woven cotton mask (100% cotton) with ear loops (Hanesbrands Inc) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\n\n\nBest Materials for Making Your Own Mask Filter\n\nAs discussed above, the WHO recommends that the middle layer of a cloth mask be made of a synthetic, nonwoven fabric such as polypropylene, or a second layer of cotton (high thread count cotton has been shown to have better filtration efficacy than lower-thread cotton). Many cloth masks that you can buy online come with a \"filter pocket\" as the middle layer, which you can buy pre-made filters for, or add your own. We've reviewed common materials for making mask filters, including Filti Face Mask Material and Medline Dry Baby Wipes, as well as materials such as polypropylene and other non woven fabrics (100% polypropylene, Pellon Sew-In Interfacing and Oly*fun), cotton and quilter's cotton. Sign in as a member or join now to see our reviews and more details about materials for making your own mask filters.\n\n\n\nHow Cloth, N95, KN95 and other Masks Compare\n\nAs noted above, well-constructed cloth masks may reduce your risk of exposure to virus-containing particles, but their main purpose is to help protect others from potentially infectious particles that you may emit. They generally do not provide the same level of protection to the wearer as N95 or KN95 respirators. The extent to which cloth masks can filter particles (filtration efficiency) can vary widely depending on the type of fabrics used, the number of layers, and the fit. Cloth masks are also not held to the same standards as N95 and KN95 respirators, as they do not have to be tested by a government agency or meet standardized criteria in order to be sold. If you choose a cloth mask, be sure to it meets basic CDC and WHO guidelines. You can also look for cloth masks that has been tested and shown to meet voluntary ASTM standards. A cloth mask that has received a \"Level 2\" designation has been shown to have a particulate filtration efficiency \"of at least 50%.\"\n\n\n\nIn comparison, NIOSH approved particulate N95 respirators have been tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the U.S. CDC. They must meet certain minimum criteria, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, an inhalation resistance of < 25 mm H20 and an exhalation resistance of <35 mm H20 (these are measures of how difficult is to breath in and out while wearing the respirator). Unlike cloth masks, NIOSH approved N95s are also required to attach to the head with head straps, rather than ear loops, as head straps can provide a more secure fit and reduce gapping.\n\n\n\nKN95 respirators, the Chinese \"equivalent\" of N95 respirators, must meet similar standards, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, and limits for inhalation and exhalation resistance. They are not required to have head straps (most have ear loops), although some do. Be aware that, during the pandemic, there have been many reports of counterfeit KN95s sold in the U.S., so you need to be careful where you buy KN95s.\n\n\n\n(For more about the differences between N95s and KN95s and quality concerns, see Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s?).\n\n\n\nSign in to see CL's Reviews of Popular N95 Respirators.\n\nBest Cloth Masks You Can Buy\n\nIf you prefer to purchase a cloth mask, we reviewed many masks sold online and identified several that we believe best meet WHO guidelines and/or are constructed with materials that offer a good combination of filtration efficacy and breathability. We also considered features that can affect fit and comfort, such as adjustable/bendable nose wires and adjustable straps, which can be particularly important for people who wear glasses or hearing aids. We also reviewed oversized masks designed to accommodate beards or to be used when singing, and masks with clear panels to enable lip reading by others.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we assessed eyeglass fogging with each mask when worn in cool air.\n\n\n\nOur list starts with our overall Top Pick for quality, comfort and breathability, fit, and minimal eyeglass fogging. This is followed by our next favorites, as well as masks for those who need clear panels. In our review of masks, we considered those from Allet, Atelier, Giftington, Graf Lanzt, LA Linen, Proper Cloth, Rafi Nova, Stark's, Tom Bihn, Vertex, Vida, Vistaprint, and masks sold on Etsy.\n\n\n\nBe aware that there is a shipping fee for most masks, calculated before check out based on location and/or other factors. Most companies provide an estimated time for the product to ship, but delivery time will depend on the shipping option you choose. ConsumerLab.com derives no revenue from sales of these products.\n\n\n\n(To see our list of the best cloth masks you can buy, sign in. If you are not a ConsumerLab member, join now.)\n\nHow to reduce air leakage around a mask\n\nAir leakage around a mask reduces the level of protection it provides you and those around you. There are several ways to reduce air leakage, as discussed below. Also be aware that if you are infectious, the area of your face beyond a leak, including eyeglasses, may become contaminated due to exhaled droplets, as demonstrated in OSHA study (Stephenson, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nKnotting ear loops\n\nThe fit and filtration efficiency of medical procedure masks with ear loops can be significantly improved by knotting the ear loops and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (see illustration), according to research conducted on manikins by the CDC. This was shown to reduce exposure to aerosols from a cough by 64.5%.\n\nDouble masking\n\nWearing a medical mask (i.e., a blue \"procedure\" mask) under a cloth mask improves protection, (likely by minimizing leaks between the medical mask and skin), but wearing a medical mask over a cloth mask has less benefit. A study found that wearing a medical mask under a cloth mask increased the filtration efficiency of cloth masks (which, alone, were 41 to 44% efficient), as well as medical masks (which, alone, were 43 to 62% efficient). Adding a medical mask beneath a cloth mask increased fitted filtration efficiencies to 66% for a simple cotton ear-loop mask, 77% for a cotton bandana, and 81% for a gaiter. Doubling a medical mask was not as effective, nor was doubling cloth masks \u2014 which also reduced breathability (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2021).\n\nNose wires\n\nBe aware that, while adding a nose wire to masks can improve their fit (and therefore, possibly reduce air leakage and improve protection). They seem to be of benefit with stiffer masks but; but not with masks made with stretchy or more flexible material (O'Kelly, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\nTry not to bend over while wearing a mask\n\nResearchers at Columbia University who were fit testing N95 respirators found that normal breathing and talking did not negatively affect mask fit, and turning the head from side to side slightly improved fit (perhaps due to tightening). However, moving the head up and down slightly worsened fit, and bending over decreased proper fit by as much as 50%. The researchers suggested kneeling rather than bending over when wearing a mask (Chen, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nMask fitters\n\nMasks fitters are a \"frame\" that can be placed over masks to improve the fit and \"seal\" of the mask against the face to reduce air leakage and increase inhalation filtration efficiency. Using mannequins that could \"breathe,\" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that placing either of two marketed mask fitters over a variety of masks increased inhalation filtration efficiencies from just 7% without the fitter to 26% for a 4-ply cotton mask, from 52% to 63% for a 3-ply spunbond polypropylene mask, from 44% to 91% for a surgical mask, and from only 18% up to as much as 95% for a 3-ply disposable non-medical mask with a melt-blown polypropylene center. Sign in to learn make a mask fitter at home or buy either of the two used in the study.\n\n\n\nNylon stockings\n\nAnother way to reduce air leaks was suggested by a study at Northeastern University in Boston, which showed that pulling an 8 to 10-inch tube of nylon (cut from a queen-sized nylon stocking) down over a regular mask and to the top of the neck. This significantly prevented air leakage around the mask and improved particle filtration efficiency, making the combined masking nearly as effective as an N-95 respirator which, unlike a medical mask, has an electrostatic charge and is specifically designed to prevent air leakage (Mueller, medRxiv 2020 --preprint; Godoy, NPR.org 4/22/20).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a study found that adding a sleeve of nylon hosiery over a medical procedural mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health Inc) increased its overall filtration efficiency from just 38.5% to 80%. Other techniques that created a better fit for the procedure mask to reduce air leakage included tying the ear loops and tucking in the side pleats (see video demonstration), which increased filtration efficiency to 60.3%, or securing the ear loops with ear guards (61.7%), a hair clip (64.8%) or placing three rubber bands across the front of the mask and looped on the ears (78.2%) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\nHow to reduce eyeglass fogging from masks\n\nOur tests indicated that eyeglasses were less likely to fog in cool air with masks that 1) came up higher on the nose and cheeks (allowing glasses to sit over the edge of the mask 2) had a bendable top frame that could be contoured for a close fit around the nose and cheeks, 3) had adjustable ear or head bands, allowing the mask to be tight against the face, and 4) had an outer layer of 100% polyester or chiffon rather than a cotton or cotton/polyester blend. Find out which masks had the least fogging.\n\n\n\nLens fogging may also be minimized by rinsing lenses with highly diluted liquid soap and then air drying (stand lenses up so excess drips off) (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). This leaves a surfactant film that reduces surface tension and causes water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer, reducing fogging (Margrain, Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2011). Anti-fogging sprays and wipes are also sold, but be sure to follow directions and allow liquids to dry before wearing to avoid eye irritation or injury from the liquid. (A CL member reported severe eye irritation after using JAWS Spit Gel which seems to have gotten into his eye after a COVID nasal test that caused eye tearing) (Peng, Cornea 2006). Eye injury has also been reported in healthcare workers in China who used anti-fog spray on medical goggles (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020).\n\n\n\nSingle-sided and double-sided tape strips can also be used to seal the edges of masks around the eyes and nose to reduce fogging. ConsumerLab purchased two tape strip products sold on Amazon, MaskTite Adhesive Strips and Cabeau Tape. We tried each with the masks in this review, and with a disposable mask, while wearing glasses. [Sign in to see our reviews of these tapes and our mask reviews.]\n\nHow to clean a cloth mask\n\nThe CDC advises that cloth masks be washed daily (and after high exposure) with soap and water. The agency also suggests each person have at least two cloth masks, likely so that one can be used while the other is being cleaned. It notes that \"cloth can be used for an extended period as long as they are not wet or soiled, but do not reuse them unless washed and cleaned.\" Masks should not be worn while still wet, as the agency states that the filtration effectiveness may be reduced. The FDA recommends choosing a cloth mask that can be washed and machine dried without damage or change in shape.\n\n\n\nCloth masks can be washed in a washing machine. They can also be cleaned using heat, but a washing machine is preferred. Silk and chiffon fabrics may need to be hand washed with cold water.\n\n\n\nIf you've purchased a mask, check with the fabric manufacturer or see the care instructions on the label. If hand washing is required, be sure to use adequate soap/detergent and rinse thoroughly, as soap helps to break down the lipid layer that allows SARS-Cov-2 to attach to surfaces. Some sturdier silk and chiffon blends, such as poly-spandex-chiffon, can be machine washed with warm water and tumbled dry if placed in a mesh bag for delicates.\n\n\n\nRe-using N95s?\n\nCurrently, the CDC recommends re-using a single N95 respirator no more than five times. It also advises healthcare workers \"wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs,\" noting that this \"will provide some time for pathogens on it to \"die off\" during storage.\"\n\n\n\nA study of 3M N95 respirators (dome-shaped duckbill models) worn by healthcare workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital caring for COVID-19 patients found that all N95s worn less than 12 times (and stored between uses) passed seal check and fit testing. Even when used about 40 times, 83% still passed these tests. The study implied that the masks had not been subject to decontamination procedures but they may have been somewhat protected from pathogen contamination as they were typically worn with face shields (Fabre, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nPreventing mask-related skin irritation and acne\n\nKeeping masks clean can also help prevent skin irritation, acne, and other skin conditions that can be caused by or exacerbated by wearing a mask, including eczema (contact dermatitis), rosacea, and folliculitis (inflammation/infection of hair follicles). Although the term \"maskne\" has become a common term to describe skin irritation and eruptions after wearing masks, contact dermatitis appears to be the most common skin irritation associated with wearing masks. All of these conditions can be aggravated by humidity within the mask, increased bacterial load on the skin, and friction from mask material. In addition to replacing and/or cleaning masks regularly, dermatologists recommend applying light moisturizer 30 minutes before putting on your mask and maintaining good oral hygiene to help minimize the risk of skin irritation. You can find more information and the full list of tips for skin care when wearing masks in this article (see \"General measures to prevent PPE related facial dermatoses\") (Rud, BMJ 2021).\n\nEffect on breathing function and potential carbon dioxide buildup\n\nWhen wearing an N95 respirator or a well-fitted mask with high blocking efficiency there can be some carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask over time (Sinkule, Ann Occup Hyg 2013). According to researchers at Stanford University, N95 masks are \"are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That's significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\" However, a small study in the U.S. found that wearing an N-95 mask for up to one hour did not cause any significant adverse effects in healthy healthcare workers performing moderate activities, despite significantly decreased inhaled oxygen and increased inhaled carbon dioxide levels (Roberge, Respir Care 2010). A representative from the CDC told Reuters.com that \"...the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia [elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide].\"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, surgical masks (also known as medical masks), which are inherently not as well-fitting as N95 respirators, do not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency, as noted by the World Health Organization. Several studies have demonstrated this. For example, a study among 20 healthy adults showed that moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill) for one hour while wearing a surgical mask led to only slight, clinically non-significant changes in CO2 levels (as measured on the skin) compared to exercise without a mask (Respir Physiol Neurobiol 2012). Even during vigorous exercise (cycling to exhaustion, an average of about 10 minutes) a study among 14 healthy men and women showed that wearing a disposable surgical mask or a three-layer cloth mask (Washable 3D Face Mask, TriMax Sports Inc. \u2014 made with bamboo charcoal cloth, non-woven fabric, and Lycra) had no effect on blood or muscle oxygenation or exercise performance compared exercising without a mask (Shaw, Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020).\n\n\n\nFurthermore, a study of 10 healthcare workers (including individuals with controlled asthma and four smokers), found that wearing a surgical mask (AFLUID, made of three layers of polypropylene and one layer of liquid resistant polyethylene) continuously for four hours did not reduce breathing function (Ciocan, Med Lav 2020). Additionally, older adults who wore a three-layer disposable nonmedical face mask with ear loops (Boomcare DY95 model, Deyce Leather Co Ltd) for one hour showed no decline in self-reported blood oxygen levels (as measured by pulse oximeter) (Chan, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother study showed that, even among older adults (average age 71) with breathing difficulty due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wearing a surgical mask during a six-minute walk test did not result in any major changes in CO2 retention (Samannan, Ann Am Thorac Soc 2020). The researchers suggested that discomfort while wearing a surgical mask might be caused by the increased warmth of facial skin and inhaled air inside the mask, which may trigger sensations of anxiety or claustrophobia in some people.\n\n\n\nThe CDC advises that face masks should not be placed on children under the age of two, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who would not be able to remove the mask without assistance.\n\nInhalation of microplastics and OPEs\n\nConcern has been raised about the risk of inhaling microplastic particles when wearing a mask made of polypropylene or other materials containing plastics. A study in China found that most masks increased the inhalation of fiber-like microplastics but notably decreased the risk of inhalation of spherical particles. While some evidence has suggested that fiber-like microplastics may be more toxic to animals than spherical microplastics (Ziajahromi, Environ Sci Technol 2017), the investigators concluded that, overall, inhalation of microplastics from masks is a small problem compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19 without a mask, as people already regularly inhale high amounts of microplastics from the air, with or without a face mask.\n\n\n\nThe study found that only N95 respirators reduced the risk of inhaling fiber-like microplastic particles compared to not wearing a mask, while a nonwoven mask, a fashion mask, and a cotton mask increased it by 17%, 41%, and 54%, respectively, surgical masks increased it by about 4% to 73%, and activated charcoal mask increased it by 117%. Inhalation of spherical microplastic particles was reduced by about 47% to 96% for all masks compared to not wearing a mask.\n\n\n\nDisinfecting any of the masks with UV irradiation, alcohol, air blower treatment, washing with soap and water, or exposure to sunlight increased the microplastic inhalation risk compared to untreated masks, although the risk was only small following washing with water and was lowest following exposure to sunlight. Alcohol disinfection increased the risk of microplastic inhalation most significantly (Li J Hazard Mater 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and other plastic materials used to make KN95 respirators, medical, surgical and other types of masks are often treated with organophosphate esters (OPEs) which, at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure to OPEs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact have been linked with cancer and other adverse effects. Sign in to the full answer to see what researchers found when they looked at the risk of inhaling OPEs when wearing masks.\n\nAre KN95 respirators as good as N95s?\n\nN95 and KN95 masks (or, more technically, respirators) are designed to protect you, as well as others around you. Both are supposed to filter 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns. However, as discussed below, this isn't always the case with widely sold KN95 masks (which are designed to meet Chinese, rather than U.S. specifications). In addition, while N95 respirators attach with head bands to help ensure the best fit, most KN95s attach with ear loops, which may cause a loose or improper fit, and allow for air leakage. A study of N95 and KN95 respirators have shown that mask performance depends, in part, on the tightness of the contact between the material and the facial skin and masks that tied around the head outperform those with elastic ear loops (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2020). As discussed above, how you move while wearing a mask may also affect fit.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, due to the previous shortage of N95 masks, in April 2020 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provided guidance that KN95 masks certified to China's GB2636 standards of 2006 or 2019 (imprinted on masks as \"GB2626-2006\" or \"GB2626-2019\") \"will provide greater protection than surgical masks (i.e., facemasks, other than surgical N95s[3]), homemade masks, or improvised mouth and nose covers, such as bandanas and scarves.\" Caution: You should not buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it.\n\n\n\nTests of KN95s from China by the CDC show that the filtration efficacy of some KN95 masks is 95% or higher but can be as low as 5.3%. Furthermore, tests by ECRI, an independent, U.S. based non-profit organization that evaluates equipment for hospitals and healthcare systems, showed that 5 of 11 KN95s did not meet the filtration efficiency standard of 95%. ECRI also found large variations in filtration efficiencies of KN95s within the same lot from a single manufacturer, suggesting quality control issues. (You can download ECRI's test results, which includes manufacturer information and photos of the respirators tested by clicking on \"PPE Testing Report\" on this page on ECRI's site).\n\n\n\nBuying a KN95\n\nStarting in 2020, the FDA published and maintained a list of N-95 and KN95 respirators from China given emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA during the pandemic. However, as of July 6, 2021, due to the increased supply and availability of NIOSH-approved respirators, the FDA has revoked its authorization of non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China for healthcare workers. Respirators with previous EUA status may still be marketed to the general public, but must be labeled as face masks, rather than respirators.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On August 25, 2021, the FDA announced that federal approval of respirators made by particular manufacturer has been revoked due to concerns about the quality of the products. Sign in for the details.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best KN95 Mask\n\nN95 masks are currently very hard to find and purchase as they remain reserved for healthcare and frontline workers. In contrast, KN95 masks are widely available for purchase on websites such as Amazon. However, it can be very difficult to know if a KN95 mask is genuine and effective. We reviewed many KN95 masks sold on Amazon but found only one currently on the FDA's list of authorized respirators that we recommend, and we found two that should be avoided. We also found an FDA-authorized KN95 through an online direct distributor in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe CDC publishes a list and images of dozens of counterfeit and falsely marketed respirators. Signs of a counterfeit respirator include no approval number or NIOSH markings, decorative fabrics or add-ons, and claims of being approved for children.\n\n\n\nOther respirators\n\n\n\nBefore N95 respirators became more available, the United States Department of Labor, noted that healthcare workers who were unable to obtain N95 respirators could use R95, R99, P95, P99, P100 and others respirators. Like N95 masks, these are expected to filter out a minimum of 95% of particles of the most penetrating size, and those ending in a \"99\" or \"100\" filter out at least 99% or 99.97%, respectively, of such particles but can be more difficult to breathe through. R95 and P95 masks are typically used for protection when working with oil-based substances like fuel, paints, solvents, or pesticides. N95s are not resistant to oil, R95s are \"somewhat resistant\" and P95s are \"strongly resistant to oil or oil proof,\" as shown in the CDC's infographic about these types of masks. If considering an alternative respirator, make sure it is NIOSH approved. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when trying to protect others. (See a video demonstration by researchers at Florida Atlantic University of how aerosols can spread when coughing while wearing an N95 mask with a valve).\n\n\n\nKF94 respirators from Korea are often promoted as the Korean \"equivalent\" to N95 respirators, but this is not quite accurate. Although they can have relatively high filtration efficacy, KF94 masks are considered \"public use\" respirators and are not held to the same performance standards as Korea's Special 1st class \"occupational use\" respirators (which are considered to be roughly equivalent to NIOSH approved N95 masks). KF94 respirators are designed to have a filtration efficacy of 94%, and CDC tests of one brand of KF94 found its filtration efficacy to be even higher (99.85 to 99.94%). However, unlike all NIOSH-approved N95s (which attach with head bands), KF94 respirators attach with ear loops, which, the CDC points out, may compromise their fit and efficacy. The CDC did not perform fit testing on the KF94s it tested and noted a lack of information about manufacturing quality control. In addition, unlike surgical N95 respirators, KF94 respirators are not considered fluid resistant (Kim, J Korean Med Sci 2020).\n\n\n\nElectrical air purifying respirators that mimic powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are available on Amazon, ranging in price from about $60 to $100, but these devices would not be suitable for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. These devices include a portable high efficiency (HE) filter that can be connected to a face mask via a flexible hose/air duct to supply fresh air to the wearer. By ventilating air from the HE filter to the mask, these devices should create positive air pressure. This means that air exhaled by the wearer would leak out of the mask. Consequently, these devices might protect the wearer if the ventilation is strong enough, but they would not protect individuals nearby the wearer.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, unlike NIOSH-certified PAPRs, which are rated as being more effective than N-95 masks, available electrical air purifying respirators do not appear to be certified. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices even help protect the wearer. In addition, similar to other personal (\"wearable\") air purifiers, these devices might not be permitted on airplanes, as security officers can confiscate these devices if they feel they are unsafe or cause a threat.\n\n\n\nAre copper masks better?\n\n\n\nCopper has been shown to inactivate a wide variety of bacteria and some viruses, typically within minutes to hours of contact, and a study found that SARS-CoV-2 (at about 72\u00b0F and 40% relative humidity) was undetectable on copper after four hours (van Dormalen, NEJM (correspondence) 2020). There do not appear to be studies showing how effective masks made with copper or copper infused fabric are against SARS-Cov-2. However, preliminary research with other viruses suggests a possible benefit. A study funded by the maker of copper masks (Cupron) for healthcare and institutional use, showed that an N95 mask with two added layers of copper oxide infused material (polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight/weight copper particles) had a similar filtering efficacy as a regular N95 mask, but was much more effective in inactivating human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) (Barkow, PLoS One 2010). A University of Massachusetts Amherst microbiologist developed a reusable mask made of 99.95% pure copper mesh, which, according to a university news release, was shown to \"kill 90% of microbes within five minutes of contact.\" In Hong Kong, the government is distributing fabric masks to the public that contain copper, known as the CuMask+ (Parry, BMJ 2020). According to the manufacturer, CuMask+ is made up six layers, \"two of which are specially made with small quantities of copper.\" Tests published by the company suggest it retains antiviral activity with up to 60 washes (handwashed with soap and cold water). If you use a copper-containing mask, be sure to clean it regularly and according to the product instructions: Bacteria and viruses can cling to dirt or other particles on copper, making it less effective (Grass, Appl Environ Microbiol 2011).\n\n\n\nSome concerns have been raised about the safety of copper masks and the possibility of breathing in copper particles. While we don't have safety information for specific products, laboratory studies that measured the amount of copper released from copper oxide impregnated masks during 5 hours under simulated breathing conditions was far below the respiratory copper permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by the USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") (Borkow, Curr Chem Biol 2012).\n\n\n\nHow to protect yourself from COVID-19 in a car\n\n\n\nPreliminary research suggests that viral loads can quickly build up within a closed car, even during rides as brief as 15 minutes. Wearing a mask, as well as a face shield, are good first steps to help protect yourself and others. When there are two people in a car (one driver and one passenger) seating the passenger in the back seat on the opposite side of the driver creates the most distance between them. To increase ventilation, computer modeling research shows that riding with all windows down is most effective. Since this isn't always practical, the next most effective way to increase ventilation is by opening one window in the back and one in the front, opposite of where the occupants sit, creating airflow across the interior of the car. Keeping all the windows closed and running the air-conditioning, is least effective (Mathai, Sci Adv 2020). Keep in mind that none of these steps eliminate the risk of infection.\n\n\n\nHow to improve safety for bus passengers and drivers\n\n\n\nA study of aerosol flow on a school bus and transit bus that were driven under real-world conditions showed that mask wearing and ventilation can significantly reduce exposure to aerosols for passengers (Edwards, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Based on their experiments, the researchers recommended the following tips to help reduce exposure to aerosols for bus passengers:\n\nRequire all passengers and drivers to wear masks on buses. Even a cloth mask that's 50% efficient can reduce particles released from a cough by 50% and reduce their dispersal by several feet.\n\nOpen windows partially or fully. This can reduce airborne particles by 50% to 80%.\n\nConsider seating arrangements that only allow for same household or same cohort passengers to sit together.\n\nSocial distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses, but any extra distance allows the air movement to reduce exposure to infectious particles.\n\nFor bus drivers, the researchers recommended risk could be reduced by using a dashboard fan to create airflow in the driver seat area. They also noted that, when safe to do so, opening all transit bus doors at every stop would allow for better air exchange.\n\n\n\nWhat masks protect against wildfire smoke?\n\n\n\nCloth masks, including those with sewn-in or removable filters, should not be relied on for protection from wildfire smoke, according to the CDC. They protect against some of the larger particles in wildfire smoke, but not from smaller particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. In addition, one-strap paper dust masks and surgical masks, worn alone, are not recommended for wildfire smoke protection.\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that people who have to be outdoors in wildfire affected areas wear fit-tested, NIOSH-approved N95 or P100 respirators, and the CDC notes that properly fitted N95 respirators can \"provide protection from wildfire smoke and from COVID-19 for the individuals wearing them.\" To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others, N95 masks without valves are recommended. If an N95 mask with a valve is your only option for wildfire smoke protection, consider covering the valve with tape or wearing a surgical mask over the N95 when around others, as recommended by John Balms, M.D. at UCSF. According to the CDC, KN95 respirators can also provide protection from wildfire smoke, and advises looking for a KN95 that meets requirements similar to those set by the CDC's NIOSH (see our Top Pick among KN95 masks, which was tested by the CDC)."

        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nAs of June 2022, the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been divided into five distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.1 Most circulating omicron variants belong to sublineage BA.2; however, the prevalence of BA.2.12.1 (a subvariant of BA.2), BA.4, and BA.5 is increasing rapidly in several regions of the world.2 Previous studies have shown that the BA.2 subvariants have sensitivities to some monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that are lower than those of the ancestral strains and other SARS-CoV-2 variants.3-5\n\nAs compared with BA.2, the BA.2.12.1 subvariant has substitutions L452Q and S704L in its spike protein, and both BA.4 and BA.5 have additional changes. Substitutions L452Q, L452R, and F486V are in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, the major target for monoclonal antibody therapies, which is worrisome with respect to the effectiveness of current monoclonal antibodies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against these variants. The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against the BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 subvariants that have been isolated from patients is unknown.\n\nIn this study, we examined the neutralizing ability of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, individually and in combination, against omicron BA.2.12.1 (hCoV-19/USA/NY-MSHSP-PV56475/2022), BA.4 (hCoV-19/USA/MD/HP30386/2022), and BA.5 (hCoV-19/Japan/TY41-702/2022) isolates. We confirmed that the BA.5 isolate had five additional amino acid changes (69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493) in its spike protein as compared with a BA.2 isolate (hCoV-19/Japan/UT-NCD1288-2 N/2022) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The BA.2.12.1 isolate consisted of a mixed viral population encoding either R or W at position 682, in addition to having L452Q and S704L substitutions. The BA.4 isolate contained a V3G mutation in the signal peptide region of the spike protein, in addition to the other five changes (i.e., 69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493).\n\nTable 1. Table 1. Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antiviral Drugs against Omicron Subvariants in Vitro.\n\nLive-virus focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT) showed that monoclonal antibody REGN10933 (marketed as casirivimab) lost neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 (Table 1 and Fig. S2). However, REGN10987 (marketed as imdevimab) retained neutralizing activity against these isolates. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab also inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; however, the value of this combination was higher (indicating reduced neutralizing activity) on 50% focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT 50 ) by a factor of 131.6 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 133.5 against BA.4, and by a factor of 317.8 against BA.5 than against the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo) used in our study. COV2-2196 (marketed as tixagevimab) had neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1 (although its FRNT 50 value for this virus was higher by a factor of 54.7 than against the ancestral strain) but not against BA.4 or BA.5. However, COV2-2130 (marketed as cilgavimab) neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. The combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, with a low FRNT 50 value (38.1 ng per milliliter, 37.8 ng per milliliter, and 192.5 ng per milliliter, respectively). However, as compared with the FRNT 50 value against the ancestral strain, the FRNT 50 value of this combination was higher by a factor of 6.1 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 6.0 against BA.4, and by a factor of 30.7 against BA.5. The precursor of sotrovimab (S309) lost inhibitory capability against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. Of the FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that we tested, only LYCoV1404 (marketed as bebtelovimab) efficiently neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; the FRNT 50 values for these isolates were similar to those for the ancestral strain.\n\nRemdesivir and molnupiravir (inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2) and nirmatrelvir (an inhibitor of the main protease) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We therefore tested these antiviral drugs by determining the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of each compound against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. As compared with the amino acid sequence of the reference strain Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, all three isolates encoded the P314L mutation in their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the P3395H mutation in their main protease (Fig. S3). The susceptibilities of BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 to the three compounds (with higher values indicating reduced susceptibility) were similar to those of the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo). For the BA.2.12.1 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.3 with remdesivir, was higher by a factor of 1.1 with molnupiravir, and was lower by a factor of 0.7 with nirmatrelvir; for the BA.4 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.7 with remdesivir and was higher by factors of 1.2 and 1.1 with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir, respectively; and for the BA.5 subvariant, the IC 50 was higher by factors of 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6 with remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S4).\n\nThe main limitation of our study is the lack of clinical data on the efficacy of these monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients infected with BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5 subvariants. Overall, our data suggest that the three small-molecule antiviral drugs remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir may have therapeutic value against the sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants. Our data also indicate that bebtelovimab is effective against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. However, in clinical use, these variants may be less susceptible to combination therapy with casirivimab and imdevimab and with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. In addition, sotrovimab may not provide effective treatment against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5. Our findings show that the selection of monoclonal antibodies to treat patients who are infected with omicron variants should be carefully considered.\n\nEmi Takashita, Ph.D.\n\nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSeiya Yamayoshi, D.V.M., Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nViviana Simon, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nHarm van Bakel, Ph.D.\n\nEmilia M.

The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against the BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 subvariants that have been isolated from patients is unknown.\n\nIn this study, we examined the neutralizing ability of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, individually and in combination, against omicron BA.2.12.1 (hCoV-19/USA/NY-MSHSP-PV56475/2022), BA.4 (hCoV-19/USA/MD/HP30386/2022), and BA.5 (hCoV-19/Japan/TY41-702/2022) isolates. We confirmed that the BA.5 isolate had five additional amino acid changes (69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493) in its spike protein as compared with a BA.2 isolate (hCoV-19/Japan/UT-NCD1288-2 N/2022) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The BA.2.12.1 isolate consisted of a mixed viral population encoding either R or W at position 682, in addition to having L452Q and S704L substitutions. The BA.4 isolate contained a V3G mutation in the signal peptide region of the spike protein, in addition to the other five changes (i.e., 69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493).\n\nTable 1. Table 1. Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antiviral Drugs against Omicron Subvariants in Vitro.\n\nLive-virus focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT) showed that monoclonal antibody REGN10933 (marketed as casirivimab) lost neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 (Table 1 and Fig. S2). However, REGN10987 (marketed as imdevimab) retained neutralizing activity against these isolates. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab also inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; however, the value of this combination was higher (indicating reduced neutralizing activity) on 50% focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT 50 ) by a factor of 131.6 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 133.5 against BA.4, and by a factor of 317.8 against BA.5 than against the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo) used in our study. COV2-2196 (marketed as tixagevimab) had neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1 (although its FRNT 50 value for this virus was higher by a factor of 54.7 than against the ancestral strain) but not against BA.4 or BA.5. However, COV2-2130 (marketed as cilgavimab) neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. The combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, with a low FRNT 50 value (38.1 ng per milliliter, 37.8 ng per milliliter, and 192.5 ng per milliliter, respectively). However, as compared with the FRNT 50 value against the ancestral strain, the FRNT 50 value of this combination was higher by a factor of 6.1 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 6.0 against BA.4, and by a factor of 30.7 against BA.5. The precursor of sotrovimab (S309) lost inhibitory capability against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. Of the FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that we tested, only LYCoV1404 (marketed as bebtelovimab) efficiently neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; the FRNT 50 values for these isolates were similar to those for the ancestral strain.\n\nRemdesivir and molnupiravir (inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2) and nirmatrelvir (an inhibitor of the main protease) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We therefore tested these antiviral drugs by determining the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of each compound against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. As compared with the amino acid sequence of the reference strain Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, all three isolates encoded the P314L mutation in their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the P3395H mutation in their main protease (Fig. S3). The susceptibilities of BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 to the three compounds (with higher values indicating reduced susceptibility) were similar to those of the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo). For the BA.2.12.1 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.3 with remdesivir, was higher by a factor of 1.1 with molnupiravir, and was lower by a factor of 0.7 with nirmatrelvir; for the BA.4 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.7 with remdesivir and was higher by factors of 1.2 and 1.1 with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir, respectively; and for the BA.5 subvariant, the IC 50 was higher by factors of 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6 with remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S4).\n\nThe main limitation of our study is the lack of clinical data on the efficacy of these monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients infected with BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5 subvariants. Overall, our data suggest that the three small-molecule antiviral drugs remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir may have therapeutic value against the sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants. Our data also indicate that bebtelovimab is effective against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. However, in clinical use, these variants may be less susceptible to combination therapy with casirivimab and imdevimab and with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. In addition, sotrovimab may not provide effective treatment against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5. Our findings show that the selection of monoclonal antibodies to treat patients who are infected with omicron variants should be carefully considered.\n\nEmi Takashita, Ph.D.\n\nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSeiya Yamayoshi, D.V.M., Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nViviana Simon, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nHarm van Bakel, Ph.D.\n\nEmilia M.

        "text": "To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences.\n\nThe panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research.\n\n\n\nDownload the full report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists.\n\nThe physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point.\n\nIf we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous.\n\nThe physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.\n\nPandemic's Impact on the Physical Sciences Enterprise Panel Members\n\nChair\n\nJulia Phillips, Sandia National Laboratories (Retired)\n\nMembers\n\nSusan Avery, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Retired)\n\nJonathan Bagger, TRIUMF\n\nPhil Bucksbaum, Stanford University\n\nFrance C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation (Retired)\n\nEric Isaacs, Carnegie Institution\n\nVictor McCrary, University of the District of Columbia\n\nRobie Samanta Roy, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nCarl Wieman, Stanford University\n\nAIP Staff Liaisons\n\nMichael H.

        "text": "P\n\nresident Biden\u2019s bout with COVID-19 is illustrative of the debate currently raging about \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d \u2014 the recurrence of symptoms and of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after a seemingly successful five-day treatment course of Paxlovid. This phenomenon is not unusual, and it suggests that regulators should modify the terms of the drug\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nWhen he headed the Food & Drug Administration, Dr. Frank Young used to admonish his minions that sometimes regulations need to be tempered with common sense. Regulators would do well to apply that advice as the agency ponders whether additional steps are necessary to guide Paxlovid users.\n\nPaxlovid is a true breakthrough drug with efficacy of over 90% in treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and preventing hospitalization and death. It is an oral two-drug combination regimen \u2014 one drug is nirmatrelvir, an antiviral, while the second, ritonavir, inhibits the metabolism of the nirmatrelvir, thereby maintaining therapeutic levels.\n\nBut as with the president and a small number of other cases, physicians sometimes see an unexpected phenomenon \u2014 an improvement of symptoms, only to have them (and test positivity) return within days after completion of the five-day course. It\u2019s known as the Paxlovid Rebound.\n\nThere are not much data on how frequently this occurs, but a recent article in Clinical Infectious Diseases reported an incidence of 0.8%. Whatever the frequency, there are several possible mechanisms to explain such a phenomenon. The likeliest is that the Paxlovid dose is too low or the length of treatment too short to prevent the rebound, because the drug knocks down the amount of virus present so rapidly that the immune system doesn\u2019t have sufficient time to eradicate it, and the virus begins to replicate again.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nA pertinent question, then, is how long does it take for the immune system to clear SARS-CoV-2 from an infected patient? Ironically, the best answer to this question comes from the TOGETHER randomized controlled trial that examined the effect of ivermectin vs. placebo on multiple parameters of COVID-19, one of which was the number of days it took to clear the virus. (TOGETHER is a private-sector funded international collaboration to identify existing medications that can be re-purposed to prevent or treat COVID-19)\n\nIn the trial, only a quarter of the trial participants were able to clear the virus within seven days with no treatment, so that the time to achieve complete viral clearance for most patients must be considerably longer, perhaps two or three weeks, maybe more. How long, then, does it take for patients treated with Paxlovid to clear the virus?\n\nAlthough this precise information is not available from Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials (which were performed pre-Omicron), the company does provide this information:\n\nAn approximate 10-fold decrease in viral load at Day 5, relative to placebo, was observed in both EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR [trials], indicating robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 and representing the strongest viral load reduction reported to date for a COVID-19 oral antiviral agent.\n\nThis offers a solid clue about what\u2019s happening. While a five-day course of Paxlovid is sufficient to keep about 90% of Covid victims out of the hospital and reduce their viral load 10-fold, there appears to be a subpopulation of people who either didn\u2019t respond as well as others to Paxlovid or, perhaps, had a higher viral load to begin with.\n\nThat is consistent with the findings of researchers at the University of California, San Diego, who concluded that Paxlovid rebound occurs when infected cells get insufficient exposure to the drug to stop all viral replication, either because the medication was being metabolized too quickly in some patients or that the drug needs to be given for a longer duration.\n\nWhite House Covid advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci appears to have experienced one of those phenomena, leading to a rebound of his Covid-19 infection after taking Paxlovid.\n\nAfter five days on the drug, he tested negative, then had three consecutive days of negative tests, but on the fourth day tested positive again. Fauci said his symptoms were worse when they returned after treatment, so \u2014 and here\u2019s the interesting part \u2014 his doctors prescribed another course of Paxlovid, and his symptoms improved.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Paxlovid, in the Agency\u2019s April 2022 letter to Pfizer, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, contains this statement:\n\nPAXLOVID is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days\n\nThus, strictly speaking, that second course was impermissible under the EUA\u2026 which gets us back to FDA Commissioner Frank Young\u2019s admonition about regulators\u2019 using common sense.\n\nEven in the absence of definitive data, which would be time-consuming and expensive to accumulate at this point, it would be sensible for the FDA to extend the authorized course of Paxlovid treatment to, say, eight or ten days. It could spare Paxlovid recipients the rebound of Covid symptoms and additional virus-caused damage.\n\nGood medicine, like good regulation, sometimes requires common sense in addition to hard data.\n\nDr. Henry I.

        "text": "T\n\nhe previous pandemics to which people often compare COVID-19 \u2013 the influenza pandemic of 1918 , the Black Death bubonic plague (1342-1353), the Justinian plague (541-542) \u2013 don\u2019t seem that long ago to archaeologists. We\u2019re used to thinking about people who lived many centuries or even millennia ago. Evidence found directly on skeletons shows that infectious diseases have been with us since our beginnings as a species.\n\nBioarchaeologists like us analyze skeletons to reveal more about how infectious diseases originated and spread in ancient times.\n\nHow did aspects of early people\u2019s social behavior allow diseases to flourish? How did people try to care for the sick? How did individuals and entire societies modify behaviors to protect themselves and others?\n\nKnowing these things might help scientists understand why COVID-19 has wreaked such global devastation and what needs to be put in place before the next pandemic.\n\nClues about illnesses long ago\n\nHow can bioarchaeologists possibly know these things, especially for early cultures that left no written record? Even in literate societies, poorer and marginalized segments were rarely written about.\n\nIn most archaeological settings, all that remains of our ancestors is the skeleton.\n\nFor some infectious diseases, like syphilis, tuberculosis and leprosy, the location, characteristics and distribution of marks on a skeleton\u2019s bones can serve as distinctive \u201cpathognomonic\u201d indicators of the infection.\n\nMost skeletal signs of disease are non-specific, though, meaning bioarchaeologists today can tell an individual was sick, but not with what disease. Some diseases never affect the skeleton at all, including plague and viral infections like HIV and COVID-19. And diseases that kill quickly don\u2019t have enough time to leave a mark on victims\u2019 bones.\n\nTo uncover evidence of specific diseases beyond obvious bone changes, bioarchaeologists use a variety of methods, often with the help of other specialists, like geneticists or parasitologists. For instance, analyzing soil collected in a grave from around a person\u2019s pelvis can reveal the remains of intestinal parasites, such as tapeworms and round worms. Genetic analyses can also identify the DNA of infectious pathogens still clinging to ancient bones and teeth.\n\nBioarchaeologists can also estimate age at death based on how developed a youngster\u2019s teeth and bones are, or how much an adult\u2019s skeleton has degenerated over its lifespan. Then demographers help us draw age profiles for populations that died in epidemics. Most infectious diseases disproportionately affect those with the weakest immune systems, usually the very young and very old.\n\nFor instance, the Black Death was indiscriminate; 14th-century burial pits contain the typical age distributions found in cemeteries we know were not for Black Death victims. In contrast, the 1918 flu pandemic was unusual in that it hit hardest those with the most robust immune systems, that is, healthy young adults. COVID-19 today is also leaving a recognizable profile of those most likely to die from the disease, targeting older and vulnerable people and particular ethnic groups.\n\nWe can find out what infections were around in the past through our ancestors\u2019 remains, but what does this tell us about the bigger picture of the origin and evolution of infections? Archaeological clues can help researchers reconstruct aspects of socioeconomic organization, environment and technology. And we can study how variations in these risk factors caused diseases to vary across time, in different areas of the world and even among people living in the same societies.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nHow infectious disease got its first foothold\n\nHuman biology affects culture in complex ways. Culture influences biology, too, although it can be hard for our bodies to keep up with rapid cultural changes. For example, in the 20th century, highly processed fast food replaced a more balanced and healthy diet for many. Because the human body evolved and was designed for a different world, this dietary switch resulted in a rise in diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\nFrom a paleoepidemiological perspective, the most significant event in our species\u2019 history was the adoption of farming. Agriculture arose independently in several places around the world beginning around 12,000 years ago.\n\nPrior to this change, people lived as hunter-gatherers, with dogs as their only animal companions. They were very active and had a well balanced, varied diet that was high in protein and fiber and low in calories and fat. These small groups experienced parasites, bacterial infections and injuries while hunting wild animals and occasionally fighting with one another. They also had to deal with dental problems, including extreme wear, plaque and periodontal disease.\n\nOne thing hunter-gatherers didn\u2019t need to worry much about, however, was virulent infectious diseases that could move quickly from person to person throughout a large geographic region. Pathogens like the influenza virus were not able to effectively spread or even be maintained by small, mobile, and socially isolated populations.\n\nThe advent of agriculture resulted in larger, sedentary populations of people living in close proximity. New diseases could flourish in this new environment. The transition to agriculture was characterized by high childhood mortality, in which approximately 30% or more of children died before the age of 5.\n\nAnd for the first time in an evolutionary history spanning millions of years, different species of mammals and birds became intimate neighbors. Once people began to live with newly domesticated animals, they were brought into the life cycle of a new group of diseases \u2013 called zoonoses \u2013 that previously had been limited to wild animals but could now jump into human beings.\n\nAdd to all this the stresses of poor sanitation and a deficient diet, as well as increased connections between distant communities through migration and trade especially between urban communities, and epidemics of infectious disease were able to take hold for the first time.\n\nGlobalization of disease\n\nLater events in human history also resulted in major epidemiological transitions related to disease.\n\nFor more than 10,000 years, the people of Europe, the Middle East and Asia evolved along with particular zoonoses in their local environments. The animals people were in contact with varied from place to place. As people lived alongside particular animal species over long periods of time, a symbiosis could develop \u2013 as well as immune resistance to local zoonoses.\n\nAt the beginning of modern history, people from European empires also began traveling across the globe, taking with them a suite of \u201cOld World\u201d diseases that were devastating for groups who hadn\u2019t evolved alongside them. Indigenous populations in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas had no biological familiarity with these new pathogens. Without immunity, one epidemic after another ravaged these groups. Mortality estimates range between 60-90%.\n\nThe study of disease in skeletons, mummies and other remains of past people has played a critical role in reconstructing the origin and evolution of pandemics, but this work also provides evidence of compassion and care, including medical interventions such as trepanation, dentistry, amputation and prostheses, herbal remedies and surgical instruments.\n\nOther evidence shows that people have often done their best to protect others, as well as themselves, from disease. Perhaps one of the most famous examples is the English village of Eyam, which made a self-sacrificing decision to isolate itself to prevent further spread of a plague from London in 1665.\n\nIn other eras, people with tuberculosis were placed in sanatoria, people with leprosy were admitted to specialized hospitals or segregated on islands or into remote areas, and urban dwellers fled cities when plagues came.\n\nAs the world faces yet another pandemic, the archaeological and historical record are reminders that people have lived with infectious disease for millennia. Pathogens have helped shape civilization, and humans have been resilient in the face of such crises.\n\nCharlotte Roberts is a Professor of Archeology at Durham University.\n\nGabriel D.

        "text": "\u201cCould THIS twice-daily probiotic supplement filled with gut friendly bacteria help beat Long Covid?\u201d That\u2019s the headline in the Daily Mail earlier this year, one of dozens in the media across the web promoting the miracle of probiotics.\n\nDozens of other news outlets, from Psychology Today to Medical News Today carried the same unfiltered story. Taking a probiotic supplement, they report, could improve COVID recoveries by promoting the \u201cright mix of gut bacteria\u201d to \u201cboost the body\u2019s immune defenses\u201d.\n\nThese are not new claims. Since the COVID crisis commenced more than two years, and based on a few sketchy and inconclusive studies, \u2018natural\u2019 websites have been making claims that probiotic supplements could be the magic bullet to halt or even cure COVID. According to NUTRA Ingredients, which peddles supplements \u201ca probiotic formulation could act as a complementary remedy to slow down the progression of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nIs it too good to be true?\n\nThe answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but with nuance.\n\nThe most recent surge in articles was sparked by a small study out of Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai that suggested \u2018Long Covid\u2019 may be dictated by the microbes in our gut and that probiotics could hold a solution. \u201cThe gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID severity \u2014 possibly via modulating host immune responses,\u201d they claimed.\n\nThis represents another in a line of studies that seem to support the idea that rebalancing the bacteria in our gut may help fight long-term COVID symptoms. In December, for example, researchers at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust presented data claiming to demonstrate that \u201ctwo capsules a day containing a scientifically chosen blend of natural ingredients could help patients suffering from long COVID\u201d.\n\nOncology consultant Prof Robert Thomas was quoted as saying, \u201cSuch a rapid improvement in the majority who had been experiencing symptoms for over eight months was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.\u201d\n\nBut most scientists and researchers are more dubious. Certainly, there is no question that our gut bacteria is linked to our health. Whether tinkering with our gut bacteria using supplements can meaningfully help address COVID, or any disease for that matter, is far more problematic.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nSkepticism\n\nSince COVID first appeared two years, probiotic devotees have been promoting salves and supplements, claiming that they could boost your immunity and ward off the coronavirus. But the curative claims of probiotics has been met with raised eyebrows from the medical and scientific world.\n\nThere is widespread evidence that gut bacteria is linked to our health\u2014it\u2019s just that probiotics have not been shown to improve it as an aid to battling COVID.\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have responded to the COVID claims with skepticism: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that taking probiotics can prevent or treat COVID-19\u201d. They encourage consumers to \u201cbeware of false claims about COVID-19 cures\u201d.\n\nAkiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, was an early voice of caution, challenging probiotics as a COVID-fighting tool. As he told the BBC, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth. In fact, the concept of \u201cboosting\u201d your immune system doesn\u2019t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that many of these claims have no grounding in evidence\u201d. This idea was viewed as a case of \u201cpseudoscientists are peddling trendy products such as kombucha and probiotics\u201d.\n\nIn other words, this idea may be too good to be true for a reason. Such claims during health crises have a long history. During the Spanish flu crisis a century ago, Vick\u2019s VapoRub offered itself as special treatment along with taking laxatives. Crises breed opportunity, and sometimes snake oil salesman. Is that what\u2019s going on here?\n\nDubious claims\n\nCertainly, many of the sites promoting probiotics do their best to make it seem their over-the counter and unregulated probiotic products are medical magic. Take one example claiming to present a \u201cNew breakthrough study in overweight adults on a weight loss program\u201d. It is clear to any objective eye that this is an advertisement with the product taking front and center and minimal information about the alleged supporting study:\n\nOther ads are a little more subtle. Headlines like \u201cShelf-stable or refrigerated: Which probiotic is better for you?\u201d or \u201c5 surprising signs you probably need a probiotic\u201d are designed to convince the reader into thinking there is scientifically useful information to back up the claims.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what you find when you \u201cGo to the breakthrough study results\u201d. Instead, you are transported via hyperlinks to supplements and products along with disclaimers stating, \u201cAny products featured in this article are selected by our editors, who don\u2019t play favorites. If you buy something, we may get a cut of the sale.\u201d\n\nMany promotional websites contain information that is not only scientifically tenuous, but contrary to the latest data. One common example: articles promoting the use of probiotics to counter gut bacteria loss after a course of antibiotics. This is a popular sales pitch but, unfortunately, data such as this study from the Weismann Institute in Israel suggests this is not such a good idea. Immunologist Dr. Eran Elinav explains:\n\nThe evidence for taking probiotics after antibiotics is a little murky and contradictory, but the public perception of many people and some doctors is that this is a good idea, even without substantial medical evidence. Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences. We need to be cautious about recommending this until further knowledge emerges.\n\nTo date, no probiotic has been FDA approved for clinical use, yet supplements flood the market as they remain unregulated in the US and many other countries.. \u201cMarketing of product is often geared directly at consumers without providing direct and consistent proof of effectiveness,\u201d notes the American Gastroenterological Association.\n\nSo how did this latest probiotic craze gain traction?\n\nLet\u2019s review the science.\n\nThe concept of utilizing probiotics as \u201cCOVID cures\u201d appears to have emerged from multiple studies that suggested the cause may lie within our digestive tract. More specifically, the ~100 trillion bacteria and microorganisms within our gut microbiome. They are a key part of our digestive system. Whenever we eat something, it needs to be broken down so that the nutrients can be absorbed and processed by our body. We cannot do this alone. We require assistance from our gut microbes, particularly in the case of complex carbohydrates and fibers. The bacteria in our gut breakdown and ferment these components and release products that can be utilized by our body.\n\nThe gut microbiome has been linked to many chronic illnesses in the past but the actual impact it has is often debated and data can be tenuous at best. Now, a new set of claims that \u201ctaking a capsule of probiotics, which are designed to boost the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, may speed up recovery from the coronavirus\u201d are gaining traction.\n\nThis is further fueled by an initial study from The Chinese University of Hong Kong that reported an increased presence of harmful and pathogenic bacteria in COVID patients with severe/long-term illness. When paired with the depletion of immune-boosting gut bacteria, the reports suggest that the gut microbial changes could directly relate to an increased risk of developing long-COVID. This has led to some concluding that probiotic supplements could be a way to protect against or treat long term complications of COVID-19 by rebalancing such changes in our gut microbes. Prof Siew NG, head of the study, concluded:\n\nThe most surprising findings were that different bacteria patterns were associated with different categories of Long Covid symptoms such as respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, hair loss, etc. Such patterns were characterized by a higher level of \u201cunfriendly\u201d microbes and lower levels of \u201cfriendly\u201d microbes.\n\nIt sounds promising but suggestive news based on incomplete research should always be approached with a considerable caution. First, COVID pathology is complex. It involves a cascade of immune events that can trigger serious consequences in a number of areas of the body. In the words of John Wherry, director of the Penn Medicine Immune Health Institute, \u201cCOVID is deranging the immune system\u201d.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, we should be wary of studies that play into the billion-dollar probiotic industry narrative that untested products hold the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for complex healthcare issue.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic online, \u201cthere is no clear evidence that probiotics are beneficial,\u201d let alone a potential silver bullet to treat COVID.\n\nFor the most part, probiotic supplements have no measurable impact on your gut microbiome diversity and may actually cause harm in some instances. Dr Matthew Ciorba, a gastroenterologist at Washington University in St. Louis, echoes this message, saying, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that people with normal gastrointestinal tracts can benefit from taking probiotics.\u201d\n\nMany supplement suppliers claim their products \u201coptimize your gut.\u201d That\u2019s mumbo jumbo. The average probiotic supplement contains ~2 billion bacteria. That sounds like a lot but when you consider those 2 billion will only account for 0.002% of the 100 trillion microorganisms in your gut, it\u2019s a bit like dropping a salt particle into a gallon of maple syrup and expecting it to taste salty. The impact will be minimal to non-existent in all but a few specific cases of digestive issues.\n\n\u201cEveryone else can save their money, because there\u2019s no evidence that probiotic supplements offer any benefit to already healthy people,\u201d says Prof Jack Gilbert, founder of the American Gut Project.\n\nBeyond the hype\n\nSo why does the hype around a probiotic COVID cure persist? Greed and bad reporting, for the most part.\n\nIt is often generated by cherry picking of data by websites seeking to promote sales of supplements. Many of the probiotic websites are trying to leverage fear generated by COVID to make a sales pitch for other probiotic supplements.\n\nOnce you get past the \u2018miracle COVID cure\u2019 headlines, many articles actually report more sober and less encouraging findings. One article claiming probiotics can treat COVID, for example, included a quote from a researcher in the field: \u201cIt is not that the use of one probiotic will reduce all the problems caused by COVID-19\u201d, with the article going on to state that \u201cthe best case for probiotic therapy has been in the treatment of diarrhea\u201d. Hardly the COVID are touted in the headline!\n\nThe Daily Mail led with the claim that \u201cnow it seems our gut bacteria can also tackle COVID-19\u201d. However, further into the article, the authors of the study are quoted as being much more measured. Professor Andrew Smith (Medical Sciences) offered this measured take on his findings along with a warming about taking probiotics:\n\nThe study excluded those over 60 and did not account for whether volunteers had been vaccinated or not. So, we don\u2019t know if probiotics provide any benefit to those most at risk of severe Covid. And taking probiotics may be inappropriate for those with a weakened immune system because of the potential increased risk of infection from consuming large quantities of live bacteria.\n\nBut probiotics are at least harmless, right?\n\nIf I want to take it as a precaution surely there is no downside to trying it?\n\nUnfortunately, that may not be the case. According to research from\n\nEran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science, taking probiotics in certain scenarios can actually cause harm:\n\nThe probiotics very potently and persistently prevented the original microbiome returning to its original situation. \u2026 This was very surprising and alarming to us. This adverse effect has not been described to date.\n\nSo there is a risk, however minimal, in taking probiotic supplements in the hope of avoiding complications of COVID-19. When you pair that with the lack of tangible evidence of its benefits, there is not much of a case for probiotics as preventative or acute therapy.\n\nIt is very difficult to find any reputable medical professional promoting probiotics as COVID treatments. For the most part, the idea is being pushed forward by supplement pushers, diet promoters or people that will sell you a handy and expensive course to help you \u201coptimize your microbiome\u201d.\n\nProceed with caution when articles claim you can cure disease by changing the bacteria in your gut. Especially when they claim you can start healing yourself with a convenient, over the counter probiotic pill\u2014one that your doctor would never prescribe. It\u2019s a snake oil salesman pushing miracle cures.\n\nSam Moxon has a PhD in tissue engineering and is currently a research fellow in the field of regenerative medicine.

        "text": "Experts share tips for improving mental health as we emerge and heal from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become a big part of our daily lives. Between news reports on it, its economic costs, and the regular updates on local cases, it can feel impossible to escape COVID-19\u2019s effects. Feelings of increased anxiety, uneasiness, and fear are far from uncommon \u2014 even when people seem to be thriving at home as they pick up new hobbies or read through their entire home libraries. If you\u2019re still feeling like it\u2019s difficult to move through your day, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected our mental health? We\u2019re just starting to truly understand the mental health effects of the past year. \u201cEveryone is experiencing this pandemic and quarantine differently,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Myszak, a child psychologist. \u201cAn apt description I\u2019ve heard is that we are all in the same storm, but we are in different types of boats.\u201d The mental health impact on adults What we do know is that living through a pandemic has removed many foundations we used to rely on, like a stable income, a social support system, and food security. That\u2019s why 2 in 5 U.S. adults reported difficulties with mental health issues and substance use in June 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Nearly 1 in 3 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Mental health professionals have also seen an increase in the number of people seeking professional help and therapy. Even as the pandemic passes its 1-year anniversary, approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults still experience high levels of distress. Many people who were required to report to their workplace in person faced daily stress and fears of contracting the coronavirus in addition to financial insecurity. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 found 34% of adults in the United States were classified as \u201cessential.\u201d Among them: Almost 1 in 3 said they would have to put an unexpected $500 medical bill on a credit card or borrow money.\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 said they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay it. This type of financial insecurity can add up to an often draining work environment for people who didn\u2019t have the option to work from home. Parents whose kids were (or are) learning remotely \u2014 or were home due to trouble finding day care \u2014 may have also grappled with additional concerns. \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on parents, particularly parents of younger children,\u201d explains Christopher Beevers, professor and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn many cases, the parents have had to take on multiple roles \u2014 caregiver, teacher, parent \u2014 with few opportunities to take a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSimultaneously, many parents are also supposed to be working from home with their own set of deadlines and work responsibilities. This sort of multitasking is highly stressful and puts a huge burden on the family unit,\u201d Beevers says. If you\u2019re still not sure how the pandemic has affected your mental health, you can use this checklist to get some clarity. The mental health impact on children and teens It isn\u2019t just adults who have experienced mental health effects. Children\u2019s mental health may have been affected by disruptions to their schoolwork, learning, and social lives. An estimated 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school closures. This left many feeling isolated and disoriented by the lack of school routine and the difficulties that come with remote learning. \u201cFor many students, online school has been an extreme challenge due to difficulty focusing and staying on task while attending school from home,\u201d explains Kristel Roper, LMFT, LPCC. \u201cStudents with ADHD or other conditions that can make learning difficult have been even more negatively affected by the recent changes.\u201d Because of the school closures, some children with extra developmental needs have been less likely to be noticed and have their needs addressed by their teachers. Myszak explains, \u201cChildren who would be identified in school as needing additional support may not be coming to the attention of the school, so they are not getting the services they need.\u201d There\u2019s also been an increase in reported thoughts of suicide and self-harm among young adults. A recent report from Mental Health America showed an increase in these thoughts, especially among LGBTQIA+ youth. Suicide prevention If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you\u2019re not alone. Help is available right now: You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.\n\nContact the teen-to-teen peer hotline Teen Line at 800-852-8336 or text TEEN to 839863. Not in the United States? You can find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected people who already have a mental health condition? If you have an existing mental health condition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some symptoms worse. \u201cIndividuals with anxiety often benefit from increased structure, positive social interactions, and spending time engaging in valued activities,\u201d Roper explains. \u201cAll of these have been made much more difficult by the quarantine.\u201d In addition, physical distancing measures have made it more difficult for some people to find help when dealing with loss or substance use, as many mental health professionals and support groups moved online. According to the CDC, there was an 18.2% increase in overdose-related deaths that accelerated around the time stay-at-home orders were put in place. \u201cSome have referred to the pandemic as an \u2018accelerant\u2019 that has exposed or exacerbated many vulnerabilities in society,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cPeople who have experienced depression in the past or had mild symptoms leading into the pandemic were very likely at high risk for experiencing depression during the pandemic,\u201d he says.\n\nTips to support your mental health through the pandemic Even as we continue to move forward, many people will be reeling and healing from the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While time may be part of the healing equation, there\u2019s a lot you can do now to take care of your mental health. And the rise of online therapy options has made professional mental healthcare more accessible for many people. Here are a few ways to care for your mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Create a daily routine Our daily work commute and office routine were some of the first things to change with the pandemic. If you once had a strict train, mealtime, or day care pickup schedule, staying at home was a real shake-up to your daily routine. That\u2019s why it can help to create a personal daily routine. \u201cI would highly recommend creating your own structure through a routine that you follow each day,\u201d Roper says. For example, it can be helpful to wake up and eat meals at the same time. Focus on reducing stress Making time to take care of yourself can help you better handle the stressors in your life. Like a car trying to run without gas, your capacity to deal with stress may be limited if your physical and mental health are running on empty. \u201cI always recommend starting [with] the basics: eating well and exercising,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cEven just a 15- to 30-minute walk each day can help ease stress and anxiety.\u201d And if you enjoy meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music and sounds, you might schedule time to engage in these activities. Set boundaries between work and home life When you were still working in the office or on location for your job, the act of physically clocking out and heading home was a natural way to transition out of your workday. But when you\u2019re working from home, it can be tough to leave the workday behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to set boundaries between work time and home time. For example, you could \u201ccommute\u201d to another room in your house to work, and leave that room (and work computer) behind when you end your day. If you have a home-based job with nonspecific hours, consider setting a regular work schedule to help prevent tasks from carrying over into your personal time. This can be especially true for parents working at home with their children. \u201cBeing able to turn off the computer, silence the phone, and engage in play and fun activities will speak volumes to children seeking attention,\u201d Myszak says. \u201cShowing children you are willing to spend time with them will be much more effective than anything you would say to them.\u201d Talk with a mental health professional Many resources are available to help you manage mental health challenges during the pandemic. Online therapy is becoming more popular, and it\u2019s proving effective for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you\u2019re interested in finding mental health support online, here are some free online therapy and support services and 10 free mental health apps to get started. Some local and national support groups can also help free of cost. While these alternatives may not be as personalized as one-on-one therapy, it can help to talk with a community of people who\u2019ve had similar experiences. These groups may also help if you\u2019re dealing with loneliness or isolation, because they allow you to interact and talk with people digitally. Mental Health America has also created an extensive list of support groups that can help you find support if you\u2019re dealing with mental health symptoms, domestic violence, or addiction. Be kind to yourself This idea gets repeated so often that it can be hard to remember what it truly means. Practicing kindness toward yourself can mean treating yourself like you\u2019d treat a loved one when you\u2019re feeling not so great. \u201cWe can be our own worst critics,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cA little self-compassion can go a long way towards feeling better. We are all doing the best that we can under incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s role in mental health Many people are feeling relief after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For them, it has helped lower anxiety about contracting the virus, being hospitalized, or dying as a result of the disease. Still, many people have been skeptical of the vaccine\u2019s accelerated rollout and possible side effects. This remains a real concern among some people in the United States. \u201cFor those who are wary of the vaccine, I always recommend doing your research,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is ask your own trusted healthcare team. They\u2019ll be able to share their professional opinions with your specific needs in mind.\u201d You can also talk with friends and family about their experiences during the pandemic and with the vaccine. Since so much of the pandemic was marked by distancing our relationships, there\u2019s great potential for healing as we start to slowly and safely reunite. \u201cFor many, the vaccine rollout has brought with it a collective sigh of relief,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cIt has also likely been highly emotional for many as we begin to see our loved ones, friends, neighbors, and communities get the vaccine and feel, for the first time in a while, that feeling of hope.\u201d"

Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021.\n\nThe researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility.\n\nWhile COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction.\n\n\u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d\n\nThe new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination."

        "text": "A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.\n\nThe trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.\n\nThis vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?\n\nWhat\u2019s in the mix?\n\nVaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.\n\nAll vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.\n\nWe often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.\n\nBy targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.\n\nHowever, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.\n\nSo instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.\n\nThe spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided\n\nRethinking an influenza vaccine\n\nThe Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.\n\nThe NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).\n\nIn October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.\n\nAn important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.\n\nThis trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial.\n\nAntibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.\n\nThese results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.\n\nSo the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock\n\nThe Australian clinical trial\n\nThe new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nSome volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.\n\nThe trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.\n\nAll groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.\n\nThis design enables researchers to ask four important questions:\n\ncan the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough?\n\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.\n\nAnd we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nWe eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.\n\nBy Kylie Quinn, Vice-Chancellor's Research Fellow, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University and Kirsty Wilson, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, RMIT University.

Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division.\n\nConfusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy.\n\nIf the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way.\n\nSimilarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories.\n\nWhat to look out for\n\nSource. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly.\n\nLogo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website.\n\nBad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions.\n\nPretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this.\n\nOver-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works.\n\nUse fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media.\n\nWho to trust\n\nThe best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles.\n\nEven government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields.\n\nA time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young/EPA\n\nCharlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19.\n\nThe effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nWe can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.\n\nBy Samantha Vanderslott, Postdoctoral Researcher in Social Sciences, University of Oxford.

        "link": "https://scienceblogs.com/sb-admin/2021/10/22/doomscrolling-covid-19-news-takes-emotional-toll-here-how-prevent-151457",
        "text": "Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling.\n\nIf this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time?\n\nResearch on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt.\n\nThese findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis?\n\nTo find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all.\n\nPeople who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted.\n\nThese findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood.\n\nAlthough we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood.\n\nMaking your social media a more positive place\n\nOur research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does.\n\nSo what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable?\n\nWe found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee/Shutterstock\n\nOne option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020.\n\nBut how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible?\n\nGiven that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive.\n\nBe mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think.\n\nImportantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.\n\nBy Kathryn Buchanan, Lecturer, Psychology Department, University of Essex; Gillian Sandstrom, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychology, University of Essex; Lara Aknin, Distinguished Associate Professor of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, and Shaaba Lotun, PhD candidate, Department of Psychology, University of Essex.

        "link": "https://scienceblogs.com/sb-admin/2020/03/30/virtual-communication-during-social-distancing-how-we-change-when-we-know-were",
        "text": "Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom.\n\nBut how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them.\n\nPeople are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates.\n\nThroughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication.\n\nCo-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation.\n\nSimilarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task.\n\nThree areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University\n\nResults of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition.\n\nThere were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them.\n\nTo simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior.\n\n\"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\"\n\nThere was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face.\n\nComparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions.\n\n\"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\""

        "title": "\\n How to protect your children during heat waves\\n",
        "link": "https://www.popsci.com/health/children-danger-heat-waves/",
        "text": "This article was originally featured on KHN.\n\nAfter more than a week of record-breaking temperatures across much of the country, public health experts are cautioning that children are more susceptible to heat illness than adults are\u2014even more so when they\u2019re on the athletic field, living without air conditioning, or waiting in a parked car.\n\nCases of heat-related illness are rising with average air temperatures, and experts say almost half of those getting sick are children. The reason is twofold: Children\u2019s bodies have more trouble regulating temperature than those of adults, and they rely on adults to help protect them from overheating.\n\nParents, coaches, and other caretakers, who can experience the same heat very differently than kids do, may struggle to identify a dangerous situation or catch the early symptoms of heat-related illness in children.\n\n\u201cChildren are not little adults,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatric hospitalist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nJan Null, a meteorologist in California, recalled being surprised at the effect of heat in a car. It was 86 degrees on a July afternoon more than two decades ago when an infant in San Jose was forgotten in a parked car and died of heatstroke.\n\nNull said a reporter asked him after the death, \u201cHow hot could it have gotten in that car?\u201d\n\nNull\u2019s research with two emergency doctors at Stanford University eventually produced a startling answer. Within an hour, the temperature in that car could have exceeded 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Their work revealed that a quick errand can be dangerous for a kid left behind in the car\u2014even for less than 15 minutes, even with the windows cracked, and even on a mild day.\n\nAs record heat becomes more frequent, posing serious risks even to healthy adults, the number of cases of heat-related illnesses has gone up, including among children. Those most at risk are young children in parked vehicles and adolescents returning to school and participating in sports during the hottest days of the year.\n\nMore than 9,000 high school athletes are treated for heat-related illnesses every year.\n\nHeat-related illnesses occur when exposure to high temperatures and humidity, which can be intensified by physical exertion, overwhelms the body\u2019s ability to cool itself. Cases range from mild, like benign heat rashes in infants, to more serious, when the body\u2019s core temperature increases. That can lead to life-threatening instances of heatstroke, diagnosed once the body temperature rises above 104 degrees, potentially causing organ failure.\n\nPrevention is key. Experts emphasize that drinking plenty of water, avoiding the outdoors during the hot midday and afternoon hours, and taking it slow when adjusting to exercise are the most effective ways to avoid getting sick.\n\nChildren\u2019s bodies take longer to increase sweat production and otherwise acclimatize in a warm environment than adults\u2019 do, research shows. Young kids are also more susceptible to dehydration because a larger percentage of their body weight is water.\n\nInfants and younger children also have more trouble regulating their body temperature, in part because they often don\u2019t recognize when they should drink more water or remove clothing to cool down. A 1995 study showed that young children who spent 30 minutes in a 95-degree room saw their core temperatures rise significantly higher and faster than their mothers\u2019\u2014even though they sweat more than adults do relative to their size.\n\nPediatricians advise caretakers to monitor how much water children consume and encourage them to drink before they ask for it. Thirst indicates the body is already dehydrated.\n\nThey should also dress kids in light-colored, lightweight clothes; limit outdoor time during the hottest hours; and look for ways to cool down, such as by visiting an air-conditioned place like a library, taking a cool bath, or going for a swim.\n\nTo address the risks to student athletes, the National Athletic Trainers\u2019 Association recommends that high school athletes acclimatize by gradually building their activity over the course of two weeks when returning to their sport for a new season\u2014including by slowly stepping up the amount of any protective equipment they wear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gradually increasing that intensity over a week to two weeks so your body can get used to the heat,\u201d said Kathy Dieringer, president of NATA.\n\nWarning signs and solutions\n\nExperts note a flushed face, fatigue, muscle cramps, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and a lot of sweating are among the symptoms of heat exhaustion, which can develop into heatstroke if untreated. Call a doctor if symptoms worsen, such as if the child seems disoriented or cannot drink.\n\nTaking immediate steps to cool a child experiencing heat exhaustion or heatstroke is critical. The child should be taken to a shaded or cool area; be given cool fluids with salt, like sports drinks; and have any sweaty or heavy garments removed.\n\nFor adolescents, being submerged in an ice bath is the most effective way to cool the body, while younger children can be wrapped in cold, wet towels or misted with lukewarm water and placed in front of a fan.\n\nAlthough children\u2019s deaths in parked cars have been well documented, the tragic incidents continue to occur. According to federal statistics, 23 children died of vehicular heatstroke in 2021. Null, who collects his own data, said 13 children have died so far this year.\n\nCaretakers should never leave children alone in a parked car, Null said. Take steps to prevent young children from entering the car themselves and becoming trapped, including locking the car while it\u2019s parked at home.\n\nMore than half of cases of vehicular pediatric heatstroke occur because a caretaker accidentally left a child behind, he said. While in-car technology reminding adults to check their back seats has become more common, only a fraction of vehicles have it, requiring parents to come up with their own methods, like leaving a stuffed animal in the front seat.\n\nThe good news, Null said, is that simple behavioral changes can protect kids. \u201cThis is preventable in 100% of the cases,\u201d he said.\n\nA lopsided risk\n\nPeople living in low-income areas fare worse when temperatures climb. Access to air conditioning, which includes the ability to afford the electricity bill, is a serious health concern.\n\nA study of heat in urban areas released last year showed that low-income neighborhoods and communities of color experience much higher temperatures than those of wealthier, white residents. In more impoverished areas during the summer, temperatures can be as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors said their findings in the United States reflect that \u201cthe legacy of redlining looms large,\u201d referring to a federal housing policy that refused to insure mortgages in or near predominantly Black neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThese areas have less tree canopy, more streets, and higher building densities, meaning that in addition to their other racist outcomes, redlining policies directly codified into law existing disparity in urban land use and reinforced urban design choices that magnify urban heating into the present,\u201d they concluded.\n\nThis month, Bernstein, who leads Harvard\u2019s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, co-authored a commentary in JAMA arguing that advancing health equity is critical to action on climate change.\n\nThe center works with front-line health clinics to help their predominantly low-income patients respond to the health impacts of climate change. Federally backed clinics alone provide care to about 30 million Americans, including many children, he said.\n\nBernstein also recently led a nationwide study that found that from May through September, days with higher temperatures are associated with more visits to children\u2019s hospital emergency rooms. Many visits were more directly linked to heat, although the study also pointed to how high temperatures can exacerbate existing health conditions like neurological disorders.\n\n\u201cChildren are more vulnerable to climate change through how these climate shocks reshape the world in which they grow up,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nHelping people better understand the health risks of extreme heat and how to protect themselves and their families are among the public health system\u2019s major challenges, experts said.\n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s heat alert system is mainly based on the heat index, a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored in with air temperature.\n\nBut the alerts are not related to effects on health, said Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. By the time temperatures rise to the level that a weather alert is issued, many vulnerable people\u2014like children, pregnant women, and the elderly\u2014may already be experiencing heat exhaustion or heatstroke.\n\nThe center developed a new heat alert system, which is being tested in Seville, Spain, historically one of the hottest cities in Europe.\n\nThe system marries metrics like air temperature and humidity with public health data to categorize heat waves and, when they are serious enough, give them names \u2014 making it easier for people to understand heat as an environmental threat that requires prevention measures.\n\nThe categories are determined through a metric known as excess deaths, which compares how many people died on a day with the forecasted temperature versus an average day. That may help health officials understand how severe a heat wave is expected to be and make informed recommendations to the public based on risk factors like age or medical history.\n\nThe health-based alert system would also allow officials to target caretakers of children and seniors through school systems, preschools, and senior centers, Baughman McLeod said.\n\nGiving people better ways to conceptualize heat is critical, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic. It doesn\u2019t rip the roof off of your house,\u201d Baughman McLeod said. \u201cIt\u2019s silent and invisible.\u201d\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

I used to think that the HPV vaccine brought the most hatred and misinformation from the anti-vaccine world, but it\u2019s clear that the new COVID-19 vaccines are their new targets.\n\nThis article will only focus on the five vaccines that I believe will eventually receive FDA or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval \u2013 Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ Janssen), and Novavax vaccines. I remain unconvinced that any vaccine made in China or the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will ever get approved by countries with robust drug regulatory agencies. However, if they are, I will certainly add them to a future iteration of this list.\n\nI\u2019m going to make this in a basic chart form for ease of use in finding COVID-19 vaccine facts and myths. I will link to supporting evidence wherever relevant.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine facts\n\nCOVID-19 myths\n\nSummary\n\nAs you can tell, most of the COVID-19 vaccine facts are supported by science-based evidence. And the myths are unsupported by the evidence.\n\nI plan to update this easy-to-read list of COVID-19 vaccine facts and myths as I run across more nonsense. I intend to always add links that support or refute the claim. I hope that this article is helpful to those of you who are having discussions with people who are on the fence about these vaccines.\n\nIf you have any new myths, claims, or facts about the COVID-19 vaccines, please post them in the comments below.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "title": "What are the links between vitamin D and COVID?",
        "link": "https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/what-are-the-links-between-vitamin-d-and-covid/",
        "text": "Across the internet, I keep reading about some relationships between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I\u2019ve written about it twice (here and here), but I have never seen reliable, robust, and repeated clinical trial data that supports a link between vitamin D levels or deficiencies and COVID-19.\n\nSo, I thought I would take a look at it once again, and see if there\u2019s anything there. I keep wondering if vitamin D is just another \u201cmiracle supplement\u201d that, once you scratch the surface of data, you find that there is actually nothing there.\n\nWhat we know or think we know about COVID-19 seems to change daily, partially because the disease caught us by surprise. But every day we seem to get new data that contradicts something we thought or adds to our knowledge of the disease. And sometimes both.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current data on vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nPhoto by ready made on Pexels.com\n\nWhat is vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids (it\u2019s a scientific name for steroids with a \u201cbroken\u201d ring). The most important chemicals in this group are vitamin D 3 (known as cholecalciferol) and D 2 (known as ergocalciferol).\n\nGenerally, when we measure vitamin D levels in the blood, we measure calcifediol (also written as 25(OH)D), which is a form of vitamin D produced in the liver by the hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.\n\nVery few foods contain either of the important types of vitamin D. However, some foods can be good sources of the vitamin:\n\nFatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon\n\nFoods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals\n\nBeef liver\n\nCheese\n\nEgg yolks\n\nMany people with broad diets that include a lot of fish, eggs, and other foods can get sufficient vitamin D without supplementation. As I\u2019ve repeated often, short of chronic malnutrition, we get plenty of vitamin D.\n\nMoreover, vitamin D is produced by a process called dermal synthesis. That is, sunlight, specifically UV-B radiation, causes the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Technically, vitamin D isn\u2019t a vitamin, because we can manufacture it, it is a hormone. For this article, we\u2019ll just call it a vitamin, even though scientifically it is not.\n\nAlthough we can manufacture sufficient vitamin D by sunbathing every day, the body has a feedback loop that shuts down production to prevent toxicity. Yes, excess vitamin D is quite dangerous leading to many conditions such as over-absorption of calcium, from hypertension to fatigue. But it also can lead to some dangerous chronic conditions that we\u2019ll discuss later.\n\nAlthough humans can manufacture vitamin D by sitting in bright sun, there\u2019s one major problem \u2013 the risk of skin cancer. As I\u2019ve written before, there are very few ways to prevent cancer, but staying out of the sun is one of them.\n\nFinally, the vitamin D we consume or produce in sunlight is not biologically active. It is generally activated by enzymatic conversion (in a process called hydroxylation) in the kidneys and liver so that the body can use it.\n\nWhat does vitamin D do or don\u2019t do?\n\nBased on real scientific evidence, vitamin D has a very narrow, but important, set of effects.\n\nFirst, it is responsible for enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc, important minerals for the continued health of any human being. Many of these minerals (and vitamin D itself) are necessary for good bone health.\n\nSecond, since vitamin D is important to calcium homeostasis and metabolism, a deficiency of the vitamin results in rickets, or the adult form of the disease, osteomalacia. Rickets, because it happens in immature bones, leads to frequent fractures and skeletal deformities. Osteomalacia, because it occurs in adults with fully formed bones, usually only results in numerous fractures.\n\nAt this point, that\u2019s it. Robust evidence only supports those two physiological effects.\n\nHowever, here are a few claims made by the supplement-pushing crowd:\n\nDespite this utter lack of evidence, vitamin D has continued to be the panacea for all that ails humans. For those of us who only care about large, high-quality, peer-reviewed studies, vitamin D is overrated, unless you need to prevent rickets.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.com\n\nVitamin D and COVID-19 \u2014 clinical evidence\n\nAfter over two years of this pandemic, I assumed that there would be a lot of clinical evidence that would be published on the links (or lack thereof) between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I am not going to review every single clinical trial that\u2019s been published because that would take forever. I\u2019m going to focus on high-quality studies (specifically systematic reviews or meta-analyses, which are at the top of the hierarchy of medical research) if any are available.\n\nIn a systematic review published in June 2021, the researchers examined 31 peer-reviewed observational studies that examined potential links between COVID-19 and vitamin D. There results did not find any statistically significant associations between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. Many of the studies were of poor design or poor quality.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nWhile the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.\n\nAnother systematic review, published on 28 June 2021, showed a similar lack of association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. They examined five studies, which included a total of 467 patients (an incredibly small number), vitamin D levels were not linked to reduced mortality, reduced ICU admissions, and reduced requirements for ventilation.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nNo significant difference with vitamin-D supplementation on major health related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required addressing this topic.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 10 October 2020, the researchers were a bit more enthusiastic about vitamin D and COVID-19. The researchers analyzed six clinical studies. They found that patients with significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D had statistically higher risks of poorer COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe authors concluded that:\n\nSerum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients\u2019 potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 19 May 2021, researchers examined results from 532 patients in three separate studies. There appeared to be a statistically lower ICU requirement in those who received vitamin D supplementation compared to those that didn\u2019t.\n\nIn one more meta-analysis published on 23 September 2021, the researchers examined 21 studies that were found to be relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection/outcomes. This included 205,869 total patients. I would consider this to be the most robust of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews that I have examined.\n\nThe results of this meta-analysis were:\n\nIndividuals with low serum vitamin D levels were 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19.\n\nwere 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19. The researchers found that people with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L were 2.42X more likely to have severe COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that low vitamin D levels did not affect COVID-19 mortality.\n\nSummary\n\nSo what are our takeaways from all of this data?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit all over the place, though the final meta-analysis I reviewed seemed to provide good (but not great) evidence that supports the hypothesis that lower blood vitamin D levels may lead to worse outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nBut that leads to two important claims made about vitamin D:\n\nThere is no evidence vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 except when used as a supplement when someone has a known vitamin D deficiency. Megadoses of vitamin D can be dangerous and do not improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know why low vitamin D levels are linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It could be that individuals with low vitamin D levels have a lower immune response compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. And no, this does not mean that more vitamin D is going to miraculously boost your immune system so that COVID-19 will never strike. Get that out of your thinking immediately, because none of this evidence supports such a claim.\n\nAnd one more thing \u2014 we have zero evidence regarding vitamin D levels and outcomes from the new omicron variants. Maybe it\u2019s the same as COVID-19 in general, or maybe there\u2019s a difference. We will see.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nHeadlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context.\n\nThree points need to be made:\n\nFirst, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption.\n\nSecond, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing.\n\nThird, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground.\n\nPhoto by cottonbro on Pexels.com\n\nBackground on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit\n\nApparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option.\n\nOut of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned.\n\nFourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context.\n\nLegal context\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before.\n\nBut for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains:\n\nGenerally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation.\n\nHowever, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show.\n\nIn short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions.\n\nIn addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule.\n\nAnd again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere.\n\nThis looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds.\n\nNot only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions.\n\nThis is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis.\n\nAs a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement.\n\nPhoto by Leon Seibert on Unsplash\n\nThe Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement\n\nThe settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts.\n\nFinancial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid).\n\nIn addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit.\n\nWork-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague.\n\nWhy did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming:\n\nInitially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "text": "Long-term symptoms of COVID-19\n\nLong COVID or Long-haul COVID[1] is a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting or appearing after the typical convalescence period of COVID-19. It is also known as post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-COVID-19 condition,[2][3] post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or chronic COVID syndrome (CCS).[4][5][6] Long COVID can affect nearly every organ system, with sequelae (consequences) including respiratory system disorders, nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.[7] A wide range of symptoms are commonly reported, including fatigue, malaise, headaches, shortness of breath, anosmia (loss of smell), parosmia (distorted smell), muscle weakness, low fever and cognitive dysfunction.[8]\n\nThe exact nature of symptoms and the number of people who experience long-term symptoms are unknown; these vary according to the definition used, the population being studied, and the time period used in the study. A survey by the UK Office for National Statistics estimated that about 14% of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced one or more symptoms for longer than three months.[9] A study from the University of Oxford of 273,618 survivors of COVID-19, mainly from the United States, showed that about 37% experienced one or more symptoms between three and six months after diagnosis.[10]\n\nWhile studies into various aspects of long COVID are under way,[11][12] as of November 2021 , the definition of the illness is still unclear, as is its mechanism. Health systems in some countries and jurisdictions have been mobilized to deal with this group of patients by creating specialized clinics and providing advice.[13][14][15] Overall, however, it is considered by default to be a diagnosis of exclusion.[16]\n\nA review suggests that global prevalence of long COVID conditions after infection could be as high as 43%, with the most common symptoms being fatigue and memory problems.[17][18]\n\nTerminology and definitions\n\nOverview\n\nLong COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London.[19][20]\n\nLong COVID has no single, strict definition.[21][22] It is normal and expected that people who experience severe symptoms or complications such as post-intensive care syndrome or secondary infections will take longer to recover than people who did not require hospitalization (called mild COVID-19[23]) and had no such complications. It can be difficult to determine whether an individual's set of ongoing symptoms represents a normal, prolonged convalescence, or extended 'long COVID'. One rule of thumb is that long COVID represents symptoms that have been present for longer than two months, though there is no reason to believe that this choice of cutoff is specific to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[21]\n\nWorld Health Organization clinical case definition\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) established a clinical case definition in October 2021,[2] published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases:[3]\n\npost-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms might be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms might also fluctuate or relapse over time.\n\nBritish definition\n\nThe British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) divides COVID-19 into three clinical case definitions:\n\nacute COVID-19 for signs and symptoms during the first four weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first, and\n\nfor signs and symptoms during the first four weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first, and long Covid for new or ongoing symptoms four weeks or more after the start of acute COVID-19 , which is divided into the other two: ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 for effects from four to twelve weeks after onset, and post-COVID-19 syndrome for effects that persist 12 or more weeks after onset.\n\n, which is divided into the other two:\n\nNICE describes the term long COVID, which it uses \"in addition to the clinical case definitions\", as \"commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19. It includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (from four to twelve weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (12 weeks or more)\".[24]\n\nNICE defines post-COVID-19 syndrome as \"Signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID\u201119, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. It usually presents with clusters of symptoms, often overlapping, which can fluctuate and change over time and can affect any system in the body. Post\u2011COVID\u201119 syndrome may be considered before 12 weeks while the possibility of an alternative underlying disease is also being assessed\".[24]\n\nAmerican definition\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins indicated long COVID symptoms for individuals who \"don't recover fully over a period of a few weeks\" be collectively referred to as \"Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection\" (PASC). The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms can persist for months and can range from mild to incapacitating, with new symptoms arising well after the time of infection.[25] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) term Post-Covid Conditions qualifies long Covid as symptoms four or more weeks after first infection.[1]\n\nSymptoms\n\n[26][27] scientific review identified over 50 apparent long-term effects \u2013 including those of 'long COVID' \u2013 along with their estimated prevalence and estimated that 80% of included patients had at least one overall effect beyond two weeks.\n\nA multinational online survey with 3,762 participants with illness lasting more than 28 days found that recovery takes longer than 35 weeks for 91% of them. On average, participants experienced 56 symptoms (standard deviation \u00b1 25.5) in nine organ systems. Symptoms varied over time, and the most common symptoms after six months were fatigue, post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction.[28]\n\nSymptom relapse occurred in 86% of participants triggered by physical or mental effort or by stress. Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.[28]\n\nSymptoms reported by people with long COVID include:[29][30][31][32][33][7][34]\n\nEpidemiology\n\nIn June 2022, a CDC study based on electronic health records showed that \"one in five COVID-19 survivors aged 18\u201364 years and one in four survivors aged \u226565 years experienced at least one incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19\" or long COVID[39][40] and an analysis of private healthcare claims showed that of 78,252 patients diagnosed with 'long COVID', 75.8% had not been hospitalized for COVID-19.[41][42] In people age 0-18 years the prevalence of long COVID conditions \u2013 like mood symptoms, CFS and sleep disorders \u2013 appears to be at ~25% overall.[43][44]\n\nEarlier findings\n\nSome reports of long-term illness after infection appeared early during the COVID-19 pandemic,[45][46] including in people who had a mild (not requiring hospitalization)[47] or moderate (requiring oxygen supplementation)[47] initial infection[48] as well as those who were admitted to hospital with more severe infection.[49][50][scientific citation needed]\n\nAs of January 2021 , the precise incidence was unknown. The incidence declines over time as many people slowly recover. Some early studies suggested that between 20% and 33% of people with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting longer than a month.[51][52] A telephone survey in the U.S. in the first half of 2020 showed that about 35% of people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced a range of symptoms that lasted longer than three weeks.[52] As of December 2020, the Office of National Statistics in the UK estimated that, of all people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, about 21% experienced symptoms for longer than five weeks, and about 10% experienced symptoms for longer than 12 weeks.[51][53][54]\n\nSome studies have suggested that some children experience lingering symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.[51][55][56]\n\nAlthough anyone who gets infected can develop long COVID, people who become so sick that they require hospitalization take longer to recover. A majority (up to 80%[57]) of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease experience long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).[46][58][59] Patients with severe initial infection, particularly those who required mechanical ventilation to help breathing, are also likely to develop post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[49]\n\nA study of patients who had been hospitalised in Wuhan found that the majority still had at least one symptom after six months. Patients who had been more severely ill still showed severe incapacity in lung function.[32] Among the 1733 patients who had been discharged from hospital and followed up about six months later, the most common symptoms were fatigue or muscle weakness (63%), sleep difficulties (26%), and anxiety or depression (23%).[60]\n\nSome people develop long-term neurological symptoms despite never having been hospitalized for COVID-19; the first study of this population was published in March 2021. Most frequently, these non-hospitalized patients experienced \"prominent and persistent 'brain fog' and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life.\"[61][62]\n\nA January 2021 study of UK patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and discharged in 2020 reported that within 140 days, 29% were readmitted to hospital, and 12% of the discharged total had died. Cardivascular and respiratory problems were common, and 5% of patients developed diabetes for the first time.[63]\n\nIn March 2021, the Indonesian Doctors Association, in a survey of 463 people, suggested that 63.5% of respondents self-reported lingering symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exact set of symptoms was not specified; however, according to the article, fatigue and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by muscle pain and headache.[64]\n\nIn May 2021, a global systematic review led by researchers at Stanford University reported that a wide variety of symptoms persisted in more than 70% of COVID-19 patients months after recovering from the initial phase of the disease. Most patients in this study were previously hospitalized. The most common lingering symptoms included shortness of breath, fatigue, and sleep disorders. The study reported 84 clinical signs or symptoms, including loss of taste and smell, cognitive disorders such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, depression, and anxiety.[65]\n\nIn June 2021, a long-term study in Bergen, Norway, found 52% (31/61) of a cohort of home-isolated young adults cases, ages 16\u201330, continued to experience symptoms at six months. The study captured 82% (312) of the pandemic first wave cases: 247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized.[66][67]\n\nIn August 2021, a study of 1,276 hospital survivors of the early 2020 outbreak in Wuhan reported that, while many symptoms disappeared over time and 88% of those previously employed returned to their original work, 49% of them had at least one sequela 12 months after discharge from the hospital, and the general health status of the group was lower than that of the control population. Women had a greater chance of fatigue, muscle weakness, anxiety, depression, or impaired lung diffusion than men. The study also found that survivors are at greater risk for psychiatric outcomes such as anxiety and depression.[68]\n\nAt first, there was little data on long COVID following breakthrough infections (cases in fully vaccinated people).[69] In July 2021, a study with 1,497 fully vaccinated healthcare professionals in Israel reported that 19% of those testing positive (7 out of 36 infected people) also had long COVID-19 symptoms at 6 weeks or more, with the Alpha variant identified in 85% of positive cases.[70] A September 2021 study published in The Lancet found that having two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine halved the odds of long COVID.[71] However, a May 2022 study published by Nature that examined VA Saint Louis Health Care System records from January to December 2021 of more than 13 million people, including 34,000 people vaccinated against COVID-19 who had breakthrough infections, found that COVID-19 vaccination reduced long COVID risk by about 15%.[72]\n\nAn October 2021 meta-analysis showed that more than 60% of individuals infected by SARS-CoV\u20112 exhibited at least one post-COVID-19 symptom after onset or hospital admission.[73]\n\nCauses\n\nIt is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for weeks or months longer.[74] Although the exact processes that cause long COVID remain unknown, a number of mechanisms have been suggested.\n\nA March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:[75]\n\ndirect toxicity in virus infected tissue, especially the lungs\n\nongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation\n\nvascular injury and ischemia caused by virus induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)\n\nimpaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 containing tissue\n\nIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:[46][76]\n\nOther situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:\n\nSimilarities to other syndromes\n\nLong COVID is similar to post-Ebola syndrome and the post-infection syndromes seen in chikungunya and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is often triggered by infection and immune activation and was previously also known as \"post-viral fatigue\". The pathophysiology of long COVID may be similar to these other conditions.[21] Some long COVID patients in Canada have been diagnosed with ME/CFS, a \"debilitating, multi-system neurological disease that is believed to be triggered by an infectious illness in the majority of cases\". Lucinda Bateman, a US specialist in ME/CFS in Salt Lake City, believes that the two syndromes are identical. There is need for more research into ME/CFS; Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the US government, said that COVID-19 is a \"well-identified etiologic agent that should be very helpful now in getting us to be able to understand [ME/CFS]\".[82]\n\nRisk factors\n\nAccording to a King's College London study initially posted on 21 October 2020 risk factors for long COVID may include:[83][84][85]\n\nAge \u2013 particularly those aged over 50\n\nObesity [86]\n\nAsthma\n\nReporting more than five symptoms (e.g., more than a cough, fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, loss of sense of smell) in the first week of COVID-19 infection; five is the median number reported\n\nGender \u2013 Women are less likely to develop severe acute COVID but more likely to develop long COVID than men.[21] Some research suggests this is due primarily to hormonal differences,[87][88] while other research points to other factors, including chromosomal genetics, sex-dependent differences in immune system behavior, and non-biological factors may be relevant.[21]\n\nDiagnosis\n\nXenon MRI is being used to study long COVID, because it provides patients and physicians with explanations for previously unexplained observations. Xenon MRI can measure gas exchange and provide information on how much air is taken up by a patient's bloodstream, which is being researched in long-haul COVID patients.[89][90]\n\nXenon MRI can quantify three components of lung function: ventilation, barrier tissue uptake and gas exchange. Xenon-129 is soluble in pulmonary tissue, which allows the evaluation of lung functions such as perfusion and gas exchange (an advantage over helium). Ventilation measures how the air is distributed in the lung and can provide the locations of potentially compromised lung areas if no xenon reaches those areas. Barrier tissue uptake and gas exchange measure how much air diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Xenon MRI helps determine how well air is taken in by the lungs, absorbed into lung tissue, and taken up by the blood.[91][90]\n\nHealth system responses\n\nAustralia\n\nIn October 2020, a guide published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) says that ongoing post-COVID-19 infection symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain will require management by GPs, in addition to the more severe conditions already documented.[57]\n\nIn December 2021, research by a health economics expert at Deakin University suggests that even without fully understanding the Omicron variant's effects yet, a further 10,000 to 133,000 long COVID cases are likely to emerge on top of the current approximately 9450 in New South Wales and 19,800 in Victoria, after border and other restrictions had been recently lifted. The RACGP released new guidelines for general practitioners to manage a large number of new long COVID patients.[92]\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn October 2020, the DATCOV Hospital Surveillance Department of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) looked into a partnership with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) (an open-access research and data resource)[93] in order to conduct clinical research into the impact PASC may have within the South African context. As of 30 January 2021, the project has yet to receive ethical approval for the commencement of data collection. Ethics approval was granted on 3 February 2021 and formal data collection began on 8 February 2021.[citation needed]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn Britain, the National Health Service set up specialist clinics for the treatment of long COVID.[94] The four Chief Medical Officers of the UK were warned of academic concern over long COVID on 21 September 2020 in a letter written by Trisha Greenhalgh published in The BMJ[95] signed by academics including David Hunter, Martin McKee, Susan Michie, Melinda Mills, Christina Pagel, Stephen Reicher, Gabriel Scally, Devi Sridhar, Charles Tannock, Yee Whye Teh, and Harry Burns, former CMO for Scotland.[95]\n\nIn October 2020, NHS England's head Simon Stevens announced the NHS had committed \u00a310 million to be spent that year on setting up long COVID clinics to assess patients' physical, cognitive, and psychological conditions and to provide specialist treatment. Future clinical guidelines were announced, with further research on 10,000 patients planned and a designated task-force to be set up, along with an online rehabilitation service[96] \u2013 \"Your Covid Recovery\".[97] The clinics include a variety of medical professionals and therapists, with the aim of providing \"joined-up care for physical and mental health\".[54]\n\nThe National Institute for Health Research has allocated funding for research into the mechanisms behind symptoms of long COVID.[54][11]\n\nIn December 2020, University College London Hospitals (UCLH) opened a second long COVID clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery for patients with post-COVID neurological issues. The first clinic had opened in May, primarily focused on respiratory problems, but both clinics refer patients to other specialists where needed, including cardiologists, physiotherapists and psychiatrists.[98] By March 2021 there were 69 long COVID clinics in the English NHS, mostly focussing on assessing patients, with more planned to open. There were fears that community rehabilitation services did not have capacity to manage large numbers of referrals.[99]\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) published a guide to the management of long COVID.[100] The guideline was reviewed by representatives of the UK doctors #longcovid group, an online support group for COVID long-haulers, who said that it could be improved by introducing a more comprehensive description of the clinical features and physical nature of long COVID, among other changes.[101]\n\nIn November 2021 complaints were reported from NHS staff that neither their employers nor their trades unions were supportive, though the British Medical Association was pushing for long COVID to be classed as an occupational disease.[102]\n\nIn May 2022 demand for occupational therapy led rehabilitation services in Britain was reported to have increased by 82% over the previous six months as occupational therapists were supporting people whose needs have become more complex because of delays in treatment brought about by the pandemic. Half of occupational therapists surveyed were supporting people affected by lasting Covid symptoms.[103]\n\nUnited States\n\nThe physician Anthony S. Fauci has described long-term COVID-19 as \"a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive\", but also said that the number of cases is unknown.[104]\n\nOn 23 February 2021, the National Institutes of Health director, Francis Collins, announced a major initiative to identify the causes and ultimately the means of prevention and treatment of people who have long COVID.[25] Part of this initiative includes the creation of the COVID-19 Project,[105] which will gather data on neurological symptoms associated with PASC.\n\nOn 28 April 2021, the Subcommittee on Health of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing about long COVID.[106][107] In February 2022, it was announced that at least sixty-six hospitals and health systems had launched COVID recovery programs to aid patients who experience long term or lingering symptoms.[108]\n\nPublic response\n\nSome people experiencing long COVID have formed groups on social media sites.[109][110][111][112] There is an active international long COVID patient advocacy movement[113][114] which includes research led by patients themselves.[115][116] In many of these groups, individuals express frustration and their sense that their problems have been dismissed by medical professionals.[111][112]\n\nSpecial populations\n\nChildren\n\nA study from the Office for National Statistics with 20,000 participants, including children and adults, found that, in children who tested positive, at least one symptom persisted after five weeks in 9.8% of children aged two to eleven years and in 13% of children aged 12 to 16 years.[9] A 2022 University College London study in the UK, found that children ages 11\u201317 who had a positive PCR test for COVID were more likely to have three or more symptoms three months after their diagnosis compared to those with a negative test.[117] A study in Italy, which analyzed 129 children under the age of 18, examined health data obtained via a questionnaire between September 2020 and 1 January 2021. 53% of the group experienced COVID-19 symptoms more than 120 days after their diagnosis, and 43% were still impaired by the symptoms. Symptoms included insomnia, fatigue, muscle pain, chest tightness and pain, nasal congestion, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating.[118][119] A case report of five children in Sweden also reported symptoms (fatigue, heart palpitations, dyspnoea, headaches, muscle weakness and difficulty concentrating) persisting for 6\u20138 months after diagnosis.[55]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nNews"

        "text": "When many people dismiss COVID-19 as unworthy of needing a vaccine, they almost always ignore the effects of long COVID, the long-term symptoms and sequelae that tend to persist or appear after the typical convalescence period of COVID-19. And new peer-reviewed research shows that long COVID is associated with hair loss and sexual dysfunction \u2014 every male that sees this will be running as fast as they can to get the vaccine.\n\nBut on a more serious note, long COVID is linked to a lot of serious long-term consequences that are often dismissed by anti-vaccine and COVID-19 deniers.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at this new paper and review the results of their analysis. The basic result is that long COVID is scary.\n\nPhoto by Nathan Cowley on Pexels.com\n\nLong COVID paper\n\nIn a paper published on 25 July 2022 in Nature Medicine, Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar, MBBS, MPH, of the University of Birmingham in England, and colleagues found that 62 symptoms were significantly associated with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 486,149 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from January 2020 to April 2021 who were not hospitalized with an infection, and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in U.K primary care records. The researchers also assessed relative differences in 115 symptoms 12 weeks after people in the COVID group were infected.\n\nThe symptoms with the highest hazard ratios (HR):\n\nanosmia, loss of sense of smell (HR=6.49, or 6.49X higher risk than in a population without long COVID-19),\n\nhair loss (HR=3.99),\n\nsneezing (HR=2.77),\n\nejaculation difficulty (HR=2.63),\n\nreduced libido, or sex drive (HR=2.36),\n\nshortness of breath at rest (HR=2.20),\n\nfatigue (HR =.92),\n\npleuritic chest pain (HR=1.86),\n\nhoarse voice (HR=1.78)\n\nfever (HR=1.75)\n\nTwenty of the 62 reported symptoms in the paper were among the 33 symptoms listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition of long COVID. Overall, 5.4% of people with COVID and 4.3% of people without COVID reported at least one symptom included in the WHO case definition. The CDC also has a commonly used definition of long COVID.\n\nWomen had an increased risk of long COVID symptoms than men (HR=1.52). Furthermore, ages over 30 were associated with a higher risk of long COVID symptoms, but after adjusting for baseline covariates, people ages 30-39 had a 6% lower risk, and people ages 70 and older had a 25% lower risk than those aged 18-30 years. In other words, it appears that long COVID appears to target younger adults.\n\nHowever, there were other important risk factors for long COVID. Ethnic minority groups, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and other comorbidities have a statistically significant impact on the risk for long COVID.\n\nSummary\n\nLong COVID is a serious complication of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it seems to be ignored by a lot of the anti-vaccine crowd. They ignore the fact that long COVID is not only linked to minor symptoms like anosmia but is also linked to serious long-term diseases like type 2 diabetes. But if I have to stress hair loss and sexual dysfunction as sequelae of long COVID to convince recalcitrant males to get the vaccine, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\n\nBecause we know that the COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of long COVID.\n\nCitations\n\nSubramanian A, Nirantharakumar K, Hughes S, Myles P, Williams T, Gokhale KM, Taverner T, Chandan JS, Brown K, Simms-Williams N, Shah AD, Singh M, Kidy F, Okoth K, Hotham R, Bashir N, Cockburn N, Lee SI, Turner GM, Gkoutos GV, Aiyegbusi OL, McMullan C, Denniston AK, Sapey E, Lord JM, Wraith DC, Leggett E, Iles C, Marshall T, Price MJ, Marwaha S, Davies EH, Jackson LJ, Matthews KL, Camaradou J, Calvert M, Haroon S.

        "text": "This article about the settlement of a lawsuit and COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nHeadlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context.\n\nThree points need to be made:\n\nFirst, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption.\n\nSecond, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing.\n\nThird, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground.\n\nPhoto by cottonbro on Pexels.com\n\nBackground on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit\n\nApparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option.\n\nOut of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned.\n\nFourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context.\n\nLegal context\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before.\n\nBut for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains:\n\nGenerally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation.\n\nHowever, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show.\n\nIn short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions.\n\nIn addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule.\n\nAnd again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere.\n\nThis looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds.\n\nNot only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions.\n\nThis is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis.\n\nAs a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement.\n\nPhoto by Leon Seibert on Unsplash\n\nThe Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement\n\nThe settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts.\n\nFinancial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid).\n\nIn addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit.\n\nWork-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague.\n\nWhy did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming:\n\nInitially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "text": "Complete vaccination against COVID-19 was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke as secondary complications of a COVID-19 infection. These results were published in a peer-reviewed journal recently.\n\nThis is another huge benefit of COVID-19 vaccination that should be convincing evidence that the vaccine has both short- and long-term benefits.\n\nAs I usually do, I will review the study and results so that you can use this paper as further evidence that COVID-19 vaccination saves lives.\n\nPhoto by Jair L\u00e1zaro on Unsplash\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and reduced cardiovascular risks paper\n\nIn a research letter published on 22 July 2022 in JAMA, Jaehun Jung, MD, Ph.D., of Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea, and colleagues examined cardiovascular events in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis for the fully vaccinated compared with those not vaccinated. Jung and colleagues compared COVID-19 patients who were never vaccinated (n=62,727) to those who were fully vaccinated (n=168,310). They used nationwide data Korean nationwide COVID-19 registry and the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. COVID-19-19 reporting is mandated and universal health care coverage is in place in Korea.\n\nThe key results were:\n\nComposite of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke \u2014 adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.42, or a 58% reduction in risk for COVID-19 vaccinated versus unvaccinated.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction \u2014 adjusted HR = 0.48, or a 52% reduction in risk.\n\nIschemic stroke \u2014 adjusted HR = 0.40, or a 60% reduction in risk\n\nThe reduction in post-COVID myocardial infarctions and strokes among the fully vaccinated was observed across various subgroups. However, it did not reach statistical significance for people with a previous history of outcome events or those with severe or critical COVID-19.\n\nThese results are not different than another study that I previously discussed. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs before widespread vaccine availability, the researchers had estimated strokes from 30 days after infection as occurring at a rate of 4.03 per 1,000 people at 12 months; post-COVID myocardial infarctions were reported at 2.91 per 1,000 people at 12 months.\n\nIn the Korean data, the stroke rate in unvaccinated individuals was 4.59 per million person-days and the myocardial infarction rate was 1.60 per million person-days in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nSummary\n\nOnce again, there is robust and repeated evidence that the risk of long-term consequences of COVID-19 is reduced by COVID-19 vaccination. These vaccines are safe and effective, and they prevent cardiovascular events from COVID-19 such as heart attack and stroke. If this doesn\u2019t convince you to get the vaccine, I\u2019m running out of ideas.\n\nGet the vaccine, it saves your life.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "text": "Across the internet, I keep reading about some relationships between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I\u2019ve written about it twice (here and here), but I have never seen reliable, robust, and repeated clinical trial data that supports a link between vitamin D levels or deficiencies and COVID-19.\n\nSo, I thought I would take a look at it once again, and see if there\u2019s anything there. I keep wondering if vitamin D is just another \u201cmiracle supplement\u201d that, once you scratch the surface of data, you find that there is actually nothing there.\n\nWhat we know or think we know about COVID-19 seems to change daily, partially because the disease caught us by surprise. But every day we seem to get new data that contradicts something we thought or adds to our knowledge of the disease. And sometimes both.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current data on vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nPhoto by ready made on Pexels.com\n\nWhat is vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids (it\u2019s a scientific name for steroids with a \u201cbroken\u201d ring). The most important chemicals in this group are vitamin D 3 (known as cholecalciferol) and D 2 (known as ergocalciferol).\n\nGenerally, when we measure vitamin D levels in the blood, we measure calcifediol (also written as 25(OH)D), which is a form of vitamin D produced in the liver by the hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.\n\nVery few foods contain either of the important types of vitamin D. However, some foods can be good sources of the vitamin:\n\nFatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon\n\nFoods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals\n\nBeef liver\n\nCheese\n\nEgg yolks\n\nMany people with broad diets that include a lot of fish, eggs, and other foods can get sufficient vitamin D without supplementation. As I\u2019ve repeated often, short of chronic malnutrition, we get plenty of vitamin D.\n\nMoreover, vitamin D is produced by a process called dermal synthesis. That is, sunlight, specifically UV-B radiation, causes the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Technically, vitamin D isn\u2019t a vitamin, because we can manufacture it, it is a hormone. For this article, we\u2019ll just call it a vitamin, even though scientifically it is not.\n\nAlthough we can manufacture sufficient vitamin D by sunbathing every day, the body has a feedback loop that shuts down production to prevent toxicity. Yes, excess vitamin D is quite dangerous leading to many conditions such as over-absorption of calcium, from hypertension to fatigue. But it also can lead to some dangerous chronic conditions that we\u2019ll discuss later.\n\nAlthough humans can manufacture vitamin D by sitting in bright sun, there\u2019s one major problem \u2013 the risk of skin cancer. As I\u2019ve written before, there are very few ways to prevent cancer, but staying out of the sun is one of them.\n\nFinally, the vitamin D we consume or produce in sunlight is not biologically active. It is generally activated by enzymatic conversion (in a process called hydroxylation) in the kidneys and liver so that the body can use it.\n\nWhat does vitamin D do or don\u2019t do?\n\nBased on real scientific evidence, vitamin D has a very narrow, but important, set of effects.\n\nFirst, it is responsible for enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc, important minerals for the continued health of any human being. Many of these minerals (and vitamin D itself) are necessary for good bone health.\n\nSecond, since vitamin D is important to calcium homeostasis and metabolism, a deficiency of the vitamin results in rickets, or the adult form of the disease, osteomalacia. Rickets, because it happens in immature bones, leads to frequent fractures and skeletal deformities. Osteomalacia, because it occurs in adults with fully formed bones, usually only results in numerous fractures.\n\nAt this point, that\u2019s it. Robust evidence only supports those two physiological effects.\n\nHowever, here are a few claims made by the supplement-pushing crowd:\n\nDespite this utter lack of evidence, vitamin D has continued to be the panacea for all that ails humans. For those of us who only care about large, high-quality, peer-reviewed studies, vitamin D is overrated, unless you need to prevent rickets.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.com\n\nVitamin D and COVID-19 \u2014 clinical evidence\n\nAfter over two years of this pandemic, I assumed that there would be a lot of clinical evidence that would be published on the links (or lack thereof) between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I am not going to review every single clinical trial that\u2019s been published because that would take forever. I\u2019m going to focus on high-quality studies (specifically systematic reviews or meta-analyses, which are at the top of the hierarchy of medical research) if any are available.\n\nIn a systematic review published in June 2021, the researchers examined 31 peer-reviewed observational studies that examined potential links between COVID-19 and vitamin D. There results did not find any statistically significant associations between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. Many of the studies were of poor design or poor quality.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nWhile the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.\n\nAnother systematic review, published on 28 June 2021, showed a similar lack of association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. They examined five studies, which included a total of 467 patients (an incredibly small number), vitamin D levels were not linked to reduced mortality, reduced ICU admissions, and reduced requirements for ventilation.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nNo significant difference with vitamin-D supplementation on major health related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required addressing this topic.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 10 October 2020, the researchers were a bit more enthusiastic about vitamin D and COVID-19. The researchers analyzed six clinical studies. They found that patients with significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D had statistically higher risks of poorer COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe authors concluded that:\n\nSerum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients\u2019 potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 19 May 2021, researchers examined results from 532 patients in three separate studies. There appeared to be a statistically lower ICU requirement in those who received vitamin D supplementation compared to those that didn\u2019t.\n\nIn one more meta-analysis published on 23 September 2021, the researchers examined 21 studies that were found to be relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection/outcomes. This included 205,869 total patients. I would consider this to be the most robust of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews that I have examined.\n\nThe results of this meta-analysis were:\n\nIndividuals with low serum vitamin D levels were 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19.\n\nwere 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19. The researchers found that people with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L were 2.42X more likely to have severe COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that low vitamin D levels did not affect COVID-19 mortality.\n\nSummary\n\nSo what are our takeaways from all of this data?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit all over the place, though the final meta-analysis I reviewed seemed to provide good (but not great) evidence that supports the hypothesis that lower blood vitamin D levels may lead to worse outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nBut that leads to two important claims made about vitamin D:\n\nThere is no evidence vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 except when used as a supplement when someone has a known vitamin D deficiency. Megadoses of vitamin D can be dangerous and do not improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know why low vitamin D levels are linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It could be that individuals with low vitamin D levels have a lower immune response compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. And no, this does not mean that more vitamin D is going to miraculously boost your immune system so that COVID-19 will never strike. Get that out of your thinking immediately, because none of this evidence supports such a claim.\n\nAnd one more thing \u2014 we have zero evidence regarding vitamin D levels and outcomes from the new omicron variants. Maybe it\u2019s the same as COVID-19 in general, or maybe there\u2019s a difference. We will see.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "title": "Biotech Changed COVID; Did COVID Change Biotech?",
        "link": "https://www.bio.org/blogs/biotech-changed-covid-did-covid-change-biotech",
        "text": "COVID changed our world forever\u2014no one will forget the profound effect this modern pandemic has had on our everyday lives. Thankfully, we finally see the end of the pandemic, thanks in large part to the biotechnology industry. Without its immediate and tireless work to figure out what COVID-19 was, to develop therapeutics to treat it, and to finally find a way to protect against it with several vaccines, we might still be in dire straits today.\n\nBiotech definitively changed COVID, but did the virus change our industry? Today, we speak with experts about the lasting effect the pandemic has had on biotech and what changes we expect to see permanently.\n\nThe transmission and spread of COVID highlighted how intricately everything on the planet is connected\u2014the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real basics behind the One Health concept is that the health of people, the health of animals, and the health of our environment are inextricably linked. So, changes in one affect the others,\u201d explains Dr. William Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy at the Echo Health Alliance. \u201cOne Health brings that together \u2013 rather than saying that human health and animal health, environmental health are separate and can be addressed separately, they can\u2019t be addressed separately because they interact so much.\u201d\n\nWith that idea of connection and oneness comes a natural need for collaboration, which we saw first-hand in the fight against COVID-19. Cartier Esham, BIO\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, says \u201ccompanies jumped in because they wanted to help solve the global crisis\u2026It was their challenge to meet; and they did so.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd we are thankful they did.\n\nIt was truly an all-hands-on deck approach. Companies in the space pivoted from research projects to help. Aaron Sato, Chief Scientific Officer of Twist Bioscience, said that the company was able to provide scientific researchers at other biotech companies with synthetic versions of the virus to study which minimized their exposure risk. Helping other companies was not a fiscal decision, but a moral one.\n\nBecause of this collaboration for the public good, public opinion of the biotech industry has drastically improved. Ron Foshay of Service Research Insights says \u201cthe extraordinary effort made to develop safe and effective vaccines, one survey reported, shows that positive ratings of pharmaceutical companies went from 32% in early 2020 to 62% in early 2021. That\u2019s a really big jump.\u201d\n\nCollaboration and improved public opinion weren\u2019t the only good outcomes to come from battling COVID-19. Karesh highlights another \u2013 greater public understanding of the industry and clinical testing as a whole. And Esham hopes that the COVID-era change in clinical testing practices of bringing trials to patients will have a profound and beneficial impact on clinical trials of the future.\n\nBiotechnology has always been home to rapidly changing science, but COVID-19 fundamentally reshaped tenets of the industry in a way that will likely benefit more people.\n\nListen to the entire episode here.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies."

        "text": "Throughout 2021, there was a great deal of advances in the biotechnology sector in the United States \u2013 thanks, in part, to state-led and regional economic development initiatives which have created jobs, advanced educational opportunities, and championed innovation.\n\nAccording to the recently published report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and the Council of State Bioscience Associations (CSBA), \u201cDriving the Bioscience Economy Forward During the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d, state and regional initiatives ensured that the United States continues to be competitive in the global marketplace as a leader in the bioscience industry.\n\nThe purpose of the report is \u201cto help our partners out there \u2026 understand how we are a part of the larger ecosystem in a growing number of states,\u201d said Pete Pellerito, Senior Policy Adviser for Federal/State Economic Development & Technology Transfer Lead at BIO. \u201cThis report really reinforces the depth and the diversity of our geographic footprint in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can build all the new buildings we want, we can bring all the new equipment we want, have all the intellectual property in place, but if we don\u2019t have the people to drive it \u2026 [all] forward, any state, any region, is going to be at a disadvantage,\u201d Pellerito continued.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. bioscience industry employs 1.87 million people across more than 101,000 U.S. businesses.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how states are driving the bioscience economy.\n\nBiomanufacturing\n\nBiomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that leverages biological systems for the production of commercially vital biomolecules and biomaterials for medicines, food, and beverage processing as well as industrial use. State-level measures noted in the report to advance biomanufacturing include Ohio\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, which is a competitive grant program to encourage new advanced manufacturing project and service activity.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state\u2019s Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) provides hands-on education and training both in biomanufacturing methods as well as bioprocessing concepts. This training and education is in full compliance with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), a set of regulations published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, North Carolina provides both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) state matching grants as well as a manufacturing sales tax exemption on equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Connecticut has a Manufacturing Innovation Fund that offers worker training and apprenticeship programs, loans, grants, and vouchers. In addition, the state is aiming to support the creation of at least 15,000 new jobs over the next five years in advanced manufacturing, data science, and insurance technology.\n\nThe importance of public-private partnership\n\nPublic-private partnerships will continue to be key to the development of the bioscience industry in the United States.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Harvard and MIT came together in 2021 to start building a 40,000 square foot facility to create partnerships between the biopharmaceutical sector, academia, and medical leaders to advance the development of new treatment technologies for patients. The state government of Massachusetts is involved in this effort through the Massachusetts Life Science Center.\n\nOver in Tennessee, the state has directed $2.5 million of the state\u2019s budget during the 2021-2022 fiscal year towards the development of public-private partnerships to develop animal health drug products by working with universities, which have strong veterinary medicine and agricultural programs that study animal dermatological conditions and cancers.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the bioscience industry?\n\nAs the 2022 elections are approaching, Pellerito stated \u201cI have never felt that support for our industry has been partisan. I think it\u2019s very bipartisan.\u201d\n\nNo matter what the political winds have in store later this year, the biotech sector will continue to play an integral role in job creation and innovation across different states and regions, he said.\n\nWhen asked regarding what efforts are being made to advance opportunities for members of historically underrepresented communities across different states and regions, Pellerito pointed to BIO\u2019s BIOEquality Agenda, stating that increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the bioscience industry is of the utmost importance both to BIO members as well as to various academic partners.\n\nAs the report makes clear, despite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bioscience industry is in a strong position for continued growth. Ultimately, the success of the industry is dependent upon maintaining and expanding existing partnerships, all while creating new ones to further advance the opportunities that it provides in the communities it collaborates with and serves."

        "text": "It\u2019s been two years since COVID-19 was officially named a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it seems we are finally on the edge of moving from a pandemic to an endemic.\n\nBut what does this mean\u2014and what lessons can we take with us as we think about COVID-19 staying with us, or perhaps the next pandemic that may come sooner than we\u2019d like?\n\n\u201cYear 2 showed us that there's some durability to these vaccines,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, BIO\u2019s Vice President of Infectious Diseases & Emerging Science. \u201cYear 2 showed us that we can vaccinate at younger ages, and we found that heterologous boosting could actually lead to very interesting duration protection, which is a powerful thing scientifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing we learned in Year 2 was the power of activating messengers to talk to their specific community about vaccination is incredibly important and that that is what we need to be doing across all kinds of health care,\u201d continued Arthur. \u201cThe lack of understanding also opened the window for those who are anti-vaccine to actually take advantage of those misgivings. And people spread misinformation in communities that they weren't even a part of.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest vaccination campaign in American history\u2014but not everyone\u2019s on board. New #IamBIO Podcast episode features the voices of vaccine hesitancy and leaders building vaccine confidence, featuring @DrReedTuckson of the @BCAgainstCOVID. Listen: https://t.co/ckDrxBcU7R pic.twitter.com/OGqsUDZ7UQ \u2014 I Am Biotech (@IAmBiotech) April 20, 2021\n\n\u201cWhat does the end of the pandemic look like?\u201d asked Arthur. \u201cFor me, it's the stabilization of the incidence of disease and prevalence of the strains. That change is coming [\u2026] If you can literally, generally manage the number of people who are ill and hospitalized with existing medicine and have relatively controlled, or no, breakthroughs amongst people who are vaccinated, then we are kind of where the flu is.\u201d\n\nBut it is important to plan for the next pandemic now. \u201cEverybody wants to get on with the rest of their lives, and this is fine for the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the legislators and the administration needs to actually take the moment to step back and look at this and ask, what are the systems and safeguards I need to keep?\u201d\n\nWhy IP protection is critical to pandemic preparedness\n\nThe proposed waiver of IP for COVID vaccine technology could counteract future pandemic preparedness. While some have argued a waiver of the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would facilitate COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution, the exact opposite is true, experts told us.\n\nWe\u2019ll say it again: Waiving IP rights would compromise global vaccination efforts. \u201cThey argue that eliminating IP protections would allow any willing company to produce lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, making them cheaper and more widely accessible in low-income nations,\u201d BIO\u2019s Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath responded succinctly. \u201cIf true, that would be a compelling argument. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe problem with access is not so cut and dry, BIO\u2019s Senior Manager of International Affairs, Hillary Stiss, explains: \u201cIt is not an issue of IP that is preventing people from getting vaccines particularly in Africa. Really it is issues around African healthcare systems not being able to absorb vaccines and deliver it into arms.\u201d\n\nAs Hans Sauer, BIO\u2019s Deputy General Counsel and Vice President for Intellectual Property, further explained, there have been over 30 COVID vaccines developed\u2014not just the Pfizer, Modern, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines\u2014apparently without interference by anyone's patent rights. So, the idea that patents are getting in the way is incorrect.\n\nYet the very arguments used by governments to waive COVID IP rights seem to be a red herring to deflect from problematic global north government policy, while simultaneously disrespecting the work done by the private sector to step up and address this pandemic in record time \u2013 all with the added risk of disrupting investment, as well as R&D within biotech companies that would do absolutely nothing to help safeguard against the next big pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are certain folks who are willing to trade the next decades\u2019 innovation for access today as opposed to thinking of ways to manage access in a way that doesn't trade future innovation,\u201d noted Arthur.\n\n\u201cYou don't sell the rug out from under companies in order to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cCompanies' memories are actually quite long and if we have another pandemic and ask companies to help after forcing them to share their trade secrets they are going to resist.\n\nBiotech's Response to COVID-19, 2020-2022 Timeline\n\nYear 1"

        "text": "Analysis of \"We'll Have Herd Immunity by April\" Published in Wall Street Journal , by Marty Makary on\n\nThree scientists analysed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be very low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Cherry picking, Misleading, Overstates scientific confidence.\n\n2.2k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis Wall Street Journal opinion piece, published on 18 February 2021, claimed in its headline that the U.S. will \u201chave herd immunity by April\u201d. Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias/Fact Check.\n\nHerd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\n\u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d\n\nThe headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.]\n\nMarm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated.\n\nKilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population.\n\n\u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d\n\nThe article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population.\n\n\u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d\n\nIn short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded.\n\nApart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity.\n\nTara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2].\n\nVirologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d.\n\nEric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread:\n\nNo, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https://t.co/xkAQKU1hg6\n\n\u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity\n\n\u20142/3 of the US population has not had covid\n\n\u2014Wrong on T-cell protection\n\n\u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective\n\n\u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021\n\nWilliam Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading.\n\n\u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said.\n\nAs reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d\n\nCuriously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection.\n\nOne reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor.\n\n\u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said.\n\nCases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed.\n\nIn summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave.\n\nWhile the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants.\n\nMasks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021\n\nFormer director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d\n\nYou can read the original Wall Street Journal article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK\n\nA. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz:\n\nThe article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent).\n\n1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\n\n2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1].\n\nUsing the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims.\n\nThus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data.\n\nTara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University:\n\nThere are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2].\n\nWilliam Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health:\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\nThe estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000/million in Virginia, and about 300/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing.\n\nThere are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection.\n\nThe article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7].\n\nFinally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination.\n\nREFERENCES"

        "text": "CLAIM Lancet study showed that vaccinated people have lower immune function than unvaccinated people; COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Kenji Yamamoto, Tucker Carlson, Fox News, The Hodgetwins, 21 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Misrepresents source: The Lancet study cited in the video examined how COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. The study didn\u2019t examine immunity to infectious diseases in general nor did it find that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system.\n\nMisleading: The review article by Seneff et al. provided no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system. KEY TAKE AWAY No scientific evidence supports the claim that COVID-19 vaccination weakens the immune system. On the contrary, vaccination helps our immune system to better defend itself against infection. Large-scale clinical trials and scientific studies found that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines outweigh their risks.\n\nFULL CLAIM: A Lancet study \u201cshowed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals\u201d; \u201cit's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system\u201d\n\nREVIEW\n\nOn 21 July 2022, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that \u201cit\u2019s looking likely that [COVID-19] vaccines suppress the immune system\u201d. To support that assertion, Carlson cited a review article by Seneff et al. and a comment in Virology Journal by cardiologist Kenji Yamamoto. Carlson\u2019s news segment was shared by political commentators The Hodgetwins and cardiologist Peter McCullough, who previously made false claims about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Political commentator Ben Swann also made the same claim as Carlson in this video on Facebook, citing the same articles.\n\nThe claim isn\u2019t new; Health Feedback already debunked this claim here, here, and here. Claims like this illustrate how scientific publishing has proven to be an effective vehicle for spreading misinformation, by lending a sheen of credibility to inaccurate and misleading claims and narratives. This review will explain how this iteration of the claim by Carlson relies on speculations that lack scientific evidence as well as misrepresentations of a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet.\n\nArticle by Seneff et al. claiming that mRNA vaccines cause health problems like cancer is based on speculations that lack supporting evidence\n\nIn a review article, Seneff et al. claimed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could weaken the immune system through various biological pathways and increase the risk of infection and cancer. It should be noted that its lead author is Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has no training in infectious diseases or vaccines. Seneff has claimed that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been disproven by large-scale scientific studies which have thus far shown no association between vaccination and risk of autism.\n\nIn an email to Health Feedback, Angeline Rouers, a senior research fellow at the A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs in Singapore, stated that she found the review to be misleading and based on misinterpretation of scientific studies. The authors claimed that the innate immune response, in particular type I interferon, is suppressed because COVID-19 vaccines favor the adaptive immune response instead. However, the fact that COVID-19 vaccination promotes adaptive immunity as opposed to innate immunity isn\u2019t surprising.\n\n\u201cIt is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection,\u201d said Rouers. \u201cThe vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the promotion of adaptive immunity by COVID-19 vaccination doesn\u2019t imply the suppression of the innate immune system and \u201chas no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer,\u201d Rouers clarified. [See Rouers\u2019 full remarks here.]\n\nIndeed, a group of scientists, led by oncologist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Barriere, published a reply to the review, available on the OSF preprint server, also remarking on the same issue, among others.\n\nBarriere et al. wrote that the authors\u2019 claim about type I interferon impairment is based on a preprint[1] showing \u201ca differential gene expression profile in peripheral dendritic cells based on vaccinal status, but do not support the authors\u2019 claim that there is Type I IFN suppression due to the vaccine. Reliable research shows this is simply the reaction expected from a vaccine: a high immune response without a systemic and uncontrolled inflammation\u201d.\n\nJeffrey Morris, professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed the article by Seneff et al. in a Twitter thread. One of the most significant flaws in the article, he pointed out, is that it\u2019s primarily rooted in speculation. For instance, the authors suggested that mRNA vaccination is associated with diseases like herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, and optic neuropathy, even though there\u2019s no evidence that a link exists.\n\nThe article also claimed to present \u201cevidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health\u201d. While it did discuss several biological pathways, the authors didn\u2019t present evidence demonstrating that these pathways are actually affected by mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines,\u201d Morris said. Interestingly, he observed that much of the evidence cited was related to severe COVID-19, meaning that \u201cmuch content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination\u201d.\n\nThe authors sought to strengthen their claim about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines by citing reports from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). For example, the authors analyzed VAERS reports of anosmia (loss of smell) and concluded that it was a sign the vaccine caused nerve damage. However, as Morris pointed out, anosmia is common with COVID-19, whereas it isn\u2019t with vaccination. Therefore, these cases of anosmia could be explained by a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. But the authors ignored this possible explanation for their observation.\n\nIn support of their claim, the authors also cited the fact that VAERS reports related to COVID-19 vaccines made up the majority of reports for 2021 compared to other vaccines like the flu vaccine. However, they failed to account for differences in reporting rates between vaccines and the possibility that people are more likely to file VAERS reports after a COVID-19 vaccine than for other vaccines. A similar claim was addressed by Health Feedback here.\n\nBy analyzing VAERS reports of various \u201cnegative control events\u201d\u2014events we can safely exclude as being linked to vaccination\u2014such as toothache, limb X-rays, and alopecia (hair loss), Morris found that reporting for COVID-19 vaccines is indeed disproportionately higher than for other vaccines. For example, 97.2% of reports about toothache and 88.3% of reports about limb X-rays were filed after a COVID-19 vaccine. We have no reason to believe that COVID-19 vaccines cause toothache or limb X-rays, meaning that the large proportion of reports attributed to COVID-19 vaccines are the result of people being more likely to report adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, not because COVID-19 vaccines are harmful.\n\nOverall, the review presented a series of speculations about how mRNA vaccines might affect health\u2014all in favor of the narrative that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful\u2014but without presenting direct evidence that the changes they speculated would happen actually occur.\n\nAs Morris pointed out, the review at best provides \u201chypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven\u201d. Furthermore, the responsibility for validating these hypotheses lies with the authors themselves, as Morris pointed out, but instead the authors demanded for public health authorities to prove them wrong\u2014a typical example of shifting the burden of proof.\n\nComment by Yamamoto misrepresented the research and findings of a study in The Lancet by Nordstr\u00f6m et al.\n\nYamamoto\u2019s comment in Virology Journal, published in June 2022, claimed that a Lancet study, published in February 2022, showed \u201cimmune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. Yamamoto also went on to assert that \u201cAs a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued\u201d and that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients\u201d.\n\nHowever, this misrepresents the Lancet study performed by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. The study examined the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death up to nine months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose[2]. It reported that vaccine effectiveness decreased over time, meaning that the protection offered by the vaccines isn\u2019t permanent.\n\nIt also considered that its findings \u201c[strengthen] the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster, where the priority should be specific populations who are at higher risk of severe consequences of COVID-19 due to weaker and more rapidly waning vaccine-elicited immunogenicity\u201d. This is the complete opposite of Yamamoto\u2019s comment, which inaccurately extrapolated the findings of the study, which were related only to COVID-19, with infectious diseases in general.\n\nOther statements raise questions about the scientific credibility of Yamamoto\u2019s comment. In one example, he wrote that \u201cThe media have so far concealed the adverse events of vaccine administration, such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), owing to biased propaganda\u201d.\n\nThis is false; on the contrary, multiple mainstream media reports about VITT exist, like these by Reuters, the BBC, and the CBC, and have received much attention from both the scientific community and the public. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the risk of blood clots following COVID-19 is higher than after vaccination, as a study of more than 29.1 million people in the UK showed[3].\n\nYamamoto also claimed that \u201cIt has been hypothesized that there will be an increase in cardiovascular diseases, especially acute coronary syndromes, caused by the spike proteins in genetic vaccines\u201d. One of the scientific references he used to support this claim is an abstract by cardiothoracic surgeon Steven Gundry, which appeared in the medical journal Circulation in November 2021. An abstract is a brief summary of research findings, not a scientific study in itself.\n\nGundry\u2019s abstract received an Expression of Concern from the journal on 24 November 2021. The notice stated that \u201cthere is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used\u201d. In other words, no evidence was presented for the claims made in the abstract. But Yamamoto made no mention of the Expression of Concern or the problems with the abstract.\n\nWhile it is true that certain COVID-19 mRNA vaccines increase the risk of heart inflammation, in particular young men, the risk of heart inflammation and other health problems is much greater after getting COVID-19[4]. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that teenage boys were two to six times more likely to develop heart complications after COVID-19 than after vaccination, while the risk was seven to eight times higher in young men[5].\n\nOverall, the comment entirely misrepresented the findings of a Lancet study and emphasized the risks of COVID-19 vaccination while leaving out the fact that the risks associated with COVID-19 is much higher. It paints a misleading picture of the scientific state of understanding regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, the evidence shows that it is safer to get vaccinated than remain unvaccinated.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs:\n\nThe review by Seneff et al. is misleading and based on a misinterpretation of scientific data. The review is based on independent scientific evidence which are then combined to lead to a false conclusion: mRNA vaccines weaken innate immunity, particularly interferon (IFN) response.\n\nIt is known that type I IFN, which is part of the innate immune system, is particularly important in cancer. Mutations of IFN-related genes contribute to the development of cancer and IFN is a common therapy to treat tumor growth[6]. As for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, studies have shown that they instead favor the adaptive immune response (antibodies, memory T and B cells). Based on these observations, the authors of the review raised the concern that the innate immune response, particularly the IFN response, is suppressed following vaccination, in contrast to strong inflammation during infection.\n\nHowever, it is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection[1]. The vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection.\n\nIn the context of vaccination, promoting memory immune responses like B cells is the most important for antiviral immunity[7]. Innate responses have very limited memory and their stimulation via vaccination is less relevant.\n\nFurthermore, the limited IFN response following COVID-19 vaccination is not evidence of weakened immunity and has no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer. Thus, the claim that mRNA vaccines weaken the immune system isn\u2019t supported by scientific evidence.\n\nFinally, the comment by K. Yamamoto is another misinterpretation of a published study. His comment says: \u201cThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. However, the actual observation of this study is that immunity wanes after vaccination. We already know this and it is this waning that justifies the need for a booster shot. In addition, the study reported that the unvaccinated always have a higher incidence of infection compared to vaccinated. In general, studies support the use of vaccine boosters to reduce the risk of hospitalization, even against Omicron[8].\n\nUPDATE (4 August 2022):\n\nThe review was updated to include an iteration of the claim by Ben Swann.\n\nUPDATE (29 July 2022):\n\nDr. Rouers\u2019 comment was received and included after the initial publication. This comment further supports the original verdict and did not modify it. A reference to the letter by Barriere et al. was also added to the review.\n\nREFERENCES"

Therefore, such rates don't necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness.\n\nUnsupported: Studies so far have shown that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are ineffective at treating or preventing COVID-19. KEY TAKE AWAY Studies show that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t alter people\u2019s DNA. No reliable scientific evidence shows that hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin cure COVID-19.\n\nFULL CLAIM: \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID\u201d; \u201cWhy aren't they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d; \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nREVIEW\n\nOn 17 July 2022, political activist Charlie Kirk published a video on Facebook, claiming that Canadian data showed COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of death from COVID-19. The video was viewed more than 720,000 times and shared more than 21,000 times. Kirk also rehashed old, inaccurate, and misleading claims that COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19, which have already been debunked by fact-checkers before, as we will show below.\n\nClaim 1 (Incorrect): \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID.\u201d\n\nKirk cited an article by journalist Alex Berenson to support this claim. Berenson, who made multiple inaccurate and misleading claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, claimed in a Substack article that data from the Manitoban government showed that, vaccinated people \u201cwere about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die of Covid than unvaccinated people\u201d in May 2022. Below is the graph referenced by Berenson.\n\n\n\nThe age-standardized rate of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths associated with COVID-19 in Manitoba for April (top) and May (bottom) 2022. Note how the trends in April contrast with those in May.\n\nWhile the data presented here accounted for differences in risk due to age\u2014which is important because severe COVID-19 is associated with advanced age\u2014 the difference in the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and the amount of time a person spent in each vaccination status, there are other important factors that remain unaccounted for. For example, people with preexisting health conditions that increase their risk of severe COVID-19 are more likely to be overrepresented among vaccinated people. This, along with differences in infection levels, different variants, and differing levels in immunity from prior infection, mean that age-standardized rates don\u2019t necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness, as the UK Office of National Statistics cautioned:\n\n\u201cThe [age-standardized mortality rates] give the age-adjusted risk of death for the people in the different vaccination status groups. Estimating vaccine effectiveness is challenging when vaccination status is not allocated at random, as factors that vary between the vaccination status groups and over time need to be accounted for to determine the causal impact of vaccines on mortality.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the data showed a different trend in April 2022, just a month before the one that Berenson used, indicating a lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths in both the vaccinated and the people who received a booster dose. Therefore, Berenson may have cherry-picked data that supported the narrative he wished to present and left out data that conflicted with his narrative.\n\nIf the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, as Berenson and Kirk claimed, we would expect to see the same or even more pronounced trend in people who received a booster dose (the blue bar in the graph), since these people received the most doses among the three groups. However, the rate of death in people who received a booster dose is the same as in unvaccinated people, not higher. Berenson himself was aware of this, as he wrote: \u201cPeople who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated\u201d. Nevertheless, he went on to claim that the \u201cdata show vaccines now RAISE the risk of death from Covid\u201d, which is demonstrably false.\n\nData for the whole of Canada\u2014which provides a larger sample size than just Manitoba alone\u2014also contradict Berenson\u2019s claim. Health Canada reported that from 9 May to 5 June 2022, \u201cunvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series. During the same 4-week period, unvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 6 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series and 1 or more additional doses\u201d.\n\nLarge-scale studies support this observation, finding that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death. Indeed, a modeling study published in The Lancet Infectious Disease estimated that COVID-19 vaccination saved tens of millions of lives globally[1]. While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has dampened vaccine effectiveness against disease[2,3], getting vaccinated remains safer than not getting vaccinated.\n\nClaim 2 (Misrepresents source): \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nAs evidence for this claim, Kirk highlighted a Fox News segment from 12 July 2022, in which Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, said:\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s clear from the data [is] that even though vaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well, as it were, against infection, they protect quite well against severe disease leading to hospitalization and death.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kirk only presented the part where Fauci said that \u201cvaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well\u201d, leaving out the rest in which he clarified that COVID-19 vaccines are still effective at keeping people from becoming seriously ill and dying. By doing so, Kirk distorted the meaning of Fauci\u2019s words.\n\nClaim 3 (Factually inaccurate): COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d\n\nThis old claim is false and has been refuted many times. As explained in numerous fact-checks, the COVID-19 vaccines cannot alter our DNA. The mRNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are unable to directly integrate into our DNA, because RNA is chemically different from DNA.\n\nNevertheless, some continued to propagate this false claim through various means, such as by citing an inaccurate Forbes article headline or a study by Lund University, which allegedly showed that RNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reverse-transcribed, or converted into DNA, and entered the cells. The study set out to determine if mRNA from the vaccine was reverse-transcribed and if so, whether the resulting DNA entered the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is stored. The experiments were conducted in human liver cells originating from a hepatocarcinoma (liver cancer). As this Health Feedback review explained, the experiments didn\u2019t show that vaccine mRNA was reverse-transcribed or that foreign DNA entered the nucleus of the cells, much less integrate into cell DNA.\n\nClaim 4 (Unsupported): \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d\n\nEarly in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin were touted by some as preventative and curative medicine for COVID-19. However, there is no reliable scientific evidence to support this claim. As we reported in previous Health Feedback reviews, large-scale randomized controlled trials, including those conducted by the University of Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, didn\u2019t find any of these drugs to be effective at reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19[4-7].\n\nREFERENCES"

        "text": "Three scientists analyzed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading.\n\n1.3k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis Washington Times opinion piece, published on 5 August 2021, made multiple claims about the evolution of virus variants, immune escape, as well as COVID-19 vaccine safety. Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nMalone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable.\n\nThe key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.]\n\nExperts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.]\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d\n\nEmma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument.\n\n\u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d\n\nIndeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination.\n\nIn addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d\n\nFisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nSome of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said.\n\nAll three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said.\n\nScientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for.\n\nBut even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations.\n\nOn the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible.\n\nYou can read the original Washington Times article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK:\n\nEmma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel:\n\nI will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this.\n\nViruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease.\n\nFor most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms.\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes.\n\nWe see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\nThus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both.\n\nWhat\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination.\n\nFinally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation.\n\nIn short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination.\n\nFinally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected).\n\nExposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent.\n\nDale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore:\n\nThis article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO.\n\nFlawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission.\n\nFlawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies.\n\nFlawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\n\nFlawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice.\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs:\n\nThe article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place:\n\nAbout assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\n\nSome of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it!\n\nAbout assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links.\n\nIt is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination.\n\nAbout assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity.\n\nANNOTATIONS\n\nThe statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity).\n\n\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does, that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\n\u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201c\n\nIn fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected)."

        "link": "https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/herpes-shingles-vzv-chicken-pox-alzheimers-disease/",
        "text": "A fascinating new collaborative study, between researchers at the University of Oxford and Tufts University, has found two common viruses may be working in tandem to trigger the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The findings build on a growing body of evidence implicating the herpes virus in neurodegenerative disease.\n\nFor over half a century the idea that microbial infections are a trigger for neurodegenerative disease has been floating on the sidelines of neuroscience. In the 1980s a number of studies pointed to associations between the onset of Alzheimer's disease and herpes simplex viral infections, but exactly how this very common virus could be influencing neurodegeneration was not clear.\n\nA key 2020 study from a Tufts University team demonstrated exactly how a herpes infection could induce several pathological features of Alzheimer\u2019s. The study used a new kind of 3D bioengineered brain model that populated a sponge-like structure with neural stem cells that could be coaxed into a variety of brain cells.\n\nThis type of brain tissue model was incredibly novel, and the findings were the first to explicitly show how the common viral infection can lead to pathological signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. But a big question hovered over the findings. Considering more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s population carry herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), there must be other factors that reactivate the dormant virus and trigger this cascade of events that lead to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThis new study looked to another common virus that has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 varicella zoster virus (VZV). This virus causes chicken pox and, in later life, shingles. So using the 3D bioengineered brain model the researchers looked at whether VZV infection influences brain cells already seeded with dormant herpesvirus.\n\nInterestingly, the research found exposing brain cells harboring dormant HSV-1 to VZV led to a reactivation of the herpesvirus and a cascade of the toxic plaques known to be signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. However, all of these Alzheimer\u2019s signs did not appear when brain cells were exposed to VZV in the absence of herpesvirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-two punch of two viruses that are very common and usually harmless, but the lab studies suggest that if a new exposure to VZV wakes up dormant HSV-1, they could cause trouble,\u201d said Dana Cairns, a researcher working on the project.\n\nWhile the study does confidently propose this two-pronged viral mechanism can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it does make clear this is likely only one pathway among many. And if reactivating dormant HSV-1 can trigger the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, there are probably a number of ways this can occur beyond an exposure to VZV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still possible that other infections and other pathways of cause and effect could lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and risk factors such as head trauma, obesity, or alcohol consumption suggest they may intersect at the re-emergence of HSV in the brain,\u201d added Cairns.\n\nThe study also speculates potential future Alzheimer\u2019s problems may arise from the COVID-19 pandemic as SARS-CoV-2 infections have been known to reactivate dormant VSV and HSV-1 infections. It has been suggested the pandemic could increase future rates of neurodegenerative disease and the researchers behind this new study urge clinicians to keep a watchful eye on elderly patients over the coming years.\n\nThe new study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\nSource: Tufts University"

        "link": "https://newatlas.com/energy/blowhole-wave-energy-generator/",
        "text": "Wave Swell Energy's remarkable UniWave 200 is a sea platform that uses an artificial blowhole formation to create air pressure changes that drive a turbine and feed energy back to shore. After a year of testing, the company reports excellent results.\n\nAs we've discussed before, the UniWave system is a floatable device that can be towed to any coastal location and connected to the local energy grid. It's designed so that wave swells force water into a specially designed concrete chamber, pressurizing the air in the chamber and forcing it through an outlet valve. Then as the water recedes, it generates a powerful vacuum, which sucks air in through a turbine at the top and generates electricity that's fed into the grid via a cable.\n\nAs a result, it draws energy from the entire column of water that enters its chamber, a fact the team says makes it more efficient than wave energy devices that only harvest energy from the surface or the sea floor.\n\nThe UniWave 200 in place off King Island, Tasmania Wave Swell Energy\n\nWSE's key innovation here is that one-way generation; other devices that harvest the same effect use bi-directional turbines, requiring the ability to reverse blade pitch or redirect the airflow. WSE says its design allows for far cheaper and simpler turbines, that should also last longer since they're not getting as much salt water splashed through them when a big wave hits. Indeed, all this device's moving parts are above the waterline, a fact that should help extend its service life as well as making it completely harmless to marine life.\n\nInterestingly, the UniWave's design also makes it easy to incorporate into breakwaters and seawalls, where it can take a coastal erosion protection project and turn it into a clean energy source. You can see an animation showing how it works in the video below.\n\nWSE Technology and King Island Project\n\nA 200-kW test platform was installed last year off King Island, facing the notoriously rough seas of Bass Strait, which separates the island state of Tasmania from the mainland of Australia. There, it's been contributing reliable clean energy to the island's microgrid around the clock for a full 12 months. The WSE team has made a few live tweaks to the design during operation, improving its performance beyond original expectations.\n\n\u201cWe set out to prove that Wave Swell\u2019s wave energy converter technology could supply electricity to a grid in a range of wave conditions, and we have done that,\u201d said WSE CEO Paul Geason in a press release. \"One key achievement has been to deliver real-world results in Tasmanian ocean conditions to complement the AMC test modeling. In some instances, the performance of our technology in the ocean has exceeded expectations due to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt through the project, technological improvements and the refinements we have made over the course of the year.\"\n\n\"Our team is excited to have achieved a rate of conversion from wave power to electricity at an average of 45 to 50% in a wide range of wave conditions,\" he continues. \"This is a vast improvement on past devices and shows that the moment has arrived for wave power to sit alongside wind, solar and energy storage as part of a modern energy mix.\"\n\nWe asked Geason over email how much energy the device generated during the trial. \"It's important to stress that the demonstration at King Island was not about producing high volumes of electricity,\" he responds. \"Rather, it was to prove the capabilities of our technology in a variety of wave conditions. The results have met and at times exceeded our expectations. As an example, when the unit is generating 40 kW of power in reasonable wave conditions, you could extrapolate the amount of energy to be in the order of 1MWh in a 24 hour period.\"\n\nThe UniWave can turn erosion protection projects into clean power sources Wave Swell Energy\n\nThe King Island platform will remain in place at least until the end of 2022, and the company is now gearing up to go into production.\n\n\"Having proven our device can survive the toughest conditions the Southern Ocean and Bass Strait can throw at it, and deliver grid compliant electricity, our priority now shifts to commercializing the technology,\" said Gleason. \"For Wave Swell this means ensuring the market embraces the WSE technology and units are deployed to deliver utility scale clean electricity to mainland grids around the world.\u201d\n\nGeason tells New Atlas that commercial deployments could vary in size. \"The units can scale up from 200 kW,\" he writes. \"Exact size will depend upon the attributes of the wave climate at any particular location. The sweet spot, as you put it, will be site dependent. We're currently engaged with a number of third parties that are seeking to deploy commercial units, and our efforts and resources are focused on further deployments and commercialization of our technology.\"\n\nSee the UniWave 200 test platform running in the video below.\n\nWaveSwell PowerUp\n\nSource: Wave Swell Energy\n\nEditor's note: this piece has been updated on August 2, to include responses from our communications with WSE CEO Paul Gleason."

        "link": "https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/n95-flo-mask-reusable-elastomeric-respirator/",
        "text": "Remember when everyone was experimenting with different kinds of cloth face mask designs back in 2020? For many, the frustration of mask wearing could be offset by the creative ways cloth masks were decoratively deployed.\n\nAs the pandemic wore on, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged and we learned more about how this novel virus spread. Cloth masks simply weren\u2019t enough, so many people shifted to using surgical masks. But soon it became clear they weren\u2019t that effective either. In a world permanently changed by the emergence of the stunningly infectious Omicron variant, well-fitted N95 masks became the only real option for those seeking good protection from this airborne virus.\n\nNow it\u2019s 2022, and you could be forgiven for pausing a moment before you put in an order for yet another box of disposable N95 masks. There has to be a more efficient way. This virus is not going to suddenly disappear, so is the future going to be an endless cycle of buying and dumping disposable masks?\n\nThe accumulating waste problem from disposable masks is nothing short of catastrophic. Not only are hundreds of millions of face masks disposed of every single day, but the plastic fibers in the masks are adding to a frightening microplastic problem. One recent study found masks can easily leach plastics into waterways.\n\nThe solution seems simple \u2013 reusable face masks. And they do already exist. They are known as elastomeric respirators, and most of us are probably familiar with their two-chambered gas mask aesthetic. They certainly don\u2019t look elegant, and have never really taken off in health care contexts.\n\nBut traditional elastomeric respirators look the way they do because of fundamental technological limitations. To make a respirator with 95 to 99% filtration, you need a fair bit of surface area. Every time you inhale, all the air coming in needs to move through a thick filter, so the bigger the surface area the less a wearer feels like they are trying to pull each breath through a thick cloth.\n\nCurrent elastomeric respirators are big, bulky, and aesthetically imposing Depositphotos\n\nCan there be a better way?\n\nThis is exactly what Flo Mask creator Kevin Ngo wondered all the way back in 2018. Devastating wildfires that year led to his neighborhood in the San Francisco Bay Area being blanketed with toxic smoke for several weeks. He quickly whipped on a N95 but struggled to find something that worked well for his children.\n\n\u201cAnd that's when I said, 'you know what, there's got to be a solution out there, I make products for a living, I'm gonna find the best mask that they make for kids,'\u201d Ngo explains in an interview with New Atlas. \u201cBecause I'm wearing an N95 to work, and if I'm already getting headaches, my eyes are burning and tearing up from all the wildfires smoke, I can only imagine what, you know, a kindergartener or third grader\u2019s feeling at the time.\u201d\n\nThe kids' Flo Mask took two years to develop Flo Mask\n\nNgo is your classic Silicon Valley geek. For the better part of 20 years he has worked in product development for everyone from Logitech to Motorola. He currently works at Google, and after a frustrating evening in 2018 searching all over the internet for a good kids' mask he realized what he needed simply didn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo what does a Silicon Valley tech guy do when he realizes what he needs doesn\u2019t exist? He gets a bunch of friends, all award-winning product designers, and spends two years developing the best kids mask they can imagine. Ngo called in favors from all over the tech world as he tinkered with the designs for a kids' mask. Every step of the way he came across other parents willing to help out to make this thing a reality \u2013 from wrangling weekend use of one of the most advanced 3D scanners in the world to scan dozens of child faces, to leveraging silicone mold knowledge from designers on the team familiar with popular commercial products.\n\nKevin Ngo, the creator of the Flo Mask Flo Mask\n\nAnd then \u2026 2020\n\nThe pandemic hit just as Ngo was at the tail end of his first kids' Flo Mask development. By the end of 2020, the kids' Flo Mask was out but the world of pandemic masks still hadn\u2019t caught up to where Ngo was. His perfectly sealed elastomeric masks seemed overkill in a world playing around with cloth and surgical masks.\n\nAs time passed, demand grew for an adult iteration of the Flo Mask. The problem was an adult mask is a much more complicated design challenge. Kids' faces are relatively uniform, so getting close to a one-size-fits-all design wasn\u2019t too hard. Plus, new kinds of filters would be needed for adult masks to get up above the 95% efficiency expected by people currently wearing N95 masks.\n\nThe big eureka moment, according to Ngo, came when he learned a next-generation filter material had been developed in late 2019. Initially, the material was only being used by the Department of Defense but due to a random confluence of events, Ngo got his hands on a load and went about testing its efficiency.\n\nThe results were the game changer he needed to create the adult mask. Testing the material revealed it had the ability to filter with 99% efficiency over a tiny surface area while maintaining extraordinary breathability.\n\n\u201cSo if you think about the science of masks, the machine [that tests filter efficiency] uses a surface area of 100 centimeters squared,\u201d Ngo explained. \u201cIn order to hit N95 the masks they test covers up almost 100 centimeters squared. So filtration surface area correlates to how high the efficiency is. You're getting about 95%, or better, at 100 centimeters squared. The filter for flow mask, it's 57 centimeters squared, so almost half the size, but we're still getting 99% filtration, with equivalent breathability of an N95, if not better. So this is next level stuff. And that's how we're able to achieve what we've achieved.\u201d\n\nDesigning a mask to fit a variety of adult face shapes was a major challenge Flo Mask\n\nThe face challenge\n\nThe other big challenge for designing the adult Flo lay in trying to accommodate the breadth of adult face shapes. Again, the team looked at a mass of 3D face scans and came up with two design iterations based on nose bridge size \u2013 a low to medium size for people of Asian and African decent, and a medium to high nose bridge size for those of European descent.\n\nNgo calculated between these two sizes, around 90% of all adults should be accommodated by the Flo Mask. But now the mask is out in the real world it's turning out 90% was an underestimate.\n\n\u201cWe have a success rate of 98% which is pretty phenomenal,\u201d Ngo explained, after the company has now been shipping masks out to customers for a few months. \u201cConsidering we felt like, you know, we could get nine out of 10 users in our mask, of the users who have bought we're getting 98%, which is like pretty spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe adult Flo Mask went through over a dozen different design iterations before its final version arrived Flo Mask\n\nAll in all, the mask went through at least a dozen design iterations before the final version was settled upon. From painstaking work getting a glass indentation perfectly placed in the silicone mold, to working out the optimal way for the filters to sit over the mask, the attention to detail in the Flo Mask is impressive.\n\nNevertheless, there are still challenges ahead, particularly in navigating the slow bureaucracy of N95 certification. For a mask like this to be formally certified as N95 or higher in the United States it needs to go through an organization called NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health), which Ngo said may take some time.\n\nBut the Flo Mask has been selected to be a finalist in a Mask Innovation Moonshot Challenge, spearheaded by several US government agencies including NIOSH, BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).\n\nIn the spirit of absolute transparency, Ngo makes no claims to Flo Mask being equivalent to an authorized N95. However, as part of the Mask Innovation Challenge, the Flo Mask has been through NIOSH\u2019s testing protocol and those results have been published on YouTube.\n\nFlo Mask Pro - NIOSH & NIST Tests\n\nWhy are we still using disposable masks?\n\nTrying on the Flo Mask for the first time was a pretty eye-opening experience. After battling ill-fitting, tight, uncomfortable, disposable N95 masks for months, the Flo's silicone gasket instantly created a surprisingly good seal. The filter was easy to breathe through and my voice wasn\u2019t muffled at all talking through it.\n\nThe only slightly unusual aspect was the way the mask is designed to sit above my chin. Two years of wearing various masks that sit under my chin meant it certainly took a few moments to adjust to the very unique way the Flo Mask sits on the face.\n\nAfter a few days of using the Flo Mask I was left with one big question: Why aren\u2019t these kinds of elastomeric respirators widely used? Sure, the imposing qualities of older two-chamber respirators may have presented an unfavorable aesthetic for health care environments in the past, but that\u2019s not a problem anymore.\n\nA recent New York Times investigation into elastomeric masks had one major researcher describing the lack of adoption in health care contexts as puzzling. Emily Haas, a scientist working for NIOSH, suggested the biggest challenge in moving hospitals from disposable N95s to reusable respirators is cultural. These health care environments have for decades used disposable masks and changing that norm will take work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much research in the last 10 years that has really supported elastomerics, so in some ways the issue right now is cultural,\u201d Haas said. \u201cNo one likes change, and introducing a whole new system of respiratory protection can be a heavy lift.\u201d\n\nThe US-government-led Mask Innovation Challenge seems to be part of an attempt to change these old behaviors. And Flo Mask is certainly one of the Challenge\u2019s finalists with the potential to radically alter the way we think about masks.\n\nBut right now, Flo Mask is still a labor of love for Ngo. Talking to New Atlas at 10 pm on a weeknight, after a day\u2019s work at Google and an evening spent with his kids, it\u2019s clear the years of work put into the Flo Mask have been all done in his spare time with thousands of dollars of personal savings on the line. And so far, the business is still run mostly by him, responding to emails from customers at midnight in between family life and a day job.\n\nToday in testing the @flo_mask Pro:\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Used the Everyday Filter & inhaling feels fine. No odd plasticky smells. Feels quite cool underneath w/o air leaks on exhalation.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Unlike w/ N95s, it doesn't get dislodged while speaking. Chin is free!\n\n1/\ud83e\uddf5 #COVIDisAirborne #CovidIsNotOver pic.twitter.com/cpPzILecZp \u2014 \u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30ab\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca #COVIDisAirborne (Mask-o-genic era) \u2b50\ud83e\udde3 (@paulakatarina) July 16, 2022\n\nNgo is justifiably proud of what he has created, and for a product that entered the world with zero marketing it\u2019s slowly snowballing via word-of-mouth as social media channels light up with constant streams of positive user reports. Scrolling through Flo's Twitter account delivers a torrent of people sharing images of themselves proudly wearing the mask after somehow finding out about the Flo.\n\n\u201cI don't claim to know everything, but I've learned a lot [while developing the Flo Mask],\u201d said Ngo. \u201cAnd I feel like this is hands down the best mask anyone's ever made. Because we're taking these ginormous respirator elastomerics that you've seen for decades, and we've taken it to a size that is unheard of, with the same level of protection or almost equivalent. And, you know, it's kind of weird that a few tech guys who love making products happen to have built the best mask in the world.\u201d"

        "text": "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "text": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower.

It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

        "text": "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter."

        "link": "https://thelogicofscience.com/2022/01/19/debunking-30-bad-arguments-about-covid-vaccines/",
        "text": "The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place.\n\nThis article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence.\n\nMany of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories:\n\n1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk/mortality rates\n\n9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines\n\n14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness\n\n21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science\n\n24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s do this.\n\nBad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous\n\nReality: Yes it is; millions are dead\n\nOver 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nBad argument #2: 99.9% survive\n\nReality: That still means millions of deaths\n\nThe survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities.\n\nReality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID\n\nComorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions).\n\nMore details here.\n\nBad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu\n\nReality: Yes it is\n\nIn the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu.\n\nBad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine\n\nReality: You can still become seriously ill and/or spread it to others\n\nBeing young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #).\n\nAlso see #25\n\nBad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines\n\nReality: Your immune system is only as good as its training\n\nEven a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d\n\nDetails here\n\nBad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines\n\nReality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died.\n\nHomo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t\n\nReality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous\n\nEarly evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations.\n\nBad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA\n\nReality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering.\n\nDNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #10: The vaccines are too new/rushed\n\nReality: No, they aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects\n\nReality: Yes, we do\n\nNo vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will.\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine\n\nReality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing\n\nAgain, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies.\n\nBad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated\n\nReality: They are safer with vaccines\n\nHospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022).\n\nIn contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022).\n\nBad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective\n\nReality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful\n\nThis one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16).\n\nMore details here and here.\n\nBad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases)\n\nReality: They reduce risk and severity\n\nAgain, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)!\n\nThis argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs.\n\nUpdate 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine.\n\nBad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID\n\nReality: They reduce risk of transmission\n\nVaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you.\n\nBad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated\n\nReality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers\n\nThis claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15).\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron\n\nReality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness\n\nOmicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021).\n\nSee #20 on boosters\n\nBad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated?\n\nReality: Because I care about others\n\nVaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc.\n\nBad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three\n\nReality: So what? Why is that a problem?\n\nBad argument #21: But science has been wrong before\n\nReality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works\n\nScience is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines.\n\nDetails here and here.\n\nAlso, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus\n\nReality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right\n\nGalileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21).\n\nDetails here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe\n\nReality: No there wasn\u2019t\n\nThis is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22).\n\nSee posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies/It\u2019s all about money\n\nReality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other\n\nSee posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument.\n\nBad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes]\n\nReality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science\n\nThe fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation.\n\nAdditionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet.\n\nMore details here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS\n\nReality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem\n\nVAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25).\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines\n\nReality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks\n\nAdverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021).\n\nSee studies cited in #10, 13\u201316\n\nBad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories/FDA corruption\n\nReality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd.\n\nBad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates\n\nReality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health\n\nThis is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers).\n\nBad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026\n\nReality: Those are not good sources\n\nPlease just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.\n\nMore on fact checking\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "link": "https://thelogicofscience.com/2021/07/27/the-99-survive-covid-argument-is-deceptive-and-completely-misses-the-point/",
        "text": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

        "text": "I\u2019ve been a fan of Jon Stewart for a long time. I usually find him to be both funny and insightful. It was, therefore, with great dismay that I watched him spread a conspiracy theory and inaccuracies about science on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and I regret that it is now my duty to explain his errors.\n\nIn the clip, which you can see here, Stewart begins by saying that we owe a great debt to science for helping to ameliorate the COVID19 crisis. That much I absolutely agree with. Scientists deserve an enormous amount of gratitude for developing the vaccines that are currently saving lives and reducing suffering around the world. Unfortunately, the interview quickly took a turn for a worse as Stewart endorsed the conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID19 escaped from the lab in Wuhan and made numerous dangerous, false statements about how scientists operate.\n\nMischaracterizations of science and scientists\n\nBefore I get to the conspiracy theory, I want to respond to a more general comment he made which really bothered me, because it is a common and damaging misconception about science and scientists. He said,\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with science. Science is incredible, but they don\u2019t know where to stop, and nobody in the room with those cats ever goes, \u2018ya know, I don\u2019t know if we should do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is an inherently untrue statement that is, unfortunately, a very common misconception about science, perhaps most famously stated by Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park as, \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d\n\nIn reality, most of us scientists spend a great deal of time thinking about the implications of our work and whether it is a good idea, and even if we didn\u2019t want to do that, we are forced to do that by ethics committees. The days of \u201cmad scientists\u201d operating in isolation doing dangerous, unethical experiments are long gone. In modern science, you have to submit proposals before you do research, and those proposals get reviewed by ethics boards (which, btw, usually include scientists and non-scientists) who will approve, reject, or insist on modifications to your proposal. If you get approved, you then have to submit reports on what you actually did, and there are usually audits. Further, if you want to work with something dangerous, you often need additional government clearance and approval. Things are checked and regulated, particularly in a major lab like the one in Wuhan.\n\nIndeed, Stewart went on to give an example that undercut his whole argument. In a deranged monologue in which he asserted (I hope jokingly) that scientists would be the death of humanity, he inaccurately described scientists\u2019 re-animation of the virus that caused the 1918 flu,\n\n\u201cThey had a little sample of [the virus], and it hadn\u2019t been a scourge in the earth for 100 years, and they thought to themselves, \u2018what if we just, I don\u2019t know, woke it up?\u2019 And nobody in the room was like, \u2018No. Let\u2019s not do that.'\u201d\n\nThe reality of the situation was quite different. The research was conducted by the CDC and went through both an Institutional Biosafety Committee review and an Animal Care and Use Committee review before being conducted. The risks and benefits were carefully thought out, evaluated, and discussed by several groups of people, and very strict bio-safety guidelines were put in place and followed. This wasn\u2019t a scientist working in their garage doing whatever popped into their head. It was, carefully planned, well-thought out, closely monitored, rigorously controlled research in a secure, state-of-the-art laboratory (you can read the details on the CDC\u2019s website).\n\nTo be 100% clear, that obviously does not mean that no one ever goes rogue and operates outside of the system. There will always be people who break the rules, but those cases are rare, they are pretty close to impossible at a lab facility like Wuhan, and when those people get caught, the consequences are generally serious (such as loss of funding, loss of job, and sometimes prosecution). So, this notion that no one is telling scientists not to do things is simply false. There are constantly people checking our proposals and telling us not to do things.\n\nThis misconception matters, because it paints scientists as people who are totally disconnected from reality, blindly doing whatever interests us regardless of the dangers, but that\u2019s a caricature, not reality. Scientists are normal people. We think about things like ethics and broad implications, and we have people checking us. Further, this sort of caricature downplays the importance of labs like the Wuhan lab. It\u2019s not full of \u201cmad scientists.\u201d It\u2019s full of incredibly intelligent, thoughtful people doing important work that needs to be done if we are going to prevent future disease outbreaks and mitigate the ones that we fail to prevent. Indeed, that Spanish Flu research that Stewart mocked gave us important insights into how highly virulent pathogens operate, and those insights help us to prepare for future outbreaks. This sort of mischaracterization of scientists undermines the critical work that scientists do.\n\nThe lab leak conspiracy theory\n\nMoving on, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail debunking the Wuhan lab leak conspiracy theory, because it has been thoroughly covered elsewhere (e.g., Siegel 2021). Instead, I\u2019ll just hit a few highlights and point out some errors in Stewart\u2019s reasoning. Before I start, I do realize that much of what he said was deliberate hyperbole for comedic effect, so I have no intention of nitpicking his jokes and will instead focus on the broad strokes.\n\nThe crux of his argument was basically just proximity:\n\nThere is a lab in Wuhan that studies novel coronaviruses The novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan Therefore, it escaped from the lab\n\nTo anyone familiar with logic, this reasoning is clearly fallacious. It\u2019s a non sequitur fallacy. Just because the two things occurred in proximity doesn\u2019t mean that there was any relationship between them (note: you might argue that this is a correlation fallacy, but that generally involves trends, not isolated incidents; it is arguably a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy [i.e., there was a lab in Wuhan, then there was an outbreak; therefore the lab caused the outbreak]).\n\nIt is entirely possible for the co-occurrence of two things to be a coincidence, or for there to be some other factor that caused those two things to line up. In this case, the latter is true. Infectious disease labs very often focus on the pathogens around them, and as Colbert tried to point out to Stewart, China has many coronaviruses, and Wuhan is a massive city with an active wildlife trade. In other words, if a novel coronavirus was going to jump to humans, we would expect it to be in a city like Wuhan, which is why there was a coronavirus lab in Wuhan. As one virologist (Vincent Munster) commented,\n\n\u201cNine out of ten times, when there\u2019s a new outbreak, you\u2019ll find a lab that will be working on these kinds of viruses nearby\u201d (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021).\n\nSo, no, the fact that the outbreak originated in a city that has a coronavirus lab does not suggest that the outbreak was a result of a lab leak. That is extremely circumstantial evidence and totally ignores the fact that labs are often positioned in the areas where we\u2019d expect an outbreak.\n\nSimilarly, Stewart dismissed the abundance of bats around Wuhan by pointing out that there are also lots of bats in Texas, but the outbreak didn\u2019t start there. This is more specious logic (indeed, it\u2019s a reductio ad absurdum fallacy). It\u2019s not simply that there are bats in China, but rather that China is a hot spot of human-wildlife interactions. It is those interactions that are problematic and, it is something scientists have been warning about for years. Back in 2007, a paper in Clinical Microbiology Reviews said,\n\n\u201cThe presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb\u201d (Cheng et al. 2007).\n\nThis isn\u2019t a virus that came out of nowhere with no warnings. It\u2019s something scientists have worried about for a long time, which, once again, is why labs that study these diseases are so important, and why it is so dangerous to undercut them by spreading this kind of conspiracy theory. It\u2019s also, again, why this lab was in China.\n\nAs you can hopefully see, Stewart\u2019s arguments are bogus, but what should we make of the lab leak hypothesis more generally? As I said, I\u2019m not going to go into a ton of detail, because that is a whole series of posts in itself, but here are a few highlights.\n\nFirst, the WHO investigation into the Wuhan laboratory concluded that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the virus had escaped from the lab. Second, scientific assessments of the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 have shown that it is most likely natural. Andersen et al. (2020) found no evidence to suggest that it was man-made and,\n\n\u201cstrong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.\u201d\n\nIf the virus was engineered, we\u2019d see evidence of that in the genome, but we don\u2019t see that evidence. This is critical, because it means that even if it escaped from a lab, it was probably a natural virus that was being stored there, not one that was engineered. As you will see, however, the arguments for the lab leak hypothesis generally center around the virus not being natural (you can read more about this research and how we know the virus wasn\u2019t man-made in these articles: Bryner 2020; Hayes 2020; Saey 2020).\n\nSo, where does this leave the lab-leak hypothesis? It leaves it solidly in the territory of conspiracy theories that ignore official reports, cherry pick experts, and spin fanciful tales that attempt to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d based on circumstantial evidence. This hypothesis inherently requires that scientists and governments have lied and falsified records, but there is no actual evidence of that happening. It is just something that has to be blindly assumed in order for this conspiracy theory to be possible, and as a scientist, I have an aversion to making more assumptions than necessary.\n\nThe more scientific arguments for the lab leak hypothesis have tended to focus either on the fact that we have yet to find the original virus in the wild yet or on an unusual CGG-CGG sequence. The fact that we have not confirmed the original host is, however, hardly surprising. It often takes many years to track novel virus back to the original host. It took 14 years to find the origin of the SARS epidemic (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). So, 1.5 years of failed searching is hardly enough to conclude that it probably isn\u2019t natural. The other argument is that the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 has a CGG-CGG sequence that is unusual. CGG codes for the amino acid arginine, but there are several other ways to produce arginine, and CGG is relatively uncommon in coronavirus. This led David Baltimore to famously refer to the double CGG as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that the virus was man made. That statement was, however, misleading, because about 3% of the arginine sequences in SARS-CoV-2 are CGG, and CGG is found in plenty of other coronaviruses. It is, therefore, entirely possible for CGG-CGG to arise naturally, and even Baltimore has now acknowledged that it could be natural (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). Dr. Anderson, who wrote the study I mentioned earlier, explained the situation in more detail, here.\n\nFinally, what are we to make of various governments and even Dr. Fauci saying there should be thorough investigations? First, as I explained in a previous post this week, we should never conflate government decisions with scientific evidence. Second, if people like Fauci want more investigations, I don\u2019t really object (I don\u2019t think they are necessary, but I\u2019m not going to rant in opposition of them either). However, critically, as it stands right now, the weight of evidence is strongly against the lab leak hypothesis, and arguments to the contrary inevitably stray into the realm of conspiracy theories, conjecture, and baseless assumptions. As such, it is extremely problematic for a man like Stewart to insist on national television that the virus originated in a lab. Look, if you want to say, \u201cthe current evidence suggests that it did not escape the lab, but out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of being as certain as possible, we should conduct another investigation\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with that, but that is a very, very different thing from the type of proclamation that Stewart made or the types of conspiracy theories that I\u2019m seeing online. Further, it absolutely does not justify Stewart\u2019s rant about what he perceives as the dangers of science.\n\nLet me conclude this with a question. If you doubt the official reports and want another investigation, will you accept the results of that investigation if it shows the disease was natural? To put that another way, how many investigations are required to convince you? This is a question that is worth thinking about. It is always a good idea to ask yourself what it would take to convince you that you were wrong.\n\nUpdate 1-Sept-2021: A new review paper (Holmes et al. 2021) which was released after this post has reviewed the evidence for the lab leak hypothesis in even more detail, and concluded that the evidence strongly points away from that hypothesis.\n\nSources"

        "text": "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "text": "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "text": "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter."

        "text": "Joint Press Release\n\nThe energy crisis arising from the war in Ukraine may lead to further setbacks\n\nWashington, June 1, 2022 \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic has been a key factor in slowing progress toward universal energy access. Globally, 733 million people still have no access to electricity, and 2.4 billion people still cook using fuels detrimental to their health and the environment. At the current rate of progress, 670 million people will remain without electricity by 2030 \u2013 10 million more than projected last year.\n\nThe 2022 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report shows that the impacts of the pandemic, including lockdowns, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. Advances have been impeded particularly in the most vulnerable countries and those already lagging in energy access. Nearly 90 million people in Asia and Africa who had previously gained access to electricity, can no longer afford to pay for their basic energy needs.\n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on energy have been compounded in the last few months by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to uncertainty in global oil and gas markets and has sent energy prices soaring.\n\nAfrica remains the least electrified in the world with 568 million people without electricity access. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of the global population without electricity jumped to 77 percent in 2020 from 71 percent in 2018 whereas most other regions saw declines in their share of the access deficits. While 70 million people globally gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, this progress was not enough to keep pace with population growth, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cInternational public financing for renewable energy needs to accelerate, especially in the poorest, most vulnerable countries. We have failed to support those most in need. With only eight years left to achieve universal access to affordable and sustainable energy, we need radical actions to accelerate the increase of international public financial flows and distribute them in a more equitable manner, so 733 million people who are currently left behind can enjoy the benefits of clean energy access.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\n\nThe report finds that despite continued disruptions in economic activity and supply chains, renewable energy was the only energy source to grow through the pandemic. However, these positive global and regional trends in renewable energy have left behind many countries most in need of electricity. This was aggravated by a decrease in international financial flows for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019.\n\nSDG7 targets also cover energy efficiency. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent. This is well below the levels needed to meet SDG 7\u2019s targets and to make up for lost ground, the average rate of improvement would have to jump to 3.2 percent.\n\nIn September 2021, the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy brought together governments and stakeholders to accelerate action to achieve a sustainable energy future that leaves no one behind. In this context, the SDG 7 custodian agencies, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), as they launch this report, are urging the international community and policymakers to safeguard gains toward SDG 7; to remain committed to continued action towards affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all; and to maintain a strategic focus on countries needing the most support.\n\nKey highlights on SDG 7 targets\n\nAccess to electricity. The share of the world\u2019s population with access to electricity rose from 83 percent in 2010 to 91 percent in 2020, increasing the number of people with access by 1.3 billion globally. The number without access declined from 1.2 billion people in 2010 to 733 million in 2020. However, the pace of progress in electrification has slowed in recent years which may be explained by the increasing complexity of reaching more remote and poorer unserved populations and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting the 2030 target requires increasing the number of new connections to 100 million a year. At current rates of progress, the world will reach only 92 percent electrification by 2030.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, every region of the world showed consistent progress in electrification, but with wide disparities. Electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 46 percent in 2018 to 48 percent in 2020, but the region\u2019s share of the global access deficit rose from 71 percent in 2018 to 77 percent in 2020, whereas most other regions, including Central and Southern Asia, saw declines in their share of the access deficits. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for more than three-quarters of the people (568 million people) who remained without access in 2020.\n\nClean cooking. The share of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies rose to 69% in 2020, an increase of 3 percentage points over last year. However, population growth outpaced much of the gains in access, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the total number of people lacking access to clean cooking has remained relatively stagnant for decades. Between 2000 and 2010, this number was close to three billion people, or one-third of the global population. It dropped to around 2.4 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in access in large, populous countries in Asia. In contrast, the access deficit in Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly doubled since 1990, reaching a total of around 923 million people in 2020.\n\nA multisectoral, coordinated effort is needed to achieve the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It is critical that the global community learns from the successes and challenges faced by countries that have attempted to design and implement clean household energy policies.\n\nRenewables. Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy implies accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity, heat, and transport. Although there is no quantitative target for SDG 7.2, custodian agencies agree that the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) needs to rise significantly, even though renewable energy consumption did continue to grow through the pandemic, overcoming disruptions to economic activity and supply chains. While the share of renewable capacity expansion rose by a record amount in 2021, the positive global and regional trajectories mask the fact that countries where new capacity additions lagged were those most in need of increased access. Moreover, rising commodity, energy and shipping prices, as well as restrictive trade measures, have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, and biofuels, adding uncertainty for future renewable energy projects. Renewable shares need to reach well over 30 percent of TFEC by 2030, up from 18 percent in 2019, to be on track for reaching net-zero energy emissions by 2050. Achieving this objective would require strengthening policy support in all sectors and implementing effective tools to further mobilize private capital, especially in least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing countries.\n\nEnergy efficiency. SDG 7.3 aims to double the global rate of annual improvement in primary energy intensity\u2014the amount of energy used per unit of wealth created\u2014to 2.6 percent in 2010\u201330 versus 1990\u20132010. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent, well below the target, and the average annual rate of improvement now has to reach 3.2 percent to make up for lost ground. This rate would need to be even higher\u2014consistently over 4 percent for the rest of this decade\u2014if the world is to reach net-zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050, as envisioned in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Early estimates for 2020 point to a substantial decrease in intensity improvement because of the COVID-19 crisis, as a result of a higher share of energy-intensive activities in the economy and lower energy prices. The outlook for 2021 suggests a return to a 1.9 percent rate of improvement, the average rate during the previous decade, thanks to a sharper focus on energy efficiency policies, particularly in COVID-19 recovery packages. However, energy efficiency policies and investment need to be scaled up significantly to bring the SDG 7.3 target within reach.\n\nInternational Financial Flows. International public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy decreased for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019, despite the immense needs for sustainable development in most countries and growing urgency of climate change. The amount was down by nearly 24 per cent from the previous year and may be worsened by the pandemic in 2020. Overall, the level of financing remains below what is needed to reach SDG 7, particularly in the most vulnerable and least developed countries.\n\nThe decrease was seen in most regions, with the only exception in Oceania, where international public flows rose by 72 percent. The bulk of decreases were concentrated in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, where they fell 66.2 percent; Latin America and the Caribbean, where they dropped by 29.8 percent; and Central and Southern Asia, where they declined by 24.5 percent.\n\nAlthough the private sector finances most renewable energy investments, public finance remains key to attract private capital, including for creating an enabling environment for private investments, developing the needed infrastructure, and addressing perceived and real risks and barriers for investments in the energy transition. International public flows to countries that lack the financial resources to support their energy transitions constitute a large part of the international collaboration that will be needed for a global energy transition that would bring the world closer to achieving all SDGs.\n\nIndicators and data for tracking progress. Tracking global progress for SDG 7 targets requires high-quality, reliable and comparable data for informed and effective policymaking at the global, regional, and country levels. The quality of data has been improving through national and international cooperation and solid statistical capacity. National data systems improve as countries establish legal frameworks and institutional arrangements for comprehensive data collection for energy supply and demand balances; implement end-user surveys (e.g., households, businesses, etc.); and develop quality-assurance frameworks. However, after the pandemic hit and disrupted the rate of progress toward Goal 7, more investment in quality statistics is needed to know where we stand and how to get back on track. This is especially important for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries, to inform their national energy policies and strategies to ensure no one is left behind.\n\nThis is the eighth edition of this report, formerly known as the Global Tracking Framework (GTF). This year\u2019s edition was chaired by the World Bank.\n\nDownload the full report.\n\nFind the dashboards and additional information on the Tracking SDG 7 website.\n\nThis joint press release is also available in Arabic (\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a), French (Fran\u00e7ais), and Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)."

        "text": "Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater\n\nAt a Glance A system that combined advanced sample preparation with powerful computer analysis was able to identify individual SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater.\n\nUsing wastewater to track the emergence of new variants of concern could be faster and less expensive than clinical testing.\n\nkittirat roekburi / Shutterstock\n\nDuring infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, people shed virus down the drain every time they wash their hands or use the toilet. This can happen whether or not someone has symptoms of the disease.\n\nScientists have been tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as a way to estimate whether infections are rising or falling in communities. Using wastewater to track viral transmission has many potential advantages over clinical testing, which is expensive and requires people to seek out testing.\n\nTo date, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain information about specific variants of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater. RNA, the genetic material of the virus, is easily damaged. It\u2019s also relatively scarce in water samples. This has made it difficult to gather enough high-quality SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater to identify variants rather than just detect the virus in general.\n\nIn a new study, a team of researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Scripps Research Institute aimed to surmount these limitations. They designed a type of nanobead that binds efficiently to viral RNA in wastewater, allowing more to be captured intact for sequencing.\n\nThe team also developed a computer analysis tool to recognize small, distinct pieces of these sequences. It could rapidly tag different viral variants in the collected samples and estimate their abundance.\n\nThe researchers tested the new monitoring system between November 2020 and September 2021. They examined wastewater gathered daily around the UCSD campus. They also examined daily samples from the primary wastewater treatment plant serving the greater San Diego County. Results from the study, which was funded in part by NIH, were published on July 7, 2022, in Nature.\n\nTrends in the wastewater samples mirrored those from clinical testing over the study period. But the wastewater sampling system detected the Alpha, Delta, and other early variants about two weeks before they started to show up in clinical test samples. The system flagged the presence of the original Omicron variant in San Diego more than a week before it was picked up by clinical sampling in the community. This early detection occurred despite the researchers having less than 3% as many wastewater samples as clinical swabs.\n\nThe wastewater sampling continued to pick up variants in the community weeks after they no longer showed up regularly in clinical testing. It also picked up rare variants that were not found often in the clinic.\n\n\"The coronavirus will continue to spread and evolve, which makes it imperative for public health that we detect new variants early enough to mitigate consequences,\u201d says Dr. Rob Knight from UCSD, one of the study's lead authors.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of places, standard clinical surveillance for new variants of concern is not only slow but extremely cost-prohibitive,\u201d adds Dr. Kristian Andersen from Scripps, who also helped lead the work. \u201cBut with this new tool, you can take one wastewater sample and basically profile the whole city.\u201d\n\n\u2014by Sharon Reynolds"

I\u2019ve been overwhelmed with despair over the death and suffering. I\u2019ve been numb, trying to keep up with the deluge of COVID-19 studies. One balm has been the understanding of colleagues who also report on COVID-19.\n\nI found solace too in Virology, microbiologist Joseph Osmundson\u2019s book of 11 wide-ranging essays, in which he writes of the pandemic and calls for \u201ca new rhetoric of care.\u201d Osmundson includes journal entries from the pandemic, and some of his experi\u00adences are similar to mine. He dreams he\u2019s at a gathering where no one is masked. He too felt the \u201cdensity\u201d of the pandemic: \u201cEmotionally dense, with loss and struggle and even some\u00adtimes joy,\u201d he writes. \u201cScientifically dense, with papers and pre-prints out every day that need reading and some analysis.\u201d\n\nOsmundson doesn\u2019t just focus on the coronavirus. He jumps from other viruses and the immune system to illness and metaphors for illness, to sex and HIV, to archiving history and whose stories get told. Parts of the book feel like an anthology, with quotes from many writers who have weighed in on these topics. Parts are a call to care for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, wealth or who one loves.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nOverall, Osmundson questions how society thinks about viruses. \u201cViruses \u2026 are not evil, they don\u2019t invade. They just are,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe meaning we give a virus affects how we live with it.\u201d When we describe viruses as enemies and illness as a war, it \u201cassumes the necessity of casualties.\u201d He argues instead to focus resources on caring for one another.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, Osmundson, a gay man, is acutely aware of the messages that come with viruses. \u201cOur generation of gay men came after the plague,\u201d he writes. \u201cHIV didn\u2019t just kill bodies. It killed a type of sex as well, a type of pleasure.\u201d But new therapies have saved lives and altered perceptions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can prevent infection, while treatment can render HIV untransmissible (SN: 11/15/19). These advances changed our relationship with the virus, Osmundson writes. \u201cI used to think that HIV would make it harder to find love and sex. Now we know that HIV-positive and undetectable is safe. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d\n\nBut the biomedicine that can change our relationship with viruses has not been wielded equitably, Osmundson observes. He returns throughout the book to our common humanity. \u201cThat fact of all our bodies, vulnerable together, necessitates mutual care.\u201d\n\nBuy Virology from Bookshop.org.

        "text": "After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 \u2014 including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of are-they-just-colds? scares and lots of negative tests \u2014 I recently tested positive.\n\nIt felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now \u201cit.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I still wore my mask inside public spaces (SN: 3/25/22). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold.\n\nTwo thick lines on my rapid test said otherwise (SN: 12/17/21). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what?\n\nThese are my results the day I tested positive for COVID-19. I took two rapid at-home tests just to be extra sure \u2014 and then got a PCR test from a testing site so my results could be included in official case counts. A. Gibbs\n\nI had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house.\n\nIt got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn\u2019t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought.\n\nWhen it comes to reporting at-home tests, \u201cthere is no formal recommendation,\u201d says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it\u2019s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic: Now that at-home tests are free and easy to access, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test.\n\nCases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn\u2019t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\u2019s data show that only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled \u201cCan we trust case numbers?\u201d\n\nTo make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test.\n\nBut until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we\u2019re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what\u2019s going on in your community, though.\n\nFor starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community monitors wastewater, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. Outbreaks Near Me, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nIn general, \u201cbe aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,\u201d Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: \u201cIf you start to hear, like, \u2018Hey, you know, I\u2019ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,\u2019 that\u2019s probably a really good indicator \u2026 that there\u2019s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.\u201d And that it\u2019s a good time to start taking extra precautions again.\n\nSpeaking of precautions, according to the isolation guidelines put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can still be contagious after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s a complicated question. There\u2019s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator \u2014 albeit imperfect \u2014 of current contagiousness. (That\u2019s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.)\n\nHow contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC\u2019s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days.\n\nBut several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms, about half of the players still showed significant viral load. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that 43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,\u201d Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. \u201cI would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,\u201d Mina says. \u201cThat was based on old data.\u201d\n\nInstead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you\u2019re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there\u2019s likely less virus in your body.\n\nBut because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, \u201cyou should assume that you\u2019re infectious\u201d if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you\u2019ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative.\n\nBy my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be.\n\nI wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it\u2019s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, not enough knowledge to make such decisions (SN: 6/16/21).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to be confused about all this,\u201d Mina says. \u201cI think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.\u201d Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds.\n\nAs for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina\u2019s advice on testing negative twice, I\u2019m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now."

        "link": "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus",
        "text": "In the year before the omicron variant began to spread in the United States, an estimated one-third of 18- to 45-year-olds had gotten sick with COVID-19. Just three months later, that figure doubled, and I was among the people who caught the coronavirus for the first time.\n\nI was in the first wave of people who got omicron in December 2021, as I was finishing my fall semester at Cornell University. On the day I received my positive test result, I knew it was coming. I had a sore throat, cough and my whole body ached. For the next several days, I was so tired that I had to sleep for more than half the day while trying to finish my final exams and help report on the outbreak for my college daily newspaper. Days later, after taking every vitamin, supplement and over-the-counter medicine I could get, I tried to get back to my normal routine, starting with a workout on Zoom. I found myself needing to stop every couple of minutes to catch my breath.\n\nTime passed. I began to exhaust the list of YouTube workouts, and I began to feel better, but I never really got to 100 percent. Six months later, my friends and family no longer asked: \u201cDo you feel any better?\u201d In some ways I do. But between feeling much more out of breath every time I go to exercise than I used to or often hitting a wall at 3 p.m., I\u2019ve wondered: Am I among the estimated 1 in 5 people in the United States who have long COVID?\n\nWhat initially seems like a simple question is actually much more complicated than yes or no. There is no biological test \u2014 no swab or blood test \u2014 to say that someone has long COVID. Doctors and public health organizations don\u2019t have a universal definition of the condition.\n\nPutting a name to it\n\nWhile the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was given the name COVID-19 in February 2020, long COVID surfaced a few months later as a hashtag on Twitter when Elisa Perego began using the term in her tweets. The archaeology researcher who has become a long COVID advocate, first fell ill in late winter of 2020 in Lombardy, Italy. Three months later, she relapsed \u2014 her blood oxygen levels began to drop again, and she may have had a small blood clot in her lungs. This was not the same COVID-19 that Perego was seeing on the news.\n\n\u201cFor me, the idea of long COVID was about reframing COVID,\u201d she told me over e-mail because of ongoing symptoms that make it difficult to talk for long periods of time. The term not only gave her experiences a name but began to unite what was a growing group of those who had COVID-19 and couldn\u2019t seem to shake the aftereffects.\n\n\u201cVery prolonged positive tests were being talked about in Italy. A grassroots movement of people who weren\u2019t recovering from COVID was burgeoning on Twitter and other media,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I thought the hashtag and the name long COVID could be a way to link this growing community.\u201d\n\nSince then, other terms have also been used: post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection, or PASC, post-acute COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses that last one, writing broadly \u201cpost-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that people experience after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe only clear distinction that health professionals seem to agree on when it comes to long COVID is that it is the emergence or change of symptoms some time after being infected with the coronavirus. But how long after and what those symptoms are aren\u2019t universally agreed upon.\n\nRight now, that may be for the best, experts say.\n\nA broad definition helps people with long COVID recognize that they have it and receive the care they need, says neuroscientist David Putrino at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It also helps people from historically excluded groups who have long COVID get a proper diagnosis, when they may have otherwise been written off and labeled as psychosomatic.\n\nYet, even with a broad definition, people might not know they have it. While recently recruiting for a long COVID clinical trial, Putrino found that about half of the people that reported they had \u201cfully recovered\u201d failed his screening for post-COVID conditions because they still had lingering symptoms.\n\nMany of these people fall into a similar camp as I do: They are not debilitated but they are \u201cslowed down.\u201d And similar to me, Putrino says, many of them say that they have fully recovered but have one symptom that doesn\u2019t seem to go away \u2014 like having trouble exercising or needing to go to sleep much earlier than they used to or noticing they need an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nWhen COVID-19 becomes long COVID\n\nA key question in knowing who has long COVID is defining when acute COVID ends and long COVID begins. And there is disagreement there, too. The CDC starts its clock for long COVID at four weeks post-infection, while the World Health Organization says it\u2019s closer to 12 weeks. The National Institutes of Health, in recruiting for its initiative to study long COVID, defines \u201cpost-acute\u201d as starting 30 days after infection for children but does not define the window for adults.\n\nThere\u2019s risk in making the time too short or too long. Too short, and doctors may include people that are just having a particularly long bout of acute COVID. They are likely to recover regardless of treatment, so including them makes it difficult to determine if a long COVID treatment is effective. For his work, Putrino is firmly in \u201cteam WHO\u201d because he says that there are people that are still dealing with the acute symptoms of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 four weeks in.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to propagate the narrative that a certain percentage of long COVID patients spontaneously recover,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. I think that the individuals who are sick at four weeks who then go on to recover without doing anything interventional were just individuals who were still sick with COVID and ultimately recovered.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the start point is too far off, it will delay people getting care.\n\nThis is why Perego leans toward the four-week timeframe so that people can seek care sooner. But she says that researchers may want to track changes in a person\u2019s condition over longer periods of time.\n\n\u201cClinically, my hope would be to have support as early as possible. The timing of the disease development might change in different patients,\u201d she says. \u201cThere might be changes into how the disease develops with vaccination and the new variants. But I don\u2019t like the idea of letting people with no in-depth care to wait for the moment they match a specific clinical case definition, which might be an artificial construct and quite delayed.\u201d\n\nIn a lot of ways, defining long COVID is like trying to hit a moving target but better understanding how long COVID changes over time will help researchers \u201cfigure out exactly what it is and maybe what it isn\u2019t,\u201d says Josh Fessel, a senior clinical advisor at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a part of the National Institutes of Health. Aside from tracking timing, another way to do that is tracking symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of long COVID\n\nI had what all of the experts I talked with see as the most common symptoms \u2014 fatigue and shortness of breath. But others have trouble thinking or concentrating, a pounding heart, joint or muscle aches to name a few (SN: 2/2/22). While this long list of potential symptoms casts as wide a net as possible, it also creates a \u201cdiagnosis of exclusion,\u201d says Emily Pfaff, a clinical informaticist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In order for patients to know they have long COVID, they must first prove that their symptoms don\u2019t have other causes.\n\n\u201cThat is an effort to ensure that we\u2019re not confusing long COVID with other stuff, but what that can do is sort of put patients on this kind of diagnostic odyssey where they\u2019re trying to match up their symptoms and their physicians and providers are trying to match them up with various diseases only to rule those out in order to say \u2018Yes, maybe this is long COVID,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nWhat makes ruling conditions out and homing in on long COVID difficult is that long COVID has flavors; it doesn\u2019t come with the same symptoms, and it may not be caused by the same thing in everyone who has it. \u201c\u200b\u200bWe envision that long COVID has at least seven different mechanisms,\u201d says Joan Soriano, a medical epidemiologist who helped WHO write its definition of long COVID. \u201cThis is similar to chronic fatigue syndrome or post-intensive care unit syndrome. Accordingly, any definition of long COVID will not be simple.\u201d\n\nA definition of long COVID has to encompass people who may still have virus circulating in their bodies, those who may have had autoimmune issues following infection, still others who have microclots in their blood and maybe people like me with a nagging feeling of not being quite back to normal. As researchers try to understand long COVID, and how to treat it, they will need to differentiate between these different flavors, called endotypes, Putrino says. Different flavors will call for different treatments. Something like an antiviral will probably work only for those people whose long COVID symptoms are caused by viral persistence. A blood thinner wouldn\u2019t work for them but could help those with microclots.\n\nOne thing that could help with grouping the flavors of long COVID and recognizing how symptoms persist in large groups of patients is artificial intelligence, Soriano says. This is the type of work Pfaff, at UNC, is currently doing. She is creating a machine learning algorithm that can look at a patient\u2019s health records and predict if they will have long COVID. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be 100 percent,\u201d she says. But her algorithm is beginning to be able to accurately predict who will have it, and she is beginning to use it to figure out what flavor they might have.\n\nData, however, can\u2019t operate in a vacuum, she says. Researchers need information from people like me and many others to get a firm grasp on what long COVID is and how to treat it. Merging hospital data with survey data from patients is the only way forward on creating a definition, Pfaff says.\n\nI\u2019m still not sure where I stand with my own case. A couple of weeks ago, I felt sheepish even mentioning that having long COVID was something that was on my mind. Long COVID is not something that really comes up in my everyday conversations, especially as an active 22-year-old. That quickly changed when Putrino, unprompted, described a class of people who just can\u2019t get back to working out, or need an extra cup of coffee to keep up with their pre-COVID pace. This described how I have felt for months to a tee. Putrino, Pfaff and Fessel agreed that I fall into what is generally a pretty large group of people with long COVID, and Fessel told me he wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if I were to apply to enroll in the NIH\u2019s clinical trial.\n\nStill, I struggled to use the term. I haven\u2019t been put out of work as Perego and hundreds of thousands of others have. Despite my aversion to saying I have long COVID because it has disrupted the lives of so many more than it has my own, defining the broad spectrum of experiences it\u2019s led to may be important. Until we have reliable tests for the condition, what matters is people sharing their individual experiences."

A bonus: The canines are cuter and less invasive than a swab up the nose.\n\nIn a study involving sweat samples from 335 people, trained dogs sniffed out 97 percent of the coronavirus cases that had been identified by PCR tests, researchers report June 1 in PLOS One. And the dogs found all 31 COVID-19 cases among 192 people who didn\u2019t have symptoms.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nThese findings are evidence that dogs could be effective for mass screening efforts at places such as airports or concerts and may provide friendly alternatives for testing people who balk at nasal swabs, says Dominique Grandjean, a veterinarian at the National School of Veterinary Medicine of Alfort in Maisons-Alfort, France.\n\n\u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d but there are many ways PCR tests can go wrong, Grandjean says. The canines\u2019 noses also identified more COVID-19 cases than did antigen tests (SN: 12/17/21), similar to many at-home tests, but sometimes mistook another respiratory virus for the coronavirus, Grandjean and colleagues found. What\u2019s more, anecdotal evidence suggests the dogs can pick up asymptomatic cases as much as 48 hours before people test positive by PCR, he says.\n\nIn the study, dogs from French fire stations and from the Ministry of the Interior of the United Arab Emirates were trained in coronavirus detection by rewarding them with toys \u2014 usually tennis balls. \u201cIt\u2019s playtime for them,\u201d Grandjean says. It takes about three to six weeks, depending on the dog\u2019s experience with odor detection, to train a dog to pick out COVID-19 cases from sweat samples.\n\nThe dogs then sniffed cones housing sweat samples collected from human volunteers\u2019 underarms. Swabbing the sweat off the back of people\u2019s necks or giving the woofers a whiff of used face masks worked just as well, Grandjean says.\n\nThose results indicate that odors from multiple body sites can be used for canine screening, says Kenneth Furton, a forensic chemist at Florida International University in Miami who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe results are similar to previous, smaller studies that also found that dogs perform as well as or even better than PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Furton says. He and colleagues have used dogs at schools, a music festival and in a small trial screening airline employees for coronavirus infections.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages dogs have over other tests is their speed, Furton says. \u201cEven with what we call a rapid test, you\u2019re still going to have to wait tens of minutes or even hours, where the dog in a matter of seconds or even fractions of seconds can make a response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what dogs are smelling when they detect COVID-19 or other diseases, says Cynthia Otto, director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s working dog center, who was not involved in the study. It may not be a single chemical, but rather a pattern of increasing and decreasing levels of certain aromas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you could create an odor perfume bottle that would be the scent of COVID,\u201d she says.\n\nEven with repeated studies demonstrating dogs\u2019 COVID-detection prowess, some doctors, scientists and government officials have been skeptical of the claims, Grandjean says. He finds the reluctance puzzling, because dogs are already used to sniff out drugs and explosives, and are being tested for detecting other diseases, such as cancer, he says. \u201cEvery time you take a plane, it\u2019s because dogs have been sniffing your luggage [and found] no explosives. So you trust them when you take a plane, but you don\u2019t want to trust them for COVID?\u201d\n\nOne challenge with dogs, says Furton, is that people don\u2019t think of them as high-tech the way electronic sensors are. \u201cBut dogs are one of the highest-tech devices we have. They\u2019re just biological sensors, instead of electronic sensors,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother drawback for dogs is that they take time to train and there currently aren\u2019t even enough dogs trained to detect explosives, let alone diseases, Otto says. And \u201cdogs that work well in that lab setting may not work well in a people setting,\u201d she says. Handlers can also influence the dog\u2019s response and must be able to read the dog well, she says. \u201cWe need more good dogs.\u201d"

There was a problem signing you up.\n\nAstronomers routinely use gravitational waves \u2014 traveling ripples in the fabric of space and time itself, first detected in 2015 \u2014 to watch cataclysmic events that are hard to study with light alone, such as the merging of two black holes (SN: 2/11/16).\n\nBut physicists have also known about a seemingly useless property of gravitational waves: They can change course. Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity says that spacetime gets warped by matter, and any wave passing through these distortions will change course. The upshot is that when something emits gravitational waves, part of the signal comes straight at Earth, but some might arrive later \u2014 like an echo \u2014 after taking longer paths that bend around a star or anything else heavy.\n\nScientists have always thought these later signals, called \u201cgravitational glints,\u201d should be too weak to detect. But physicists Craig Copi and Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, took a leap: Working off Einstein\u2019s theory, they calculated how strong the signal would be when waves scatter through the gravitational field inside a star itself.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing is that you seem to get a much larger result than you would have expected,\u201d Copi says. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re still trying to understand, where that comes from \u2014 whether it\u2019s believable, even, because it just seems too good to be true.\u201d\n\nIf gravitational glints can be so strong, astronomers could possibly use them to trace the insides of stars, the team says. Researchers could even look for massive bodies in space that would otherwise be impossible to detect, like globs of dark matter or lone neutron stars on the other side of the observable universe.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be a very exciting probe,\u201d says Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThere are still reasons to be cautious, though. If this phenomenon stands up to more detailed scrutiny, Fishbach says, scientists would have to understand it better before they could use it \u2014 and that will probably be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard calculation,\u201d Copi says.\n\nBut similar challenges have been overcome before. \u201cThe whole story of gravitational wave detection has been like that,\u201d Fishbach says. It was a struggle to do all the math needed to understand their measurements, she says, but now the field is taking off (SN: 1/21/21). \u201cThis is the time to really be creative with gravitational waves.\u201d"

In the Caribbean, hospitalizations continue to increase in Cuba, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe PAHO Director highlighted that, as is also the case in Europe, Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages are becoming the predominant strains in the Americas, but with one key difference \u2013 vaccination coverage.\n\nHigh vaccination coverage in Europe means that most COVID-19 patients have been able to safely manage their symptoms at home but in the Americas \u201ca third of the population remains unvaccinated and ten countries and territories have yet to protect even 40% of their populations,\u201d she said.\n\nGiven the increased transmissibility of the new sub-lineages, Dr. Etienne urged countries to implement public health measures, such as social distancing and mask wearing, and advised that hospitals in areas with low vaccination coverage should \u201cbrace themselves\u201d for an influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe PAHO Director said that countries must also prepare for monkeypox, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) this weekend.\n\nIn the Americas, numbers have reached almost 5300 across 18 countries and territories.\n\nBut while nearly all cases so far have been reported among men who have sex with men between the ages of 25 and 45, the Director warned against stigma and discrimination, underscoring that \u201canyone, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, can get monkeypox.\u201d\n\nPAHO continues to work with Member States on COVID-19 response and has also issued guidance for health workers to manage monkeypox cases and prevent further infections.\n\nTurning to the recent case of vaccine-derived polio type 2 case reported in the United States, Dr. Etienne warned that while the Americas has been polio-free since 1994 thanks to good vaccination coverage and surveillance, in recent years polio vaccination rates have dropped considerably.\n\nThe Director said that low vaccination coverage is \u201cextremely worrisome,\u201d putting children at risk of \u201cdevastating diseases that have been eliminated in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to be complacent,\u201d she added, and must use the tools at our disposal to keep our populations healthy.\u201d"

The theme of the report is: Working through the COVID-19 Pandemic. The period covered has been the most challenging ever encountered by PAHO. The pandemic, through its devastating health and economic consequences, has severely impacted people\u2019s lives and livelihoods and disrupted countries, societies, economies, and their development. This has occurred in conjunction with the inevitable challenges on the road to equitable, sustainable development and the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas 2018\u20132030. The publication opens with a preface by the Director of PASB, a concise executive summary, and a brief introduction. It then presents a comprehensive review of PAHO\u2019s technical cooperation, and of the Bureau\u2019s institutional and strengthening functions. The report highlights achievements, challenges, and lessons learned as the Bureau undertook technical cooperation with PAHO Member States at national, subregional, and regional levels within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, working with traditional and new partners to find equitable solutions for emerging and persisting health issues in the Region of the Americas. It also looks ahead, analyzing those opportunities brought to light by the COVID-19 experience for strengthening PAHO\u2019s promotion of and contribution to equity and progressive realization of the right to health. Moreover, it indicates how the Bureau, with the concurrence and guidance of Member States, and in collaboration with partners, will take advantage of such opportunities. This report is complemented by the Financial Report of the Director, and the Report of the External Auditor for the year 2020."

        "link": "https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/faustfiles/100057",
        "text": "In the second part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, and Paul Offit, MD, discuss the ambiguity of long COVID, the risks of pediatric COVID, and the \"human price to pay for knowledge.\"\n\nOffit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Watch part one of this two-part discussion here.\n\nThe following is a transcript of their remarks:\n\nJeremy Faust, MD: If you're advising my parents, who are in their 70s, should they get their fourth dose right now because they haven't gotten it yet? Or should they wait until the bivalent [vaccine] comes on in the fall because they're trying to avoid infection or anything else? So what should they do? Should they just do it now? Or should they wait?\n\nPaul Offit, MD: First of all, it's really hard to avoid infection. It is. I mean, these are highly contagious viruses; they're immune evasive. It's a short incubation-period mucosal respiratory infection, so at some level, we're going to have to try and find a way to accept mild infection. Even for those who are at highest risk, what are we going to do? Boost twice a year? It is just not a practical strategy, I think.\n\nIn answer to your question, I guess I would wait and see what the data show. Hopefully we'll have much more vigorous data regarding this sort of bivalent vaccine that contains BA5 because it looks like that's the way the [Biden] administration wants to go. We'll have clear data on that, and if that's true, then I would wait because I really do think people make a mistake when they give boosters very close together. You really should wait several months to do that. I disagree with the people who occasionally say, 'Well, get it now and then you can get it again later.' No, let's wait; wait until later to see what this BA5 looks like.\n\nFaust: Alright, let's talk about vaccines and long COVID. We know that we know nothing, but there's certainly a concern that this virus, this pandemic, is sort of a mass event for creating disability. Even if there's a range of estimates on how much long COVID there is, and even if the lowest estimates are true, it's still a ton of people. Do you think we're going to get a readout on whether vaccines and boosts in particular help otherwise healthy people avoid long COVID, or is that just going to be impossible to sort out?\n\nOffit: Well, you said it, we need to define this phenomenon of long COVID. Right now, you read estimates that range anywhere from 5% of people who suffer natural infection up to 50% of people. For example, the United States has a higher rate of long COVID than Europe does, so we have a definition problem. We clearly need to define it as objectively as possible because it's a real entity, and the part of it that worries me is the vasculitis part. I mean, this is a virus that can cause you to make an immune response to your own endothelial cells that line blood vessels, so therefore all organs are at risk.\n\nYou do need to have a defined way of doing this because now if you look at these meta-analyses, the symptom that seems to come up to the top most frequently is fatigue, which is hard to define. Fatigue, pain, those are whatever you say they are. It's not like measuring your blood pressure or temperature. It's not so easily defined, so define it! Find a much clearer way of defining it than saying, 'Are you tired when you get up in the morning? Have you been tired for weeks?' because it sets itself up for just including far more people.\n\nI feel sorry now for employers and for insurance companies that are now going to try and figure out how to deal with the massive amount of disability that no doubt is going to follow this virus. We need to define it immunologically, virologically, and at some level, psychologically. We have to do that. We have to because it's going to be a big hit associated with this diagnosis.\n\nFaust: Long COVID is obviously a concern across the age spectrum, but a lot of young people are worried about it. But there's a group of people that are really maybe relatively low risk, but really of our concern and is an area of great interest in your career, and this is pediatrics; in kids. What's your stance on pediatric vaccines? And how do you respond to the idea that COVID either isn't that bad for kids and they don't need a vaccine, or maybe even if it is on a population level, too many have been exposed anyway so why do it? Where are we on pediatric COVID vaccines?\n\nOffit: Right. Well, we all have our biases. I guess mine is that I work at a children's hospital, so I do see children come into our hospital who suffer this disease.\n\nIf you look sort of just at the data that we were presented at the FDA vaccine advisory committee when we made this decision in mid-June about vaccines for less than 5-year-olds, it is clear that there are at least millions of children who've been infected who are less than 5 years of age. It's also clear that at least children have been hospitalized -- and if you look at the CDC data, thousands and thousands have been hospitalized, and according to CDC data, about 200 have died from this virus.\n\nNow, you want to make sure you have good data there. Is it that they're getting hospitalized or dying with this virus or from this virus? We need to make that very clear, and I think that's a little less clear. I can certainly say that we see children who come into our hospital because they have COVID or are treated because they have COVID; some of whom end up in the intensive care unit. It's real, and for that reason it should be prevented.\n\nSo then the question becomes when is the best time to vaccinate, I think. Because if you make the assumption that the virus can cause death at any age -- which is true -- if you make the assumption that this virus is going to be with us for years, if not decades, which I think is also true, then the question is: When to vaccinate? Because every year in this country 3.5 to more than 4 million children are brought into this world who are fully susceptible to this virus, and this virus is going to be around for a long time. We are going to need to have a high level of population immunity to protect them. So [the question] when to vaccinate, is what I would argue.\n\nNow, in the worst case scenario, it may be that if you find that memory responses, which were associated generally with protection against severe disease, fade after 5 years or 10 years and you need to re-vaccinate later, fine. But at least you've protected them during that period of time.\n\nFaust: Can I ask you for a clinical impression? I'll set it up by sharing a little bit of mine. In early 2020, COVID pneumonia was on every x-ray. They come in and it's like, 'Wow, this is a crazy x-ray. Why do I keep seeing this thing?'\n\nAnd then in the Delta/Omicron period, where you had a lot of people coming into the hospital even though they were vaccinated, that group didn't have COVID pneumonia. They were being hospitalized for emphysema, but COVID exacerbated it so it's COVID's fault, but it's not COVID pneumonia.\n\nWhat do you see in kids who are unvaccinated who get hospitalized? Are they having that COVID pneumonia like I was seeing in early 2020, or is it a kid who's dehydrated who just can't go home?\n\nOffit: No. I was on service a few weeks ago and we saw an unvaccinated adolescent who came in, who clearly had COVID pneumonia. I mean, he was sick. He required supplemental oxygen; his oxygen saturation levels were low. If you looked at his x-ray and his CT scan, it was striking and clearly COVID pneumonia.\n\nFaust: And what do you say to people who were out there saying, 'Look, this is so rare [in kids]. We don't need to make kids have to get vaccinated. They don't have hypoxia.' You know, the downplayers, how do you reach them? What do you say to them?\n\nOffit: It's not rare enough. I think if this was like rhinovirus, and it's basically a common cold virus, and it's not the kind of thing that's going to cause you to be hospitalized or go to the ICU or die, fine. But it's not that virus; this virus is much scarier.\n\nThe scariest aspect to me is this MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory disease in children, which is striking. You have a child, typically between 5 and 13 years of age -- an average 9 years of age -- who comes in and usually has a fairly trivial infection that was picked up serendipitously because they were exposed to a friend or family member. A month later, they come back; they're not shedding virus, they're antigen negative; PCR negative, but they have high fever, they have evidence of pulmonary disease, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease. It is a frightening illness and they will occasionally die. That is a post-infectious inflammatory disease that is caused by a respiratory virus, and I haven't seen anything like that before. That to me is the most compelling reason to get vaccinated, actually, because it's just so different from what you normally see.\n\nBut, you know, this virus can cause severe illness. Yes, it's relatively rare, but it certainly compares to the other viruses for which we have vaccines. I mean, if you're willing to get a polio vaccine or a flu vaccine or a chickenpox vaccine or measles vaccine, this virus compares to those in terms of how likely it is to kill you.\n\nFaust: We're running out of time, but I can't resist, why is it that MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, seems to have gone down in incidents in the Delta and Omicron period? This is a tremendous relief, but why do we think that happened?\n\nOffit: It has. I mean, I think it was the data out of South Africa regarding Omicron and subvariants that [said] that MIS-C is definitely less common. You would have to argue that the price that the virus is paying to be more contagious, which is to say the mutations that are associated with immune evasiveness, are also associated with a lesser virulence...\n\nFaust: Which favors spread of the virus, actually.\n\nOffit: Right, In theory, if you anthropomorphize the virus, it's never to the virus' advantage to kill you. I mean, if it wants to live, and presumably it does, then it's easier to spread from person to person if you're not dead.\n\nFaust: Right. At the extremes, the symptomatology has some impact on the reproductive number, but only at the extremes. Other than that, a little bit more virulent, a little bit less; it doesn't matter.\n\nI think you are the perfect person to ask this, what I think will be my final question: That is that whenever we are looking at a therapeutic or a vaccine or any intervention in a pandemic environment, you have to balance the need to act with incomplete information in an emergency setting versus waiting until you have enough data that says this is a safe, effective, and even cost-effective approach. How do you balance that?\n\nI sense that your balance is a little bit more towards the second one when you sense it is safe to wait, but how do you tell people to make that balance? Because most people are saying, 'Oh, we've got to act. We've got to act, forget it, no time for data.'\n\nOffit: Right. Good question. We on the FDA vaccine advisory committee have continued to face that ever since December of 2020, especially for the childhood vaccines; for the vaccine for less than 5-year-olds. Because the question is never 'When do you know everything?,' because you never know everything. The question is, 'When do you know enough?' When do you cross that line where you feel comfortable that you know enough [while] knowing there's always a human price to pay for knowledge.\n\nI mean, if you go back to December 2020, there was a death in that placebo group associated with that. I give a lot of credit to these parents who volunteer for these trials knowing their child may be injected with a placebo, knowing that their child may suffer the disease because of that decision. And it's the same for us, because the decision not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different risk. Our goal is to try and figure out how to advise parents or others to take the lesser risk.\n\nI'll just add one story because I'm an old person, as you can see since this is a video. I'm a child of the fifties. If you look at the polio vaccine story. So we always hail Jonas Salk, rightfully, as a critical researcher in the development of the polio vaccine. Well, when we did that trial -- when Thomas Francis ran that so-called Francis Field Trial of the polio vaccine between 1954 and 1955 -- you had 1.2 million children who were vaccinated, ultimately. It was about 400,000 children that were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, 200,000 received the placebo shot, and you had another 1.2 million children who were observed on inactivated controls. It was like a 1.8-million child study; a huge study.\n\nJonas Salk didn't want to do that study. He didn't. He felt he'd vaccinated 700 children in the Pittsburgh area, he thought that the immune response was excellent, it was an inactivated vaccine, he could not imagine that anyone should ever do a trial with a placebo. He couldn't conscience that trial.\n\nThe 1.2 million children who were observed uninoculated were really a nod to him. He did not want to inoculate children with placebo in the mid-1950s, knowing that every year 20,000 to 30,000 children suffered paralysis, and about 1,500 children died of polio.\n\nSo when Thomas Francis gets up and he makes the announcement that the vaccine was safe, potent, and effective -- three words that appeared on the headline of every newspaper in this country -- how did he know it was effective? He knew it was effective because 16 children died of polio in that study, all in the placebo group. He knew it was effective because there were 36 children who were paralyzed in that study, 34 in the placebo group.\n\nThose were first and second graders in the 1950s; I was a first and second grader in the 1950s. Those children could have lived long, productive lives but for the flip of a coin. There is always a human price to pay for knowledge, and that's the hardest part of all of this.\n\nFaust: And yet if they don't do that study, or they don't do the study today, how many people will die or have bad outcomes because they say, 'Well, I'm not going to do it just because some fancy doctor said it works'? People will be convinced, ultimately, by a combination of education through their pediatricians or through the press, or even through experience where they say, 'Look, every kid I know who had this bad outcome didn't have a vaccine.' Eventually, the anecdotal evidence kind of piles up in a way that's meaningful. Is that fair?\n\nOffit: I mean, you're certainly right. You don't convince people without doing those kinds of studies. And in fact, if you look at these two mRNA vaccines, as big as those studies were that were presented back in December 2020 -- 40,000 for Pfizer and 30,000 for Moderna, those are the size of any typical pediatric or adult vaccine trial -- still, we didn't know about myocarditis or pericarditis as a consequence of that vaccine. You knew that only when millions of children were vaccinated.\n\nMaurice Hilleman, who I consider to be the father of modern vaccines in many ways because he did the primary research development on nine of the 14 vaccines that we give children, said it best. He said, 'I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first 3 million doses are out there.\" But that's never going to be done pre-licensure or preapproval. So that's how you learn.\n\nMedical innovation invariably comes with a human cost either way, either because you do get the vaccine or because you don't get the vaccine.\n\nFaust: Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Your analysis has been almost singular in the public conversation in terms of balancing what I would call an exceedingly pro-vaccine stance while insisting on excellent science so that we eventually reach the most people. So thank you for doing that and for joining us here today.\n\nOffit: My pleasure. Thank you.\n\nEmily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today.

One study found that 17% of vaccinated college students had culturable virus after day 5 from symptom onset, with the latest on day 12. Another found the median time to culture conversion to negative was 6 days after an initial diagnosis with a PCR test.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the data \"suggest that a negative RAT result in individuals with residual symptoms could provide reassurance about ending isolation.

And if you like what you hear, a five-star rating goes a long way in helping us spread the word!\n\nThank you for joining us here on Anamnesis, a medical storytelling podcast from MedPage Today. My name is Shannon Firth. I'm a reporter with MedPage and I'll be your host for this episode.\n\nFor those of you who listen in regularly, this month's episode will be a little different. Instead of three stories from individual clinicians on a theme, we're bringing you just one story. An important story focused on the underreported, sometimes overlooked, challenges for nurses who struggle with substance use.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the public romanticized the role of nurses, casting them as superheroes -- women and men who sacrificed everything for their patients. But for many, the grief, stress, and exhaustion took a toll. In one survey, nearly half of critical care nurses said they felt depressed, and a third said they were drinking more. Six percent said they felt suicidal.\n\nAnd that's where the story of Tiffany Swedeen comes in.\n\nOver the holidays, a nurse in recovery from opioid use disorder struggled to keep her addiction in check. She was caring for coronavirus patients on the front lines in an ICU outside Seattle. She asked her hospital for more support, and received little. She reached out to her family, but that just made things worse. On Sunday, January 3, 2021, Tiffany Swedeen relapsed.\n\nTiffany's story highlights the fact that when it comes to substance use disorders, our healthcare system has one standard for patients and another for nurses. And while nurses have responsibilities not only to themselves, but to the public, it's worth remembering that substance use disorder is still a chronic but treatable brain disease, and not a moral failing.\n\nThis episode of Anamnesis features discussions of drug abuse and suicide that may be disturbing to some listeners. Discretion is advised.\n\nChapter 1. Blacked Out on Fentanyl for a Day (2:40) -- A nurse in recovery shares one of her loneliest moments.\n\nChapter 2. Job, License, and Livelihood on the Line (11:09) -- After diverting drugs, the foundation begins to crack for this nurse.\n\nChapter 3. Nurses Are Not Unbreakable (26:20) -- We as a society need to serve nurses better.\n\nEpisode produced and hosted by Shannon Firth\n\nSpecial thanks to Crystal Phend\n\nSound engineering by Emily Hutto\n\nTheme music by Palomar\n\nWant to share your story?

        "text": "A wide range of symptoms and conditions cropped up in children and adolescents in the year after a COVID-19 infection, though they were seemingly spared from mental and breathing issues, a CDC study reported.\n\nCompared with peers not diagnosed with COVID-19, young people ages 0-17 years with laboratory-confirmed illness were significantly more likely to develop the following conditions within 31-365 days of diagnosis:\n\nAcute pulmonary embolism (adjusted HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.62-2.50)\n\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy (adjusted HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.81-2.19)\n\nVenous thromboembolic events (adjusted HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.54-2.26)\n\nAcute and unspecified renal failure (adjusted HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43)\n\nType 1 diabetes (adjusted HR 1.23, 1.13-1.33)\n\nAlso linked to COVID-19 were persistent cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding disorders, smell and taste disturbances, and malaise and fatigue.\n\nNevertheless, the incidence of these conditions remained uncommon in the post-COVID pediatric population, according to Lyudmyla Kompaniyets, PhD, health economist at the CDC in Atlanta, and colleagues reporting in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nStudy authors said their finding of elevated diabetes and myocarditis among children months after COVID is consistent with previous evidence, whereas the other observed risks appear to be novel in this population.\n\nNotably, the COVID patients had low rates of respiratory, mental health, neurological, muscle disorders, and sleeping disorders compared with the general population in this study.\n\n\"Reasons for these observed associations are likely multifactorial, and might be, in part, because patients without COVID-19 were selected from a cohort of patients with a health care encounter possibly related to COVID-19 and were less healthy than were patients with COVID-19 at baseline,\" the CDC group suggested.\n\nThe definition of post-COVID symptoms and conditions used by the authors was new, recurring, or ongoing health problems that occurred 4 or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe study was conducted using large medical claims databases in order to assess nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among children and adolescents.\n\nData were collected on 781,419 U.S. children and adolescents with COVID-19, who were matched 1:3 with peers with a healthcare encounter but no reported COVID-19 from March 2021 to January 2022. Participants were followed for a minimum of 60 days and a maximum of 365 days.\n\nThe cohort had a mean age of 12 years, and was evenly split between boys and girls.\n\nStatistical models were adjusted for age, sex, race, U.S. Census Bureau region, payor type, previous medical complexity, and previous hospitalization.\n\nKompaniyets and colleagues warned that their analysis of post-COVID symptoms and conditions was subject to misclassification bias and did not account for events that started before COVID infection. Whether the reported conditions were transient or chronic was not known.\n\nThere is also the possibility that some children may have had undocumented COVID-19, they acknowledged, adding that the 70% rate of patients being on Medicaid managed care limits the study's generalizability to all children and adolescents.\n\nFinally, vaccination status was not adjusted for in the study because of assumed underreporting in the dataset. Nonetheless, the CDC group maintained the importance of COVID vaccination in children and teenagers.\n\n\"COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible persons aged \u22656 months, are critical for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness and for reducing the public health impact of post-COVID symptoms and conditions,\" they wrote.\n\nJames Lopilato is a staff writer for Medpage Today.

        "link": "https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/longcovid/100092",
        "text": "In Norway, COVID survivors did not show progressive changes in cardiac structure and function that would explain persistent symptoms months later, a cohort study showed.\n\nFrom 3 to 12 months after hospitalization, echocardiography in 182 patients revealed no significant overall changes in any measures of left ventricular (LV) or right ventricular structure and function. This was despite over half of patients reporting dyspnea at 3 months, which largely persisted through 12 months.\n\nThe most frequent pathologies on echocardiography were:\n\nLow LV global longitudinal strain (19% at 3 months and 15% at 12 months, P=0.44)\n\nLow LV ejection fraction (16% and 14%, P=0.44)\n\nDiastolic dysfunction (13% and 17%, P=0.17)\n\nCardiac structure and function ultimately bore no relationship with shortness of breath. Furthermore, there was no significant change in arrhythmia burden between 3 and 12 months, reported Charlotte Ingul, MD, PhD, of Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, and colleagues of the PROLUN group. Their manuscript was published in Clinical Cardiology.\n\n\"Although we did not have pre\u2010COVID echocardiographic data on the participants, these findings suggest that there is limited long\u2010term cardiac remodeling and progressive dysfunction after hospitalization for COVID\u201019, and that cardiac recovery from the acute disease predominantly occurs within the first 3 months,\" the authors wrote.\n\nPrior studies have reported cardiac dysfunction in the acute phase of COVID illness. However, the long-term significance of a finding like diffuse fibrosis, myocardial edema, or myocardial scar is unclear.\n\nEven so, cardiac involvement long after SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's finding that incident heart failure (HF) increased by 45% after COVID hospitalization.\n\nAn author of that study, HF specialist Marat Fudim, MD, MHS, of Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, said he suspected this is driven by HF that is likely induced via a general deterioration of the cardiovascular and pulmonary state and makes itself apparent months to years later.\n\n\"How to square a relatively benign cardiac echocardiogram trend in the Norwegian study and repeat studies showing high HF incidence is that COVID is a multisystem disease and I suspect most of the harm is done outside the heart,\" Fudim told MedPage Today.\n\n\"Insults to the autonomic, pulmonary, and vascular system likely drive what we consider as long COVID. The heart might be more or less unharmed in those cases, yet patients suffer dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia,\" he said. \"Whether those cases can be all classified as HF or not I don't know.\"\n\nPROLUN was a prospective observational study conducted at six major hospitals in Norway. Participants were people who had been hospitalized with COVID\u201019 from February to June 2020.\n\nIncluded in the present analysis were those who underwent echocardiography 3 and 12 months after leaving the hospital. Due to limited capacity, 24-hour ECG monitoring at 12 months was limited to people who had an arrhythmia at 3 months.\n\nThe study cohort averaged 58 years old, and 59% were men. Mean BMI was 28.2. One in five had been hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness.\n\nIngul's group acknowledged that the observational study was subject to various biases. Moreover, data had been collected in the early days of the pandemic, when today's SARS-CoV-2 variants were not yet in circulation.\n\nNicole Lou is a reporter for MedPage Today, where she covers cardiology news and other developments in medicine.

        "title": "Faust Files: Paul Offit on His Vote Against Bivalent COVID Boosters",
        "link": "https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/faustfiles/100026",
        "text": "In the first part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, talks with Paul Offit, MD, about his recent decision to vote against the bivalent COVID-19 booster shot at a recent meeting of FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).\n\nOffit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe following is a transcript of their remarks:\n\nJeremy Faust, MD: Hello, I'm Jeremy Faust, medical editor-in-chief of MedPage Today. Thanks for joining us.\n\nToday we are joined by Dr. Paul Offit. He is a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, which is the committee that publicly discusses, and debates, and ultimately votes on recommendations related to the COVID-19 vaccines and their authorization for use.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nPaul Offit, MD: My pleasure.\n\nFaust: Let's start by talking about an article you wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, 'COVID-19 boosters -- where from here?' You argued, essentially, that these mRNA vaccines in particular were designed to do something very specific, which is to prevent severe disease and deaths, and that they happen to temporarily do what everyone else wants them to do, which is to decrease infections.\n\nIt seems to me that a lot of people are looking at boosters and they don't realize it, but they're treating them like they're almost prophylaxis, and I think that, in your view, is not a sustainable way to do things. How do you think this is going to play out?\n\nOffit: I think probably you can trace the confusion back to December of 2020.\n\nIn December of 2020, the FDA vaccine advisory committee was asked to consider both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Those were two-dose vaccines given 3 or 4 weeks apart, and protection against mild, moderate, and severe disease was 95%. Those vaccines were roughly 95% effective at preventing not only severe illness, but also mild illness.\n\nThen what happened was 6 months later, the CDC did studies showing that protection against severe disease holding up, which is good, but the protection against mild disease was fading -- as you would've guessed -- because protection against mild diseases, for the most part, is mediated by neutralizing antibodies present at the time of infection, and those faded.\n\nSo why was it 95% protection against mild disease in December of 2020? Those were 3-month studies. Those participants had just gotten their second dose. So therefore, you sort of had this unrealistic sense of what this was all about. That was the way it was handled, not only by the media, but I think in many ways by public health officials; officials who use words like 'fading immunity' or 'breakthrough infections' when you were seeing exactly what you would expect to see.\n\nEven 1 year later, when studies were done by Mark Tenforde out of the CDC, with just two doses you found that protection against severe disease was holding up.\n\nThen Omicron hit, which was an immune-evasive strain, and caused mild illness even in those who were vaccinated. I think this sort of led to a lot of confusion and ultimately led to a third dose and then to a fourth dose. And I think we used terms like 'fully vaccinated' as compared to 'fully vaccinated and up-to-date,' and I think it would be hard to find 10 Americans who would agree on what it means to be protected against this virus.\n\nFaust: I think that's fair. Now, I actually think this next question is sort of out of order, but I think it's important that we do it first. That is that you are, as I mentioned in the introduction, on the committee -- VRBPAC -- that looks at these questions of what we should do next and makes recommendations, and you voted against the bivalent booster. That is, using a booster that's got some of the old strain and some of the Omicron [strain] in it. You voted against that for the fall. I'd like you to talk us through your thought process and why you think that doing it your way would be better.\n\nOffit: The studies that were presented to us on June 28 of this year, 2022, by both Pfizer and Moderna were done the right way, which is to say they gave people three doses of the ancestral strain vaccine and then the fourth dose was either the ancestral strain vaccine or the fourth dose was a bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine in both cases, for Pfizer and Moderna, was the ancestral strain plus BA.1, the original Omicron strain. They then looked at the difference in those neutralizing antibody responses based on whether you got the ancestral boost or whether you got the bivalent boost.\n\nWhat they found was -- depending on how the study was done because Pfizer did 30 mcg or 60 mcg and Moderna did 25 mcg for the ancestral and then 25 mcg for the Omicron strain -- they found that the difference in neutralizing antibodies was either 1.5-fold greater against neutralizing antibodies for Omicron if you got the bivalent strains compared to if you just got the ancestral strain, or 1.75 greater, or 1.97 greater.\n\nThe implication was that that's good enough; that those statistically significant differences were also clinically significant differences, when we knew that back in December of 2020 -- when you looked at the neutralizing antibody differences between Moderna and Pfizer -- there was roughly a twofold greater neutralizing antibody response for Moderna than Pfizer, but that didn't really matter in terms of protection against severe illness.\n\nSo why were we making this difference of 1.5-fold or 1.97-fold greater with the Omicron boost than the ancestral boost? Why were we making that seem as if that was going to be the answer to all our problems? Plus, the BA.1 strain is essentially gone. It's been replaced by BA.5/BA.4 and now BA.2.12.1, which are just Omicron subvariants that are somewhat distant from BA.1.\n\nSo where this is settled out is that I think the [Biden] administration is interested in having a bivalent vaccine where one of the strains is the ancestral strain and the other strain is BA.5. And we'll see, but I certainly hope that before they launch that kind of program for the American public, they show clear evidence that there is a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies with BA.5 associated with that boost. Because remember, even with boosting the ancestral strain, you do get somewhat of a broadening of immune response as Linda Saif and coauthors showed in a New England Journal Medicine paper at the end of June.\n\nSo I think that's the burden that it should be held to because otherwise it's just marketing, right? Otherwise it's like, 'I'm going to give you BA.5 because BA.5 is circulating and therefore it's going to be better,' which theoretically makes sense, but you need to have clear evidence, preferably clinical data, but at the very least compelling immunological data.\n\nFaust: Now, would moving to a bivalent booster just in general be progress against this concern about 'imprinting or antigenic sin'? The idea is that whatever your body sees first, it will sort of narrowly respond to that. Therefore in the future, your body doesn't have as good of a response because of what it initially saw. Does giving bivalent anything actually have some benefit just on those grounds?\n\nOffit: Again, it should be proven, but the imprinting thing was originally defined by a researcher named Thomas Francis, who was working with influenza back in the 50s, and he used the term 'original antigenic sin.' The thinking was this, you can tell when children were born based on the way they respond to influenza -- either natural infection or immunization -- because they respond as if they're responding to that original infection. The original infection that they had when they were children, if they then get a vaccine or a secondary infection, they're responding as if they're responding to that first infection and not recognizing the subtle differences with that either vaccine or natural infection.\n\nThat's what you worry about here, that you sort of lock people into this response against the ancestral strain and don't have the chance then to have a broader response.\n\nI will say this though, the ancestral strain is the original strain. It's the Wuhan strain. The one that first raised its head in Wuhan in October/November 2019 has served us well. I mean, all the way through, even including Omicron and the Omicron subvariants, it does appear to continue to protect against serious illness, which is the goal of this vaccine. At least it was the stated goal of this vaccine, but I feel like we're drifting a little bit from protection against serious illness to trying to protect against all illness.\n\nAnd I would argue that there are some people who can't handle a mild illness. They can't handle it because they have severe heart disease or severe lung disease or because they have out of control diabetes or whatever, so when they get a mild or moderate infection they're more likely to develop a severe illness or because they're immune compromised.\n\nSo that's different. That's really not fading memory, it's someone who either never had a very good immune response because they're immune compromised or because of their age they don't make very good so-called cytotoxic T-cell responses, so they're not as able to crowd the infection and keep it as a mild or moderate infection. You could argue that that group may benefit from a boost, if you will, to keep neutralizing antibodies high, to the extent they can make neutralizing antibodies for a few months during the times when these viruses are at peak circulation, you could make that argument. But I think we're sort of not making that argument; we're making the argument of boosters for all. And first of all, I think people are a little weary of boosters at this point.\n\nFaust: Yeah. I mean, the way I'm looking at it is that people who, as you mentioned, have another risk factor for hospitalization probably need to stay what we'd call 'up-to-date' on their vaccine so that they don't encounter mild illness because mild illness has implications for them that they don't have for others. It's not that they'll get severe disease; severe COVID, it's that that mild illness will make something else severe. That's what we keep seeing, and the data are bearing this out. So, absolutely, I think saying up-to-date for older populations makes sense.\n\nI don't think the mRNA vaccines are optimized for this, but they're the best we've got, so that's what we're stuck with for now. But I agree with you that we could kind of spend all of our effort on that group and have huge benefits instead of diffusing the efforts, the money, the signal, for very little in return.\n\nAs I think about younger people, some younger people obviously really want doses. They've bought into this idea that these vaccines can eliminate infection. I think you and I agree on this, the benefit for boosting for young people is very transient, if any, but over time I think arguments have been made that say, 'OK, look, there's a lot of good reasons to boost younger people.'\n\nWhere do you stand right now? Do you still think that two doses of the ancestral vaccine is sufficient for most people, and have you softened on third doses for younger people? I guess the third question of this three-part is: who do you think right now needs more than two doses?\n\nOffit: I still would argue that for a healthy young person, two doses appears to continue to protect against severe illness. What that third dose does do though for Omicron, meaning BA.1 and the Omicron subvariants, is you do get an increased response against those variants and subvariants.\n\nThe question is, does it matter? Because still it looks like you're protected against severe illness, so does it really matter to get that third dose? I would argue 'no.' [But] I think that ship has sailed. I think this is now a three-dose vaccine for the most part, because that's the way the press and the public have handled it, it's the way public administrators have handled it.\n\nBut I still would argue, if you looked at that Mark Tenforde paper that was published in Infectious Diseases, what he did was he looked at two doses for 1 year, up through December of 2021 so the vaccine had been out for a year -- so you're looking through the D614G variant, the Alpha variant, and the Delta variant -- and what he found was that protection against serious illness was holding up. And this was for...80% of the people in that group had at least one comorbidity and a significant percentage were over [age] 65. So that was holding up pretty well.\n\nBut then Omicron hit, and we clearly have shown that three doses is better than two for Omicron in terms of preventing hospitalization. My question is: who are those people? And I think that's not everybody.\n\nI still think it would be helpful for the CDC to sort of sub-stratify that. To some extent they have; they've shown us that at least 75% of those who are getting hospitalized despite having two doses were in these high-risk groups that we just talked about. So focus on them. I think that is what makes the most sense to me.\n\nFaust: Yeah. If you look at the CDC's readouts -- I think we've discussed this before offline, but I'm not sure we've discussed it in public -- it's actually very difficult to tell the difference between a person who got their second dose a year ago and a person who got their third dose a year ago. So the idea of the three-dose vaccine kind of only makes sense in that in the period of time for which a third dose increases those neutralizing antibodies.\n\nSo yes, you could tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose, but you also can't tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose and someone who just got their second dose. What really matters is how far are you out from your most recent dose, and I think that the public is basically not going to keep doing this except for high-risk groups. Is that a fair read?\n\nOffit: Very fair. And I think when we compare vaccinated to unvaccinated or got a two-dose versus three-dose you need to also account for who has gotten naturally infected in the meantime, because that does alter things. And it is knowable, I mean, you can know that by looking at say antibodies against, say, the nuclear protein, which is only going to happen if you've been naturally infected. So I think that also is one of the problems -- controlling for natural infection, which now is common.\n\nI remember when a couple months into this pandemic, Jon Yewdell, who was the head of virus research at the National Institutes of Health, said 3 years from now you're going to have two choices: be naturally affected or be vaccinated.\n\nIf you look at some of these recent seroprevalence studies, there was one in JAMA recently, showing that as many as 90% of people have either been naturally infected or vaccinated when they look at the thousands and thousands of lots of people who have donated blood. Now, that's limited by who chooses to donate blood, but I still think it is striking.\n\nFaust: Right. And I think maybe a cognitive shift that I made at some point was that you might not necessarily choose between infection or vaccination, but you have to choose infection with protection or infection without protection. In other words, you walk into that infection or that exposure with a vaccine on board or not, and you want to do that, obviously.\n\nI want to make sure that we don't make incorrect news here. You said that you think it's a three-dose vaccine, but you said that because you think that basically the scientific debate is over because no one is having it. Not because of science support stuff but basically due to marketing, is that correct?\n\nOffit: Yeah. I just got an email today from a mother of a college student who was upset that her child can't go to a certain East Coast school because he hasn't had his third dose. She argues reasonably -- he's a healthy young person, he's gotten two doses, he's a boy who is in an age range where he is at some risk for myocarditis, and I don't think the benefits outweigh the risks here. A perfectly reasonable argument. I agree. I agree with her.\n\nFaust: But I also think that, as my friend Carter Mecher pointed out to me when we discussed this like a year ago, that most people who get a third dose, even in that group of a young, healthy male, most people will be happy with their decision to get a third dose because for 99% it makes no difference. For a small, tiny group it would help; for a small, tiny group it would hurt.\n\nSo most people would just be happy with their decision because whatever they did, they think, 'Well, I got a third dose. I did my best.' Therefore the administration is saying, 'Well, look, if it breaks even we might as well just make everybody happy.'\n\nOffit: Yeah. There was an old study that was done at a Canadian racetrack where they asked people to rate their horse while they were on the way up to making the bet, then they asked a different group of people to rate their horse after they'd already made the bet. Obviously, after you already made the bet, you rated it much higher.\n\nBut what I loved about that article was the title, which was \"Post-decision dissonance at post time.\"\n\nFaust: Right. Post-vax something or other -- we could do it with that.\n\nThe mix and match, the idea of starting with one formulation of Pfizer and then boosting with Moderna, do you think it matters? Certainly, it has a little bit more of an antibody response and more side effects, but on a population level do you think it matters? If someone asks you, 'What should I do?,' what do you tell them?\n\nOffit: Wait for data. I mean, it is interesting to see some of these early reports now of boosting with Novavax, which is a purified protein vaccine that's adjuvanted with the same adjuvant that's used in Shingrix, which is an exceptional vaccine.\n\nIf you've already gotten, say, two doses or three doses of an mRNA vaccine and then you get this dose of Nova, the antibody studies, at least the small ones that have been reported so far, look promising.\n\nBut again, you ultimately need clinical data, and hopefully the CDC can help generate those data.\n\nEmily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today.

        "link": "https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/100016",
        "text": "In the early days of the pandemic there was an understandable rush to define and optimally treat COVID-19. Anecdotal evidence and the opinions of eminent scientists and non-scientists overwhelmed social and mainstream media platforms only to eventually be overruled by the results of careful, scientific analyses and well-designed clinical trials. Now, more than 2 years into the pandemic, we must return to the standard of careful and thorough analyses for all interventions and treatments.\n\nThe debate about \"COVID-19 rebound\" after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) treatment is one of these timely areas warranting further investigation. Continuing down the current path of uncertainty has consequences for how and by whom this antiviral should be used. However, by applying lessons learned from the early days of the pandemic -- including acknowledging the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) -- we can avoid repeating the same mistakes. To do this, it is necessary to start by defining the question, identifying current knowledge gaps, and only then can one propose scientific solutions to bring a rapid resolution to the COVID-19 rebound controversy.\n\nThe Need for a Sound Definition Before Studying COVID-19 Rebound\n\nPaxlovid consists of two drugs: nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibiting viral replication, and ritonavir, which slows the inactivation and breakdown of nirmatrelvir. Per a CDC health advisory released in May, COVID-19 rebound is defined as a return of symptoms or a \"new positive viral test after having tested negative\" occurring \"2 to 8 days after initial recovery.\" We just saw this over the weekend in the case of President Biden.\n\nThis definition of rebound is challenging and prone to inflating the incidence of rebound. It is possible some individuals identified as having \"Paxlovid rebound\" may have been experiencing a waxing and waning of COVID-19 symptoms while some unknown number of other reported rebound cases could be due to the known limitations of COVID-19 testing.\n\nFirst, infectious disease specialists have long witnessed that some respiratory illnesses can have a bimodal course. This phenomenon has been reported in patients with COVID-19, albeit best described in hospitalized patients with more severe disease. Additionally, secondary bacterial infections (e.g., sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) have been known to occur after COVID-19, which could also be misidentified as COVID-19 rebound.\n\nSecond, COVID-19 antigen testing -- a convenient diagnostic tool -- does have limitations. It is plausible, for example, that some individuals, after getting COVID-19 and completing a course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, initially get a false negative test (especially if they have a low viral load); then, after testing again out of precaution a few days later, could get a positive result due to viable or dead viruses -- an antigen test cannot distinguish between them. Finally, some patients who have clinically recovered will continue with positive PCR COVID-19 testing for several weeks, which could explain some of the anecdotal reports of COVID-19 rebound.\n\nThird, recall bias is another challenge to defining COVID-19 rebound and its incidence. It is a well-known phenomenon that patients who receive a particular therapy are more likely to report side effects or symptoms during their clinical course compared to individuals who are not treated. Thus, the problem of identifying cases of COVID-19 rebound solely based on observational or anecdotal reports, and not as part of a controlled trial, is that the number of cases may be falsely increased.\n\nFew Studies Specifically Describe Paxlovid Rebound\n\nThe data supporting the existence of COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment is limited. Most studies were conducted prior to the emergence of Omicron and employ a retrospective design prone to various biases. Nonetheless, the data suggest the rebound phenomenon may occur in only a small number of high-risk patients and the findings to date don't offer sufficient evidence that it is definitely a result of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.\n\nA secondary analysis of the EPIC-HF trial (the basis for the antiviral's authorization) revealed that approximately 1% to 2% of all unvaccinated individuals (treated and untreated) tested positive after having a negative test. And a recently published study showed that COVID-19 rebound occurred in only four of 483 (0.8%) vaccinated, high-risk patients. The incidence of rebound among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients infected with the Omicron variant is unknown.\n\nThere are three notable, albeit small, case reports recently published in the medical literature regarding COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. One non-peer-reviewed study describes 10 patients who experienced a relapse of symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 viral load following treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The authors identified two instances of transmission during relapse. The second report, also not yet peer-reviewed, describes a single patient who experienced the return of symptoms and had culturable virus 5 days after completing a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir course. Because nirmatrelvir/ritonavir viral resistance was not noted nor did the patient demonstrate an absence of neutralizing antibodies, this raises the question of whether rebound could be a function of drug level in the individual's blood (while the dosage in the antiviral pill is consistent, not everyone absorbs the same amount or metabolizes it the same way). The third and most recent study has been peer-reviewed and describes a series of seven patients who experienced COVID-19 rebound, six of whom had recurrence of symptoms and one who was asymptomatic but had a repeat positive antigen test. While also limited in size, this study supports the findings of the previous two studies: three of the seven patients had culturable virus, suggesting that patients who experience COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be infectious. However, there is no defined level of culturable virus that can identify patients who remain infectious/contagious. And fortunately, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 virus from six of the seven patients did not identify any known antiviral resistant mutations.\n\nStudies That Could Shed Light on Paxlovid Rebound\n\nThe EPIC-SR trial enrolled 1,553 individuals between August 2021 and December 2021 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a standard risk of progressing to severe disease. Pfizer has shared some of these results; however, these press releases have not mentioned COVID-19 rebound.\n\nAnother study, the PANORAMIC trial, is currently enrolling high-risk outpatients in the U.K., but like the EPIC-SR trial, it is unclear if rebound is among the study outcomes.\n\nTogether, these studies have the potential to both further define and report the incidence of rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. If these data were collected from the EPIC-SR trial then it should be released. And if the PANORAMIC trial is not already designed to identify cases of rebound, then the protocol should be amended accordingly.\n\nOnly an RCT Can Definitively Answer the Question of Paxlovid Rebound\n\nWhether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is associated with COVID-19 rebound and how often this occurs can only be determined by a prospective double-blind RCT. The basis for the standard of care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was largely defined by the results of large RCTs that meticulously detailed adverse events. In a similar fashion, an RCT performed with individuals at low risk for progression to severe disease who have been vaccinated or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 need to be randomized to placebo or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and then followed closely for rebound by evaluating symptoms, signs, and serial collection of both molecular tests and viral cultures, in conjunction with monitoring of close contacts to determine whether this is transmissible. This will define more precisely the rebound prevalence, clinical consequences, and infectiousness rates. One could also test to see if there is any benefit to treating rebound with an additional course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Despite reports of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir being prescribed to treat rebound, the CDC is not currently recommending this approach.\n\nWithout such a scientifically rigorous study, uncertainty will persist at a dire cost. Not knowing who best benefits from nirmatrelvir/ritonavir can result in its overuse, more drug-induced side effects, and the development of viral resistance. Additionally, some individuals who would benefit from nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be hesitant to be treated because of the perceived risk of COVID-19 rebound. On the other hand, if COVID-19 rebound does occur due to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, then it is important to know the incidence, clinical, and microbiologic course, and whether additional treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is warranted.\n\nOnce again, the pandemic reminds us to hurry but not rush to judgement, to conduct well-designed clinical trials, and to learn from the results to improve patient care.\n\nDaniel A.

We know inflammation is part of the neurodegenerative process in diseases like Alzheimer's.\"\n\n\"With other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, there have been similar associations between infection and cognition, but there are still big questions about cause and effect,\" Sexton pointed out.\n\nThe Argentina study followed 865 people over age 60 recruited from a provincial health registry that included all SARS-CoV-2 testing data for the region. Researchers randomly invited older adults with a positive PCR COVID test to participate between 3 and 6 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAssessments followed the recommendations of the global consortium and included the WHO Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) scale, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, neurocognitive and emotional reactivity assessments, and evaluations of semi-quantitative olfactory function, motor function, coordination, and gait.\n\nAmong the 865 participants, 84.2% had COVID and 15.8% were controls with no history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Median age was 67 and just more than half (56.5%) were female. Participants had a median of 10.35 years of education. Most participants with COVID did not have severe infection, with very few (2% or less) admitted to the ICU.\n\nAt 1 year, about one-fourth of the study sample had no cognitive impairment; this group included control participants and about 20% of post-COVID patients, Gonzalez-Aleman said. Scores of remaining participants were normalized to the mean of the cognitively normal group, with impairment defined as z-scores below -2. Remaining participants were clustered into groups based on deficits in memory, attention, executive function, and language, with some people showing impairment in multiple domains.\n\nPCR status and age predicted post-COVID cognitive problems, Gonzalez-Aleman said. Logistic regression analyses showed severity of anosmia, but not severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was significantly associated with cognitive impairment.\n\nAll anosmia was reported after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Gonzalez-Aleman noted. Some people in the control group also had anosmia, but their olfactory dysfunction was much less frequent -- and less severe -- than that of participants with COVID, she added.\n\nThe results are part of ongoing research about COVID among older Amerindian adults in Argentina. \"It's important to provide the most up-to-date research to the public so we can be aware of the evolving ways this virus impacts us,\" Sexton said.\n\n\"But it's also worth stressing that much more research is needed to paint a more complete picture of what COVID-19 is doing to our bodies and brains,\" she added. \"We also need to study the direct impact that 2 years of pandemic-related isolation has had on our health.\"\n\nJudy George covers neurology and neuroscience news for MedPage Today, writing about brain aging, Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, MS, rare diseases, epilepsy, autism, headache, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s, ALS, concussion, CTE, sleep, pain, and more.

In areas such as oncology, immunology, and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases, it has opened new insights into the interplay between different cellular actors in promoting or suppressing disease. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a group 1 carcinogen, is a causative factor for nine different cancers that cause roughly 165,000 deaths globally each year. EBV is asymptomatically carried among almost all adults, with the virus persisting primarily in rare memory B cells. However, in some infected individuals, EBV is associated with the development of cancer. The immune microenvironment in which infected cells reside may influence or trigger cancer development, but it is still unknown how this occurs.\n\nThis webinar will address how spatial phenotyping is uniquely suited to outline one of the putative causative relationships between EBV infections, immunosuppression, and cancer.\n\n\n\nDuring this webinar, viewers will:\n\nLearn how a meticulously designed and highly specific antibody panel provides the sensitivity and specificity required to characterize Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\n\nBe presented with a framework that associates specific EBV expression profiles with a unique tissue architecture and immune infiltrate\n\nDiscover how end-to-end analysis pipelines are used to examine high-dimensional spatial data\n\nUncover how cellular neighborhood analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides unbiased analysis of tissue microenvironments.\n\nThis webinar will last for approximately 60 minutes."

        "text": "Harald Walach\n\nWhen a retracted paper is republished in a new journal, should it note the retraction?\n\nA few readers have asked us that question as they forwarded a paper published in May in Environmental Research, an Elsevier title. The study, \u201cCarbon dioxide rises beyond acceptable safety levels in children under nose and mouth covering: Results of an experimental measurement study in healthy children,\u201d bore striking similarities to a paper by the same authors that was retracted from JAMA Pediatrics in July 2021.\n\nThat retraction was the second for the paper\u2019s first author, Harald Walach, who also lost an affiliation with a university in Poland. Walach tells us that he let the editor know about the JAMA Pediatrics retraction before he submitted the manuscript:\n\nI think the retraction was politically motivated and did not find any true fault in the paper. I have, of course, notified the editor, before submitting it that it had been retracted and explained in my pre-inquiry why I think that the retraction was void and flawed. Following this the editor invited me to submit the paper in the full version and then submitted it to a new review sending it out to three indepenedent experts, who, of course, knew about its history and found it valid. I changed various details and added some clarifications during the publication process, which is, why the final published paper is considerably longer and contains some more details that had neither been contained in the long version that was published as a preprint nor in the supplemental material, for instance the back to the envelope calculations that show that our measures are well in agreement with those calculated from expected versions, as is done with capnography. This shows: our paper was valid all along, the retraction was flawed and pointless, and the publication which is available now is a valid rendering of our findings.\n\nWhen we asked Jose L. Domingo, one of the editors in chief of Environmental Research, whether the authors had told the journal that the paper had been retracted, he originally said no, and that had the editors known, they probably wouldn\u2019t have sent it out for peer review.\n\nBut when he checked with an associate editor, he said he\u2019d been mistaken.

If the paper is deemed valid, as it obviously was following the review process, a note that it is a formerly retracted paper that was published by JAMA Ped would only cast a bad light on the journal it was retracted from. Having edited a journal for Karger for more than 20 years I know from my own experience that publishers would normally refrain from such information as one would not want to tarnish another journal.

        "text": "via CDC\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking retractions of papers about COVID-19 as part of our database. Here\u2019s a running list, which will be updated as needed. (For some context on these figures, see this post, our letter in Accountability in Research and the last section of this Nature news article. Also see a note about the terminology regarding preprint servers at the end.)\n\nRetracted\n\nExpressions of concern\n\nNote: Retraction Watch does not draw a distinction between withdrawal and retraction, because journals that have done so have typically done it to justify not saying anything about why a paper was retracted, and to sometimes make a paper disappear without a trace. Richard Sever, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, asked that we include a comment from him about how the processes for withdrawing preprints and retracting journal articles may differ: Journals may retract a paper at the authors\u2019 request and/or if the editors identify fundamental flaws that would have precluded acceptance if spotted during review. [RW: Note that some journals insist that they cannot make such moves without authors\u2019 permission.] A preprint is usually withdrawn only at an authors\u2019 request. A preprint server will not typically withdraw a flawed preprint against the wishes of the author, since the server made no claim to have peer-reviewed and certified the scientific content in the first place. At the same time, preprint servers *will* withdraw a preprint against the authors\u2019 wishes in instances of fraud, ethics violations, dangerous material, or legal issues. It is thus the nature of preprints that there will be some that contain errors but are not withdrawn and would not appear in the above list. [RW: The same is, of course, true of some papers in peer-reviewed journals.]\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

In light of this concern, Johns Hopkins Medicine will continue to develop new ways to reach all populations \u2014 with specific consideration for vulnerable ones \u2014 to provide access to essential COVID-19 information and services. These include testing, care options, potential therapies, best practices to prevent the spread of illness, emotional support resources, language access options, and much more.\n\nWith highly effective vaccines now available to us in accordance with government supply distribution, we are focused on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for eligible populations. To help achieve this, Johns Hopkins Medicine has mobilized a multidisciplinary task force specifically focused on vaccine distribution, with equity and inclusion built into its foundation.\n\nThrough this task force, we continue to reach out to all of our patients, our neighboring communities and our personnel in many ways:\n\nMyChart (available in English and Spanish.) is a secure website that provides your up-to-date medical information available to you about your care and your health care team.\n\nEfforts to Reach Our Patients\n\nAs government agencies continue to open vaccine eligibility to certain demographic groups, Johns Hopkins Medicine offers our patients information and access to resources through the MyChart electronic health record system, direct emails, our website, video content, social media, as well as through our health care providers and other referring physicians. Importantly, we ensure that we can reach our patients who may have limited computer or broadband access by providing a dedicated telephone call center that notifies patients of vaccine appointment availability. We also share information through local news and media outlets, as well as by sharing resources through community partner programs. We are committed to ensuring that our patients who want to be vaccinated receive the information they need \u2014 and, ultimately, the vaccine, as our supply allocations allow.\n\nRead more about efforts to reach our patients\n\nOutreach to Our Neighboring Communities\n\nJohns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center opened a drive-through testing site for COVID-19 patient referrals and other identified priority groups.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine also has various partnerships and programs in place to reach our neighbors in nearby communities. For example, our Maryland and Washington, D.C., providers continue to collaborate with local governments to help vaccinate specific groups, such as public school employees. In addition, we are going onsite to various senior housing facilities to vaccinate these highly vulnerable residents where they live. We are also working closely with the University of Maryland Medical System to operate the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital, which offers COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy, vaccinations, as well as clinical care.\n\nIn addition, we have mobilized teams that are going out into the community to provide services, including testing and vaccinations within neighborhoods that have had high numbers of COVID-19 illnesses. In a collaborative effort between the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity, Johns Hopkins Medicine Language Services, and Centro Sol, a new pilot program \u2014 called Juntos \u2014 has helped to provide equitable resources to our Spanish-speaking inpatients with COVID-19. We are also leveraging well-established relationships with community and faith-based organizations to disseminate information about the vaccine.\n\nRead more about our outreach to neighboring communities\n\nConnecting with Our Personnel\n\nIncident Command Center\n\nAdditionally, our health care systemwide Incident Command Center and our diversity councils are collaborating to reach our personnel across their various roles within the health care system to ensure that they have all the vaccine information and access they need. Just as with our patients, we are leveraging MyChart for vaccine appointment scheduling and notifications. To further enable this, we have established MyChart activation and support stations in our hospitals to ensure that those personnel whose work is not computer-based will receive assistance with securing appointments.\n\nWe have also established a special telephone line for personnel who lack computer access or who may experience technology challenges with accessing a vaccine appointment. Knowing that different personnel receive information in different ways, we have developed multiple means of communication \u2014 including signs, videos, infographics and a dedicated internal website, among other things \u2014 to help provide critical information to our staff.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we remain focused on creating effective and meaningful programs to ensure that our personnel, patients and neighboring communities feel they have the information and access they need to COVID-19 resources to remain informed and healthy.\n\nFor more information about COVID-19 and important resources.

The report also indicates plans for continued/increased funding for antimicrobial resistance (AR) training and testing programs, such as the AR Solutions Initiative and the AR Lab Network, which were also utilized against the pandemic and for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\nIn the press release announcing the new report, Denise Cardo, MD, director of CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, emphasized the importance of expanding on effective prevention strategies already underway.\n\n\"The 2021 launch of the Global AR Lab and Response Network and the Global Action in Health Network is an example of how aggressively CDC is moving to combat antimicrobial resistance not only in the US, but in nearly 50 countries across the world.We made significant progress before the pandemic, and I'm confident that we will make significant progress going forward,\" Cardo said.\n\nAdditional measures that are anticipated in the report include:"

And this certainly applies to COVID-19. Aethlon Medical has developed its Hemopurifier, which is a therapeutic device designed for the single use depletion of circulating viruses and exosomes from the blood.\n\nThe San Diego, Calif.,-based medical technology company has been focusing on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. Specifically, when it comes to COVID-19, the company performed an in vitro study with its Hemopurifier, that was published in bioRxiv.\n\nIn their study, known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were passed 3 times over columns containing 1 gram of Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin. The percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. Extrapolation of these data would indicate that the binding capacity of the Hemopurifier for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection would be more than sufficient.\n\nThe Hemopurifier holds a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough device designation related to life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. In June 2020, the FDA approved an amendment to Aethlon's existing open IDE for the Hemopurifier in life threatening viral infections, to allow for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. This will allow for up to 40 of these patients to be treated under a new Early Feasibility Study protocol at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States.\n\nContagion recently spoke to Aethlon CEO Charles Fisher, Jr., MD, and Aethlon CMO Steven LaRosa, MD, who were the study\u2019s lead author and coauthor respectively.

        "text": "\n\nA new study from the Netherlands shows the lingering effects of COVID-19. According to a large Dutch study published in The Lancet, 1 in 8 adults who are infected with virus feel long term symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe study comes from data gathered within Lifelines, a multidisciplinary, prospective, population-based, observational cohort study examining the health and health-related behaviors of people living in the north portion of the Netherlands.\n\nThe participants were 18 years of age or older. They were sent invitations to digital COVID-19 questionnaires, used longitudinal dynamics of 23 somatic symptoms surrounding COVID-19 diagnoses (due to SARS-CoV-2 alpha [B.1.1.7] variant or previous variants) were assessed using 24 repeated measurements between March 31, 2020, and Aug 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is urgent need for data informing the scale and scope of the long-term symptoms experienced by some patients after COVID-19 illness,\u201d Professor Judith Rosmalen from the University of Groningen, lead author of the study, said. \u201cHowever, most previous research into long COVID has not looked at the frequency of these symptoms in people who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with COVID-19 or looked at individual patients\u2019 symptoms before the diagnosis of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven after the acute virus has dissipated, some patients still feel the lingering effects of COVID-19 several months after first becoming infected. In fact, the investigators discovered that several symptoms were new or more severe 3 to 5 months after having COVID-19, compared to symptoms before a COVID-19 diagnosis and to the control group, suggesting these symptoms can be viewed as the core symptoms of long COVID.\n\n\n\nCore symptoms recorded were chest pain, difficulties breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and/or smell, tingling hands/feet, a lump in throat, alternately feeling hot and cold, heavy arms and/or legs and general tiredness. The severity of these symptoms plateaued at 3 months after infection with no further decline. Other symptoms that did not significantly increased 3 to 5 months after a COVID-19 diagnosis included headache, itchy eyes, dizziness, back pain and nausea.\n\nOf the study participants who had submitted pre-COVID symptom data, the investigators found that 21.4% (381/1,782) of COVID-19-positive participants, compared to 8.7% (361/4,130) of the control group, experienced at least one increased core symptom at moderate severity 3 months or more after SARs-CoV-2 infection. This implies that in 12.7% of COVID-19 patients their new or severely increased symptoms three months post-COVID can be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty,\u201d Aranka Ballering PhD candidate and first author of the study, said.\n\n\n\nSome of the limitations of the study included patients infected with the Alpha variant or earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 and has no data from people infected during the period when the Delta or Omicron variants were causing most infections. Additionally, due to asymptomatic infection, the prevalence of COVID-19 in this study may be underestimated.\n\n\n\nAnother limitation to this study is that since the beginning of data collection other symptoms, such as brain-fog, have been identified as potentially relevant for a definition of long COVID but this study did not look at these symptoms. Furthermore, the study was undertaken in one region and did not include and ethnically diverse population.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "Welcome back to Contagion\u2019s new podcast, Contagion Community, where we delve into some of the social factors that create and widen healthcare disparities.\n\nThis Pride month, Contagion Community is highlighting the healthcare needs and disparities unique to the LQBTQ+ community. Joining us for June\u2019s podcast are Steven Wolfe, DO, MPH, and Stuart A Fisk, CRNP, of the Allegheny Health Network (AHN).\n\nFisk and Wolfe work with LGBTQ people who are living with HIV. In this episode, they delve into the intersectionality of the disease, emphasizing that HIV prevention and treatment is especially needed for transgender people of color.\n\nWolfe and Fisk both identify as gay men, and thus have a personal as well as professional stake in ensuring LGBTQ+ people have access to comprehensive healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe need more physicians, like myself, out there who really understand what the community\u2019s needs are,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nAsked about the current state of the HIV epidemic, Wolfe said, \u201c62% of people who are trans and Black have HIV\u2026I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but I think that we need a lot more work when we\u2019re thinking about the minority populations.\u201d\n\nFisk added that 25-30% of people newly diagnosed with HIV are being diagnosed at the end stages of the disease. \u201cWe do not test people routinely for HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have the biomedical ability to end a pandemic as tragic as this one, and not do it because we\u2019re failing to give people a $2 test, is really a bad thing.\u201d\n\nBesides testing, Wolfe said pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another HIV preventative measure that is vastly underutilized. Wolfe cited study data suggesting 96% of transgender women were aware of PrEP, \u201cbut the reality of it is only 32% of transgender women were actually using PrEP to prevent HIV. That\u2019s a huge gap.\u201d\n\nFisk pointed out that similar disparities exist for injection drug users, who are at high risk of getting HIV but are \u201crarely if ever\u201d offered PrEP. \u201cPeople of color in general who have risk of HIV acquisition are typically not being offered PrEP or do not take PrEP.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is that HIV carries the stigma of the populations that it most impacts,\u201d Fisk said, noting that our society\u2019s criminalization of queerness, homelessness, and injection drug usage exacerbates HIV disease disparities. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nFisk has been working with marginalized people since the beginning of his nursing career, which he says has helped him become a better healthcare provider and a better human.\n\nWolfe noted that caring for people living with HIV is often not only about providing healthcare, but also mitigating the stigma these patients may have experienced throughout their lives. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe experts emphasized that HIV and LGBTQ+ healthcare should not be seen as specialized care. \u201cThis is care that should be integrated with regular primary care,\u201d Fisk said, with Wolfe adding, \u201cA transgender person should not have to go to an endocrinologist to get their hormones.\u201d\n\nAllegheny Health Network\u2019s Positive Health Clinic has 3 different locations in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania.

        "text": "At more than 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant advances in treatment and prevention options. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is highly effective against severe disease and death, but highly infectious variants like Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are causing breakthrough infections, leading cases to rise once again.\n\nTo prevent older or otherwise immunocompromised people from severe or fatal infection, Synairgen is developing SNG001, an inhalable COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized persons.\n\nDr. Phillip Monk, the Chief Scientific Officer at Synairgen, joined Contagion to discuss the SNG001 trial data Synairgen presented at the American Thoracic Society 2022 International Conference, held in San Francisco last month.\n\nSNG001 is a formulation of Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), a naturally occurring protein that catalyzes the body\u2019s antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses this protein, so the inhalable IFN-\u03b2 directly targets the lungs, the primary site of the COVID-19 viral reservoir.\n\nSNG001 may retain some efficacy against the Omicron variant. As a host-directed antiviral, Monk says, SNG001 has \u201cbroad spectrum antiviral potential.\u201d \u201cWe have in the lab actually shown the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 against Omicron as we have against other variants\u201d\n\nThe phase 3 SPRINTER trial (SG018; NCT04732949) was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study. The trial evaluated inhaled SNG001 to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen. SPRINTER included 624 participants, randomly assigned to either SNG001 (n = 309) or placebo (n = 314) in addition to standard of care.\n\nIn February 2022, Synairgen announced that SPRINTER did not meet its primary endpoints of hospital discharge and illness recovery. Monk says that this can be partially attributed to the standard-of-care COVID-19 treatments improving so much that SNG001 had to demonstrate a greater significance of disease reduction. \u201cBecause patients are doing so much better, it\u2019s much more difficult to show treatment effect on things like hospital discharge,\u201d Mock explained.\n\nDespite the efficacy of vaccines and other antivirals, there are still COVID-19 mortalities. Monk says over 2000 patients are being hospitalized in the US each day, and about 200 people a day are dying of COVID-19.\n\nAmong the trial participants given SNG001, there was a signal in reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe disease or death within 35 days. Monk said that the greatest treatment benefits were observed in older patients, patients with comorbidities, and especially in people who had poor respiratory function at baseline.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are having to breathe faster or have low oxygen saturation despite being on oxygen,\u201d Monk said, noting that this treatment population saw a relative risk reduction of 70% for severe disease."

        "text": "Background\n\nVaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID-19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death.\n\nWhat was our aim?\n\nWe wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.\n\nOnce we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.\n\nA majority of studies were conducted in English-speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at-risk patients, or the general population.\n\nFor an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID-19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower-middle-income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake."

        "link": "https://www.cochrane.org/CD013705/INFECTN_how-accurate-are-rapid-antigen-tests-diagnosing-covid-19",
        "text": "Key messages\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected.\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests.\n\nWhat are rapid point-of-care antigen tests for COVID-19?\n\nRapid point-of-care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection in people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. They:\n\n\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point-of-care) or in non-healthcare settings such as in the home;\n\n\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps;\n\n\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\n\n\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\n\n\u2022 provide results \u2018while you wait\u2019.\n\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \u2018lateral flow tests\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests.\n\nWhy is this question important?\n\nPeople with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result.\n\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID-19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point-of-care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe.\n\nMain results\n\nIn people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests).\n\nIn people who did not have COVID-19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms.\n\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \u2018acceptable\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID-19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms.\n\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID-19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID-19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT-PCR result as evidence of no COVID-19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT-PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT-PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT-PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self-isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people - individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected.\n\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID-19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non-healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021."

        "text": "Key messages\n\n\u2022 The antibiotic azithromycin is not an effective treatment for COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t know whether antibiotics other than azithromycin are effective treatments for COVID-19 because there is not enough research.\n\n\u2022 We found 19 ongoing studies that are investigating antibiotics for COVID-19. We will update this review if their results change our conclusions.\n\nWhat are antibiotics?\n\nAntibiotics are cheap and common medicines used to treat bacterial infections. However, recent laboratory studies found that some antibiotics slowed the reproduction of some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In laboratory tests, one antibiotic, azithromycin, reduced viral activity and inflammation, and so it has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We need good evidence before giving antibiotics for COVID-19 because overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, where organisms that cause infection change, so that antibiotics stop working.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on:\n\n\u2022 people dying;\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;\n\n\u2022 unwanted effects;\n\n\u2022 heart rhythm problems;\n\n\u2022 quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients.\n\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only.\n\nSeven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment.\n\nWe found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published.\n\nMain results\n\nInpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19\n\nAzithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people).\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not:\n\n\u2022 worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or\n\n\u2022 improve patients\u2019 condition (3 studies, 8172 people);\n\n\u2022 increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people).\n\nAzithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people).\n\nNo studies looked at quality of life.\n\nOutpatients with mild COVID-19\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2022 people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people);\n\n\u2022 whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people).\n\nWe don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants).\n\nNo studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021."

The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited.\n\nEvaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.\n\nWhat is ivermectin?\n\nIvermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.\n\nMedical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone.

Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo.\n\nFor treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.\n\nNo trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWe also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published.\n\nMain results\n\nTreating people in hospital with COVID-19\n\nWe do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment:\n\n\u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people);\n\n\u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);\n\n\u2013 increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).\n\nSeven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care.\n\nTreating outpatients with COVID-19\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);\n\n\u2013 serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants);\n\n\u2013 improving people's COVID\u201019 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);\n\n\u2013 number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021.

        "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (Aug. 8, 2022) \u2013 Fatigue and headache were the most common symptoms reported by individuals an average of more than four months out from having COVID-19, investigators report.\n\nMuscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion were next in the long line of lingering symptoms.\n\n\u201cOur results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infections,\u201d Medical College of Georgia investigators write in the journal ScienceDirect.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of symptoms that we did not know early on in the pandemic what to make of them, but now it\u2019s clear there is a long COVID syndrome and that a lot of people are affected,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Rutkowski, MCG neurologist and the study\u2019s corresponding author.\n\nThe published study reports on preliminary findings from the first visit of the first 200 patients enrolled in the COVID-19 Neurological and Molecular Prospective Cohort Study in Georgia, or CONGA, who were recruited on average about 125 days after testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nCONGA was established at MCG early in the pandemic in 2020 to examine the severity and longevity of neurological problems and began enrolling participants in March 2020 with the ultimate goal of recruiting 500 over five years.\n\nEighty percent of the first 200 participants reported neurological symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5%, and headache close behind at 66.5%. Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5%) and taste (54%) and nearly half the participants (47%) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, with 30% demonstrating impaired vocabulary and 32% having impaired working memory.\n\nTwenty-one percent reported confusion, and hypertension was the most common medical condition reported by participants in addition to their bout with COVID-19.\n\nNo participants reported having a stroke, weakness or inability to control muscles involved with speaking, and coordination problems were some of the less frequently reported symptoms.\n\nTwenty-five percent met the criteria for depression, and diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and a history of depression were associated with those who met the criteria. Anemia and a history of depression were associated with the 18% who met the objective criteria for anxiety.\n\nWhile the findings to date are not surprising and are consistent with what other investigators are finding, Rutkowski says the fact that symptoms reported by participants often didn\u2019t match what objective testing indicated, was surprising. And, it was bidirectional.\n\nFor example, the majority of participants reported taste and smell changes, but objective testing of both these senses did not always line up with what they reported. In fact, a higher percentage of those who did not report the changes actually had evidence of impaired function based on objective measures, the investigators write. While the reasons are not certain, part of the discrepancy may be a change in the quality of their taste and smell rather than pure impaired ability, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThey eat a chicken sandwich and it tastes like smoke or candles or some weird other thing but our taste strips are trying to depict specific tastes like salty and sweet,\u201d Rutkowski says. Others, for example, may rely on these senses more, even when they are preparing the food, and may be apt to notice even a slight change, she says.\n\nEither way, their data and others suggest a persistent loss of taste and smell following COVID-19, Rutkowski and her colleagues write.\n\nMany earlier reports have been based on these kinds of self-reports, and the discrepancies they are finding indicate that approach may not reflect objective dysfunction, the investigators write.\n\nOn the other hand, cognitive testing may overestimate impairment in disadvantaged populations, they report.\n\nThe first enrollees were largely female, 35.5% were male. They were an average of 44.6 years old, nearly 40% were Black and 7% had been hospitalized because of COVID-19. Black participants were generally disproportionately affected, the investigators say.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Black participants and 23.4% of white participants met criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The findings likely indicate that cognitive tests assess different ethnic groups differently. And, socioeconomic, psychosocial (issues like family problems, depression and sexual abuse) and physical health factors generally may disproportionately affect Black individuals, the investigators write. It also could mean that cognitive testing may overestimate clinical impairment in disadvantaged populations, they write.\n\nBlack and Hispanic individuals are considered twice as likely to be hospitalized by COVID-19 and ethnic and racial minorities are more likely to live in areas with higher rates of infection. Genetics also is a likely factor for their increased risk for increased impact from COVID, much like being at higher risk for hypertension and heart disease early and more severely in life.\n\nA focus of CONGA is to try to better understand how increased risk and effects from COVID-19 impact Blacks, who comprise about 33% of the state\u2019s population.\n\nA reason fatigue appears to be such a major factor among those who had COVID-19 is potentially because of levels of inflammation, the body\u2019s natural response to an infection, remain elevated in some individuals. For example, blood samples taken at the initial visit and again on follow up showed some inflammatory markers were up and stayed up in some individuals.\n\nThese findings and others indicate that even though the antibodies to the virus itself may wain, persistent inflammation is contributing to some of the symptoms like fatigue, she says. She notes patients with conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, both considered autoimmune conditions that consequently also have high levels of inflammation, also include fatigue as a top symptom.\n\n\u201cThey have body fatigue where they feel short of breath, they go to get the dishes done and they are feeling palpitations, they immediately have to sit down and they feel muscle soreness like they just ran a mile or more,\u201d Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThere is probably some degree of neurologic fatigue as well because patients also have brain fog, they say it hurts to think, to read even a single email and that their brain is just wiped out,\u201d she says. Some studies have even shown shrinkage of brain volume as a result of even mild to moderate disease.\n\nThese multisystem, ongoing concerns are why some health care facilities have established long COVID clinics where physicians with expertise in the myriad of problems they are experiencing gather to see each patient.\n\nCONGA participants who reported more symptoms and problems tended to have depression and anxiety.\n\nProblems like these as well as mild cognitive impairment and even impaired vocabulary may also reflect the long-term isolation COVID-19 produced for many individuals, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cYou are not doing what you would normally do, like hanging out with your friends, the things that bring most people joy,\u201d Rutkowski says. \u201cOn top of that, you may be dealing with physical ailments, lost friends and family members and loss of your job.\u201d\n\nFor CONGA, participants self-report symptoms and answer questions about their general state of health like whether they smoked, drank alcohol, exercised, and any known preexisting medical conditions. But they also receive an extensive neurological exam that looks at fundamentals like mental status, reflexes and motor function. They also take established tests to assess cognitive function with results being age adjusted. They also do at-home extensive testing where they are asked to identify odors and the ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, brothy or no taste. They also have blood analysis done to look for indicators of lingering infection like those inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterization of how symptoms evolve over time, the investigators write.\n\nAnd particularly for some individuals, symptoms definitely linger. Even some previously high-functioning individuals, who normally worked 80 hours a week and exercised daily, may find themselves only able to function about an hour a day and be in the bed the remainder, Rutkowski says.\n\nThe investigators are searching for answers to why and how, and while Rutkowski says she cannot yet answer all their questions, she can tell them with certainty that they are not alone or \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nOne of the best things everyone can do moving forward is to remain diligent about avoiding infection, including getting vaccinated or boosted to help protect your brain and body from long COVID symptoms and help protect others from infection, Rutkowski says. There is evidence that the more times you are infected, the higher the risk of ongoing problems.\n\nRutkowski notes that their study findings may be somewhat biased toward high percentages of ongoing symptoms because the study likely is attracting a high percentage of individuals with concerns about ongoing problems.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is thought to have first infected people in late 2019 and is a member of the larger group of coronaviruses, which have been a source of upper respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, in people for years.\n\nAt least part of the reason SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have such a wide-ranging impact is that the virus is known to attach to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, or ACE2, which is pervasive in the body. ACE2 has a key role in functions like regulating blood pressure and inflammation. It\u2019s found on neurons, cells lining the nose, mouth, lungs and blood vessels, as well as the heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. The virus attaches directly to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells, which functions much like a door to let the virus inside.\n\nExperience and study since COVID-19 started both indicate immediate neurological impact can include loss of taste and smell, brain infection, headaches and, less commonly, seizures, stroke and damage or death of nerves. As time has passed, there is increasing evidence that problems like loss of taste and smell, can become chronic, as well as problems like brain fog, extreme fatigue, depression, anxiety and insomnia, the investigators write. Persistent conditions including these and others are now referenced as \u201clong Covid.\u201d\n\nThe research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and philanthropic support from the TR Reddy Family Fund.\n\nRead the full study."

In addition to the general effect on society and health-care systems, patients with systemic sclerosis and their physicians face specific challenges related to the chronic nature of their disease, the involvement of multiple organs, and the use of immunosuppressive treatments. Data from registries and single centre cohorts indicate that the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to increase substantially in people with systemic sclerosis; conversely, severe COVID-19 outcomes are seen more frequently in these patients than in the general population."

        "text": "Background\n\nLittle is known about vaccine effectiveness over time among adolescents, especially against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This study assessed the associations between time since two-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and the occurrence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland.\n\nMethods\n\nWe did test-negative, case-control studies in adolescents aged 12\u201317 years with COVID-19-related symptoms in Brazil and Scotland. We linked records of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antigen tests to national vaccination and clinical records. We excluded tests from individuals who did not have symptoms, were vaccinated before the start of the national vaccination programme, received vaccines other than BNT162b2 or a SARS-CoV-2 booster dose of any kind, or had an interval between their first and second dose of fewer than 21 days. Additionally, we excluded negative SARS-CoV-2 tests recorded within 14 days of a previous negative test, negative tests recorded within 7 days after a positive test, any test done within 90 days after a positive test, and tests with missing sex and location information. Cases (SARS-CoV-2 test-positive adolescents) and controls (test-negative adolescents) were drawn from a sample of individuals in whom tests were collected within 10 days of symptom onset. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 for both countries and against severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) for Brazil across fortnightly periods.\n\nFindings\n\nWe analysed 503 776 tests from 2 948 538 adolescents in Brazil between Sept 2, 2021, and April 19, 2022, and 127 168 tests from 404 673 adolescents in Scotland between Aug 6, 2021, and April 19, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness peaked at 14\u201327 days after the second dose in both countries during both waves, and was significantly lower against symptomatic infection during the omicron-dominant period in Brazil (64\u00b77% [95% CI 63\u00b70\u201366\u00b73]) and in Scotland (82\u00b76% [80\u00b76\u201384\u00b75]), than it was in the delta-dominant period (80\u00b77% [95% CI 77\u00b78\u201383\u00b73] in Brazil and 92\u00b78% [85\u00b77\u201396\u00b74] in Scotland). Vaccine efficacy started to decline from 27 days after the second dose for both countries, reducing to 5\u00b79% (95% CI 2\u00b72\u20139\u00b74) in Brazil and 50\u00b76% (42\u00b77\u201357\u00b74) in Scotland at 98 days or more during the omicron-dominant period. In Brazil, protection against severe disease remained above 80% from 28 days after the second dose and was 82\u00b77% (95% CI 68\u00b78\u201390\u00b74) at 98 days or more after receiving the second dose.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWe found waning vaccine protection of BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland from 27 days after the second dose. However, protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes remained high at 98 days or more after the second dose in the omicron-dominant period. Booster doses for adolescents need to be considered.\n\nFunding\n\nUK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council), Scottish Government, Health Data Research UK BREATHE Hub, Fiocruz, Fazer o Bem Faz Bem programme, Brazilian National Research Council, and Wellcome Trust.\n\nTranslation\n\nFor the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section."

        "text": "Background\n\nIn May, 2022, several European countries reported autochthonous cases of monkeypox, which rapidly spread globally. Early reports suggest atypical presentations. We aimed to investigate clinical and virological characteristics of cases of human monkeypox in Spain.\n\nMethods\n\nThis multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was done in three sexual health clinics in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. We enrolled all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from May 11 to June 29, 2022. Participants were offered lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs for PCR testing. Participant data were collected by means of interviews conducted by dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections and were recorded using a standard case report form. Outcomes assessed in all participants with a confirmed diagnosis were demographics, smallpox vaccination, HIV status, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, signs and symptoms on first presentation, virological results at multiple body sites, co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation. Clinical outcomes were followed up until July 13, 2022.\n\nFindings\n\n181 patients had a confirmed monkeypox diagnosis and were enrolled in the study. 166 (92%) identified as gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and 15 (8%) identified as heterosexual men or heterosexual women. Median age was 37\u00b70 years (IQR 31\u00b70\u201342\u00b70). 32 (18%) patients reported previous smallpox vaccination, 72 (40%) were HIV-positive, eight (11%) had a CD4 cell count less than 500 cells per \u03bcL, and 31 (17%) were diagnosed with a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. Median incubation was 7\u00b70 days (IQR 5\u00b70\u201310\u00b70). All participants presented with skin lesions; 141 (78%) participants had lesions in the anogenital region, and 78 (43%) in the oral and perioral region. 70 (39%) participants had complications requiring treatment: 45 (25%) had a proctitis, 19 (10%) had tonsillitis, 15 (8%) had penile oedema, six (3%) an abscess, and eight (4%) had an exanthem. Three (2%) patients required hospital admission. 178 (99%) of 180 swabs from skin lesions collected tested positive, as did 82 (70%) of 117 throat swabs. Viral load was higher in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal specimens (mean cycle threshold value 23 [SD 4] vs 32 [6], absolute difference 9 [95% CI 8\u201310]; p<0\u00b70001). 108 (65%) of 166 MSM reported anal-receptive sex. MSM who engaged in anal-receptive sex presented with proctitis (41 [38%] of 108 vs four [7%] of 58, absolute difference 31% [95% CI 19\u201344]; p<0\u00b70001) and systemic symptoms before the rash (67 [62%] vs 16 [28%], absolute difference 34% [28\u201362]; p<0\u00b70001) more frequently than MSM who did not engage in anal-receptive sex. 18 (95%) of 19 participants with tonsillitis reported practising oral-receptive sex. The median time from onset of lesions to formation of a dry crust was 10 days (IQR 7\u201313).\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn our cohort, monkeypox caused genital, perianal, and oral lesions and complications including proctitis and tonsillitis. Because of the variability of presentations, clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of monkeypox. Lesion swabs showed the highest viral loads, which, combined with the history of sexual exposure and the distribution of lesions, suggests close contact is probably the dominant transmission route in the current outbreak.\n\nFunding\n\nNone."

        "text": "During the past 15 years allergic reactions to latex have become a significant public health problem, particularly among health-care workers. Approximately 800,000 American adults and children have become allergic to natural rubber latex, found in gloves and pacifiers. When exposed to latex or latex dust, sensitized persons can develop hives, nasal and eye irritation, asthma, and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition in which the breathing passageways swell closed. About 1% of the general public and 4.5% to 17% of health-care workers and others exposed to latex on their jobs have become sensitized. Some have even been forced to terminate their careers for this reason. Medical and dental procedures on sensitized individuals may be complicated by anaphylactic events, as may the use of latex pacifiers by infants. The FDA has received more than 2000 reports of injury and several reports of death associated with latex allergy. In 1996, the agency published regulations that would require all latex-containing gloves and other devices to be labeled accordingly, including warnings about possible allergic reactions.\n\nLatex is a common component of disposable gloves, intravenous tubing, syringes, stethoscopes, catheters, dressings, bandages, and other medical supplies. Among health-care workers, gloves are the most significant source because they are frequently used, and the powder used to line some of them can absorb latex proteins and become airborne. Asthmatic reactions have occurred among people who did not use gloves but merely inhaled latex-containing dust. Thus, sensitive workers can be affected not only by their own gloves but also by those worn by co-workers.\n\nThe surge of latex allergy among health-care workers is primarily attributable to greater use of disposable gloves to prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis B. Increased demand and cost pressures for gloves has led some manufacturers to shorten the manufacturing time by reducing the number of washing and purifying steps, which increases the amount of sensitizing protein that the gloves will transmit.\n\nThe American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has published guidelines and recommends that people who have been diagnosed as allergic wear an identification card (or bracelet) and a self-injectable adrenalin device. Sensitive individuals should be sure that their health-care providers are aware of their condition so that they are not exposed to latex during medical procedures or surgery. A few states have introduced bills to ban the use of powdered latex gloves in medical facilities.\n\nFor Further Information"

        "text": "There certainly must exist an old English proverb warning, \u201cHe who carries coals to Newcastle runs grave risk of being burned.\u201d I must admit that I have felt uncomfortably warm of late in contemplating my presentation before this seminar, in which laetrile should constitute a principal ingredient of my remarks. Some of you have devoted weeks of your lives to concern over this unorthodox cancer treatment and have played major roles in helping the Commissioner prepare his decision on laetrile\u2019s status at the end of the rulemaking procedure called for by the 10th Circuit Court. This decision, published in the Federal Register on August 5, 1977 seems to me the most thorough, broad-gauged, and insightful analysis of a highly touted but ineffective product, the mode of its promotion, and the psychology of its acceptance that I have ever read.\n\nWhat then, in the company of you experts, can I say that will not seem oppressively like res adjudicata or d\u00e9ja vu? So as to gain what I hope may be a fresh perspective, let me try to differentiate between what might be called endemic and epidemic quackery, essaying some historical epidemiology to point to factors present when epidemics occur. Endemic quackery has existed in the world, to quote Voltaire, since the first knave met the first fool. As long as some diseases remain unconquered and death marks the certain terminus of our earthly pilgrimage, and as long as an ethical medical profession abstains from promising the impossible, the unscrupulous will boldly cater to our often desperate hopes. Therefore, a certain basic level of quackery, I take for granted, has existed in all places and at all times and is destined to continue. Occasionally, as one scans the past, he can detect an outburst of quackish energy that I should like to designate as an epidemic. Sometimes a single promotion achieves such a status. At other times the epidemic level consists of a congeries of separate ventures. Before getting to laetrile, let me discuss briefly one epidemic promotion and one epidemic period from the American past.\n\nIn 1796, 180 years before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the federal government took perhaps its initial action regarding a medical device. In that year the government granted the first patent issued under the Consti\u00adtution in the area of health to a Connecticut physician for \u201cImproving Pain, Etc., by Metallic Points.\u201d Elisha Perkins\u2019 famous \u201ctractors\u201d furnished the new nation\u2019s first example of a health quackery epidemic.\n\nAlways in such single-promotion epidemics, it seems to me, an ingenious promoter, or group of promoters, shrewdly devises and/or luckily falls upon an approach that meshes with remarkable pertinence into key elements of the prevailing social climate. In Perkins\u2019 case these elements were fascination with electricity and cultural nationalism.\n\nA small-town country doctor probably trained by apprenticeship to his father, Perkins discovered that he could ease pains in various parts of his patients\u2019 bodies by drawing the blade of his penknife across the skin above the hurting parts and that he could relieve headaches by the ministration of a lacquered iron comb. He also observed that sometimes muscles contracted suddenly when touched during surgery by his knife. Knowing about Franklin and Mesmer, reading an account of Galvani\u2019s experiments, Perkins did what many would-be innovators before and since have done, he compressed what he had heard and observed into a simple theory. Almost all painful conditions, he concluded, especially gout, pleurisy, rheumatism, violent insanity, \u201cinflammatory tumors,\u201d and yellow fever, resulted from a surcharge of an electric fluid that accumulated in the bodily parts. This could be released by drawing a metal point across the afflicted surface, always moving from the center toward the extremities, thus ending pain and working a cure. Asserting in his letters the necessity and propriety of making money from his discovery- Perkins bad a family of ten children to support\u2013, this Yankee from the Nutmeg state shifted his therapeutic instrument from simple knife and comb to specially fabricated devices, a pair of small pointed metal \u201ctractors,\u201d called so because they pulled out pain. Made in a furnace in Perkins\u2019 home, the two tractors were composed of secret alloys, one gold in color, the other silver. In time, forgetting the knife and comb, Perkins insisted that only his patented points would work. Perhaps he became genuinely persuaded such was the case. In the history of quackery many schemers have become converts to the gospel of their own oratory. Perkins sold his tractors for $25 a pair, in his day a princely sum.\n\nElectricity was much in the air in the 18th century, and to posit an electrical cause for most diseases and a sort of miniature lightning rod cure struck the popular mind as both exciting and plausible. At least one testimonial, from a leading figure in the American Philosophical Society, compared Perkins\u2019 achievement favorably with Franklin\u2019s famous experiment and disparaged critics of Perkinism as similar to the English philosophers who had attacked the Philadelphia sage.\n\nThis linkage with Franklin underlined the proud fact that Perkins\u2019 pur\u00adported breakthrough was an American discovery. In the aftermath of a successful Revolution, cultural nationalism blazed brightly in the new nation. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and now the most distinguished physician in the land, argued that there existed in the United States twenty times more intellect and a hundred times more knowledge than there had been in the American colonies before the war. Could it not be, Perkins\u2019 champions queried jubilantly, that a nation which had provided the perfect example of freedom to the world might not also, through the metallic tractors, provide the means to universal health?\n\nPerkins\u2019 shrewd decision to get his tractors patented fit in neatly with this patriotic theme. In truth, patenting was still a very simple practice requiring no proof of an invention\u2019s utility, but a patent could easily appear to be a symbol of governmental backing, even the consummate testimonial to healing potency. Perkins took immediate steps to bolster this sentiment among potential customers. At the very time the state medical society in Connecticut was ousting him for having \u201cgleaned up\u201d his tractors \u201cfrom the miserable remains of animal magnetism,\u201d Perkins labored to find distinguished buyers in Philadelphia, the nation\u2019s capital. And he succeeded. Several members of the Congress acquired a pair. So did the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who wrote a letter praising the tractors to future Chief Justice Marshall. And a pair of the metallic points seems to have been bought by President Washington himself. With the three branches of the government thus leading the way, Americans engaged in a frenzy of \u201cgalvanizing trumpery.\u201d\n\nAs these events demonstrate, Perkins had first-rank promotional talents. Prior to the tractors, he had added to his medical fees income secured from trading mules. His vigorous, magnetic personality certainly had much to do with both his therapeutic and his marketing successes. His series of testi\u00admonial pamphlets shows that Perkins worked as effectively in print as in face-\u00adto-face encounter. He gave tractors to some clergymen, along with a certificate saying they had bought them. And, despite their high cost, the metallic points sold well. An account suggests that people sold horses and carriages in order to buy them, and in one case a Southern plantation.\n\nPerkins countered the opposition of his erstwhile fellows in the Connecticut medical society as the unorthodox almost always do. He accused them of blind\u00adness and greed. And he pointed out that some physicians supported his discovery, despite \u201cmenaces\u201d from the stodgy establishment.\n\nBesides electrical wonder and cultural nationalism, a third factor in the climate of the 1790s may have aided Perkinism to reach epidemic proportions. This was fear of yellow fever. That dread disease appeared again and again during the decade, including devastating attacks on Northern cities. In the Philadelphia epidemic of 1793 Perkins himself had lost a daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren. So a special poignancy marks his inclusion of yellow fever among the ailments amenable to tractor treatment. And the surest proof that Perkins placed great faith in the efficacy of his patented points comes from his going to New York in 1799 when that city lay prostrate in the grip of yellow fever to treat the ill by plying his device. He could not save himself. He contracted the fever end died of it.\n\nPerkins\u2019 death ended the American boom. A British craze, perhaps even more frenetic, engineered by one of Perkins\u2019 sons, vanished when a provincial physician demonstrated that he could get just as enthusiastic patient response by using wooden tractors painted gold and silver as he could secure wielding the authentic patented points.\n\nSome writers, admitting Perkins\u2019 desire for money and his convenient forgetfulness about penknife and comb while later stressing that only the twenty-five dollar tractors possessed therapeutic efficacy, nonetheless wonder if it is appropriate to term him a quack. As his way of death demonstrates, they argue, he believed in his product, and therefore could not be a fraud. Does quackery require fraudulency? Does one \u201cknowingly\u201d have to sin or err in these matters to run afoul of the moral or statutory laws? Yes, said Congress in the 1912 Sherley Amendment. But I prefer\n\nBut I prefer to stand with the 1938 law\u2019s negative, and even apply the principle retrospectively, granting some diffi\u00adculties as one moves backward in time and acknowledging, under this definition, that some \u201cquacks\u201d are more reprehensible than others. To pin down the term , social result as well as personal motive must be taken into account. To the patient-victim it makes no difference whether his self-asserted savior lies brazenly or speaks what he himself ignorantly believes to be the truth.\n\nThe period I wish to point to in which no single promotion dominated but which saw the overall level of quackery reach epidemic proportions covers roughly the middle third of the 19th century. In many ways during these years the social fabric of the nation underwent fundamental change. Quacks and sectarians attuned to the new currents and maneuvering cleverly within their imperatives managed to flourish mightily.\n\nIn its political dimension, the period began with Jacksonian democracy, which discredited an older elite leadership and broadened political power among the populace. In an intellectual sense during these years all branches of the educated establishment suffered widespread popular suspicion and scorn. \u201cThe priest, the doctor, and the lawyer,\u201d wrote an untutored New Englander, all stood convicted of \u201cdeceiving the people.\u201d Orthodox physicians learned nothing about the nature of medicine, he added, except \u201chow much poison . . . could be given without causing death.\u201d This jab at the heroic practice of the regulars had some pertinence~ and quacks were frequently to make it even while they themselves ladled out huge doses of opium and mercury. But it was the lofty status and established power of the educated which came espe\u00adcially under attack. The so-called state \u201cBla.ck Laws\u201d by rich orthodoxy sought to monopolize medical practice irked a growing breed of irregulars. \u201cWe go for free trade in doctoring,\u201d a Cincinnatian wrote in 1849; \u201cmedicine, like theology, should be divorced from the State, and . . . . as in the dif\u00adferent sects of religionists, the various medical systems . . . [should] be treated alike.\u201d Licensing laws were swept away, and Thomsonians, homeopaths, hydropaths, and almost anyone who wanted to could practice. The patent medicine side of quackery profited from other facets of burgeoning democracy, which expanded the newspaper press at the same time that it schooled more people to a level of literacy capable of reading the nostrum advertising which the new journals contained.\n\nIn this atmosphere of freedom, as the common man increasingly made up his own mind about his health, he bought more patent medicines. The right of choice stimulates pride, fires ambition, but also provokes anxiety. Which of the many voices appealing for favor could best be believed? Hard, sharp, unscrupulous bargaining reigned in the realm of both thought and trade. Life became intensely competitive. Tricksters proliferated, and victimization was rampant. Everyone expected roguery, anticipated being cheated, himself sought to cheat in turn. Nor, within limits, did people mind being hoodwinked.\n\nThey had made their own decisions, taken their chances in a free environment. Sometimes they were bound to lose. Indeed, clever imposture tended to amuse them. Such was the state of the popular mind as the sales of nostrums soared. This picture of the period emerges from Neil Harris\u2019 brilliant book on \u201cthe art of P. T. Barnum,\u201d titled Humbug.\n\nCoinciding with these complex aspects of freedom\u2019s ferment, the arrival of the romantic movement also helped quackery along. A romantic climate, Grete de Francesco has written, favors \u201call sorts of nature cures\u201d and \u201cthe development of a new kind of imposture: a falsification of Nature through overemphasis on the natural.\u201d All over America, as vell as in Europe, lay healers in rustic settings employed a variety of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, water being especially prominent. Among those bemoaning the increasing artificiality of life, a preoccupation began with the \u201cnatural\u201d diet. Not that critique of the normal diet was not deserved. But some sages went much further. Sylvester Graham plotted a dietary regimen that he hoped might restore the pristine conditions and the purity of life in the Garden of Eden. Graham\u2019s ideas influenced the doctrines of new religions, the prescriptions of unorthodox physicians, and the promotions of patent medicine vendors.\n\nPlease do not get the idea that I am decrying democracy, freedom, and romanticism because they provided an environment in which clever promoters could manipulate such currents so as to produce an epidemic of quackery. It is Just my hope, of course, to use history to help reveal the dynamism of a perennial threat.\n\nSo far I have spoken of pre-germ theory days when the yardstick of orthodoxy could not by the nature of things measure quackery with the precision of our own times. Therefore, it is a paradoxical phenomenon deserving our earnest scrutiny that probably the single quackery promotion receiving the largest amount of public attention in all our nation\u2019s history should be one of our own day. What mesh of elements from the social climate and maneuvers by its promoters explain the sensational epidemic of laetrile?\n\nBasic, of course, are both the facts and the image of cancer in our society. With the decline of contagious diseases as a cause of death, due to sanitation, vaccines, and chemotherapy, cancer has risen to second place in the mortality lists. The 1900 death rate from malignant neoplasms was 64 per 100,000 deaths, the 1969 rate 160. On the disease and death front then, cancer and its mortality, have moved more to the center of public attention. In light of chemo\u00adtherapeutic miracles, the public wonders uneasily, why can\u2019t there be such a miracle involving cancer? This sense of urgency transmits itself to the Congress which allocates more money which, in turn, increases preoccupation with the disease.\n\nYet the image of cancer may be an even more important force for quackery than its factual circumstances. Heart deaths exceed cancer deaths, but no waves of unorthodox cardiovascular cure-alls have surfaced similar to those in the cancer field, although perhaps obesity remedies may contain an element of this. All diseases possess a popular image. A sports columnist wrote recently that, as a boy, O J. Simpson suffered from rickets, which made him bow-legged and pigeon-toed and forced him to wear his shoes on the wrong feet. In college O.J. told his friends that he had been attacked by polio, because he considered polio a much classier disease than rickets.\n\nThrough most of history the big killers have been pneumonias and gastro\u00adintestinal disorders, taken for granted by the populace because so common and familiar. What brought panic were diseases that caused less loss of life overall, but killed swiftly and painfully when they did come in epidemics, diseases possessing horrible external lesions, like smallpox, cholera, and the yellow fever which Elisha Perkins sought to cure. The fear of leprosy also greatly exceeded its morbidity. Syphilis, in English Restoration drama, was a subject of stock humor: the saddle nose, the falling hair, the aching bones brought gales of laughter from the audience as characteristics of the combatant who had lost in Venus\u2019 wars. In the romantic 19th century, syphilis ceased to be a hilarious disease and became a moral cataclysm. Under the romantic impact, tuberculosis gained the distinction of being the ennobling way to die. Lesions were hidden inside the body. As the consumptive wasted away, his mind was said to become more ethereal and spiritual as he gradually ascended toward his heavenly reward. Nor was this vision a male prerogative: recall the heroines of all these tragic operas.Indeed, for both men and women, a sort of tubercular standard of beauty came to prevail. If one could not achieve the proper paleness, frailness, and slenderness by contracting the disease, diet might lead to the desired result. Published beauty counsel suggested banning butter, cream, milk, cheese, fish, and vegetables. Sometimes small doses of arsenic were prescribed.\n\nThese examples illustrate how the image of a disease can have a powerful influence on conduct. [After drafting this paper I was intrugued to find a more elaborate discussion of the disease theme in the current (January 26) issue of the New York Review of Books. I direct your attention to Susan Sontag\u2019s most perceptive analysis called Illness as Metaphor] That centuries ago cancer began to acquire a hostile and terrifying image may be deduced from the fact that the word \u201ccancer\u201d itself derives from the Greek word for crab. The crawling spread of cancer, gradual but relentless, whether exteroal and observable or internal and secretive, through the centuries appeared to be, and indeed a.mounted to, a sentence of death. This image hangs on, a powerful force in men\u2019s minds, a force not adequately updated by the victories orthodoxy increasingly has won. No doubt orthodoxy\u2019s message, ever more encouraging but never completely reassuring, cannot hope to compete with the frenzied fear, deeply embedded in the folk tradition and constantly revivified by the camp meeting oratory of orthodoxy\u2019s opponents. Here is Harry Hoxsey writing two decades ago on page 1 of his book entitled You Don\u2019t Have to Die: \u201cSuppose you suddenly discovered that you have cancer. A horrible crab-like disease has invaded your body, is gnawing your flesh, has pushed greedy tentacles into your vital organs. A loathsome scavenger slowly and inexorably is consuming you alive, cell by cell.\u201d And, of course, the unorthodox make orthodox weapons against the disease seem as terrifying as the disease itself. It was a laetrile champion who recently spoke scornfully of regular medicine\u2019s \u201ccutting, burning, and poisoning.\u201d\n\nThe assertiveness of the cancer theme among the varieties of quackery available preceded the laetrile epidemic. In recent years, as Wallace Janssen has so vividly pointed out in FDA Consumer, the names of Koch and Hoxsey and the brand name Krebiozen have achieved high public recognition.\n\nBesides cancer\u2019s image as an element of popular culture helping explain the laetrile boom, other facets of the broad climate are involved. The whole trend of 20th century thought, for example, has brought us to new and gloomy versions of romanticism. As our century opened, the prevailing mood was cheerful and so hopeful about the future that progress seemed inevitable. Science had much to do with this, having revealed a comfortable, homey universe working by natural laws. The methods of science seemed transferable to the study of social situations, offering the prospect of resolving society\u2019s strains. Morality was palpable; people discussed all questions in moral terms with nary a blush. Americans as openly esteemed patriotism as morality, antici\u00adpating a great future destiny for the nation. Leaders were generally esteemed. Goodness marked basic human nature, and man\u2019s transgressions resulted not from evil but from error. Education would eliminate error, as technology would banish poverty. One seer welcomed the new century by taking material progress for granted, then adding: \u201cLaws are becoming more just, rulers humane; music is becoming sweeter and books wiser; homes are happier, and the individual heart becoming at once more just and more gentle.\u201d\n\nThings did not continue quite along this line. Relativity and indeter\u00adminacy replaced certainty in science, and the fixity of other 19th century solids also dissolved, including morality. Inevitable progress fell under the impact of a series of terrible wars. The inherent goodness of human nature, battered by new schools of philosophy, crumbled under the revelations from the German concentration camps. The belief in education as a social panacea withered. Science-technology inventiveness did continue to produce wondrous products for mankind\u2019s benefit, but also devised nuclear weapons and polluted the atmosphere. A kind of confident, reasonable, cheerful 19th century syn\u00adthesis gradually came apart, as the 13th century Thomistic synthesis broke up in the 14th century. At this juncture we cannot detect a new Renaissance that might re-establish a common confidence and faith. Rather the omens are disheartening.\n\nA whole host of new religions have sprung up seeking to win the adherence of distraught humankind. As in the 14th century, some of them seem diabolical. Since modern urban industrial civilization strikes many people as part of the problem, some disturbed souls strive to return to nature. Pressing upon this long developing major crisis of belief came Vietnam,. an unpopular, unsuccessful var that put generations at each other\u2019s throats, and Watergate, a seeming indisputable proof of what some voices had long been crying, that blame for discontents could be laid upon leadership.\n\nIn my bones, I feel sure that such a setting as I have quickly sketched provides an atmosphere for the flourishing of quackery. Those questing for new faith are terribly vulnerable to false prophets. The widespread distrust of established authorities encompasses those who traditionally have sought to protect the public from charlatanry. The medical profession su1\u2019fers sus\u00adpicion, including the specialists within it concerned with cancer. In the behavioral survey of health practices and opinions sponsored by the FDA and six other federal agencies and released five years ago, it was concluded that 42% of American adults would not be persuaded by almost unanimous expert opinion that a purported \u201ccancer cure\u201d held out false hope. And, of course, distrust of authority also encompasses regulatory agencies.\n\nThe major explanation for the epidemic proportions achieved by laetrile, it seems to me, lies in the shrewdness with which its proponents have recog\u00adnized these factors I have been discussing in the cultural environment and the skill with which they have exploited them. Misused authority constitutes oppression, and the opposite of oppression is freedom. If, in these parlous times, you can sell a panicked cancer sufferer and his family on the concept, not only that you have a treatment that will do some good, but also, that in accepting the treatment they are taking, in a confused immoral world, a nobly moral stand for an ancient and patriotic virtue, are joining a crusade for freedom itself, If you can do this, I say you are in business. The pitch may even seem persuasive to state legislators and federal judges.\n\nA radical right-wing reaction to our time of troubles, a movement opposing the initiatives of modern government, seems to be. a growing phenomenon. The adherence of such true believers to the ranks of laetrile promoters has unquestionably helped the movement grow. Some leaders of the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy may have profited from the marketing of laetrile as part of their motivation, but there exists unquestionably a massive component of the zeal of the doctrinaire. Frank Salaman, one of the founders of the group, sees \u201cat stake\u201d a \u201cstrong principle of human freedom from uncon\u00adstitutional interference.\u201d And the pro-laetrile film strip \u201cWorld without Cancer\u201d opened with the deceptively disarming words, \u201cWe are not prescribing any course of treatment. We endorse nothing but freedom of choice.\u201d\n\nFreedom of access to worthless cancer treatments, as I wrote in my affi\u00addavit submitted to the rulemaking proceeding, \u201cleads only [backward] toward the license of those ancient days, when \u2018the toadstool millionaires,\u2019 preaching religion and spouting patriotism, operating without restraint, fleeced and often killed their gullible victims. That is a fate from which seven decades of constructive legislation, beginning . . . [in] 1906, has somewhat rescued the nation. Complex, modern, industrial, urbanized society, with standards of medical judgment far more precise than those existing in the 19th century, cannot afford to let the nation\u2019s health be governed by a distorted definition of that great symbol, \u2018freedom,\u2019 which would return piratical anarchy to the realm of health.\u201d Legalizing laetrile, I fear, would breach the dike of the new drug efficacy provisions of the 1962 law in a most ominous way.\n\nAn additional major force lofting laetrile to epidemic proportions, it seems to me, is another kind of alliance formed by its promoters. I don\u2019t know how firm structural links may be, but in developing political action procedures laetrile\u2019s champions have sat at the feet of the health food lobby. And, of course, whatever its earlier purported modes of biochemical functioning, laetrile finally became\u00b7 transmuted into a vitamin. In testifying last July before Senator Kennedy\u2019s Subcommittee on Health, Ernst Krebs, Jr. called laetrile \u201ca scientific revolution as profound as the germ theory of disease . . . [and] the Copernican theory.\u201d What Vitamin C is to scurvy, niacin to pellagra, and Vitamin D to rickets, he suggested, Vitamin B-17 is to cancer. If every American took laetrile regularly, Dr. John Richardson told the same hearing,\u201d in 20 years cancer would be relegated to the dusty pages of history.\u201d\n\nConverting laetrile into a vitamin must have seemed like a master stroke. Not only would it put the product under the food rather than the drug provisions of the national law, it would also broaden the market by giving a more plausible explanation for preventive therapy. Moreover, in light of folk attitudes, it would wrap the product in a glamorous cloak. For the word \u201cvitamin,\u201d for reasons both sound and illegitimate, holds high esteem. The survey of health practices and opinions, already referred to, revealed that three out of four .Americans cherish the magical belief that, no matter how sufficient their diets, taking extra vitamins automatically provides more energy and pep. This myth of superhealth from vitamins stands ready to piggyback other health claims.\n\nThe survey revealed another telling point. Whereas in most aspects of self-treatment, no coherent body of theory underlies consumer action, which is motivated by what the study called \u201crampant empiricism,\u201d in the vitamin and health food area a different set of circumstances prevails. Here alone something like an organized rationale underlies conduct, one based on the premise that the normal food supply, because of inadequacies and introduced poisons, threatens health rather than promoting it, requiring supplements to save the day. This myth has been the deliberate and successful creation of the health food industry, especially since enactment of the 1938 law, fabri\u00adcated out of food folklore running back to the dawn age of man, of clever leger\u00addemain involving complex scientific nutrition, and of some true and scary episodes relating to standard foods. Linking in to the power of this myth could only aid in laetrile\u2019s popular acceptance.\n\nThe health food leaders have excelled at employing the modern mass media to disseminate their nutritional fairy tales. \u201cIn effect,\u201d as Stephen Barrett has put it, \u201cthe media have become the label,\u201d but a label so detached from the packaging as seldom to be actionable. Promoters of dubious nutritional wares have also proved to be amazingly skillful at mobilizing those whom they had converted into a powerful political force. The Vitamin Amendments of 1976 attest to this skill. In their efforts to thwart the FDA\u2019s regulatory goals, even to reduce the agency\u2019s statutory power, the health food industry pioneered in waving the flag of freedom against bureaucratic oppression. Their literature appealed to Washington and Lincoln, asserting \u201cThey Too Fought for Freedom Against Great Odds. \u201cSurely these vitamin freedom shouters furnished an example in doctrine for those proclaiming the riskier freedom of treating cancer with the specious vitamin B-17. Pseudo-nutritionists have also shown laetrile leaders how to turn converts to their therapeutic doctrines into political shock troops.\n\nEvidences exist of cooperative interaction between the National Health Federation, one of the health food industry\u2019s major pressure groups, and laetrile\u2019s supporters. At NHF conventions, pro-laetrile movies have been shown. An NHF governor has edited pamphlets espousing laetrile, and the president of one of the laetrile sponsoring organizations, the Cancer Control Council, has served on the NHF governing board. The NHF Bulletin has boosted laetrile. So it is not surprising that their respective patterns of drum beating, in\u00adcluding political lobbying, should resemble each other.\n\nIn a democracy, of course, representative bodies chosen by the electorate make the rules, including those relating to highly complex scientific matters. I am an admirer of William Lowrance\u2019s book entitled Of Acceptable Risk, Science and the Determination of Safety, the result of an inquiry by the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In essence, he concludes that in making public policy regarding matters of potential danger to society, the assessment of hazard is a scientific decision made by the experts, whereas the determination of risk is a political decision made by elected officials. Public opinion supported the enactment of food and drug laws, and those laws sought to remove from day-in, day-out legislative deter\u00admination highly complex particular questions, giving such decisions to expert agencies with rules of procedure defined in the laws. For legislatures to abandon this established tradition and rule on issues ad hoc seems to me highly unwise social policy, although of course legislatures possess the inherent power to do so. It is an indication of the epidemic levels of nutritional and cancer quackery that, in the federal and state areas respectively, enough pressure has been generated to cut back on the established pattern as well as on the rigor of regulation.\n\nSometimes, in short, when shrewdly propagandized, a major segment of public opinion can be led to support a stand contrary to the conclusions of reputable scientists. And the issue may become emotional enough to make an impact on legislative bodies. \u201cCongress will rely on science when it can,\u201d the counsel for the House Health Subcommittee said recently, but in order for scientists to persuade legislators, they must convince the American people.\n\nThis means a battle for minds, and for wills too, the will to let legis\u00adlators know convictions held. Champions of the unorthodox, for reasons I have sought to explain, bubble over with aggressive zeal. Opponents of the unorthodox on scientific grounds often act with greater diffidence. And when they do act, to many people they only confirm the distrust in which they already are held. Medical societies have not waged such effective battles against quackery recently as earlier in the century; indeed, the American Medical Association disbanded its anti-quackery machinery. Few local groups have demonstrated the vigor and imagination of Stephen Barrett\u2019s Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, among whose anti-quackery ventures the preparation of an excellent book, The Health Robbers, aimed at a broad readership, ranks high in public service. The American Cancer Society has striven to alert the public to the dangers of unproven methods.\n\nWith respect to laetrile, the Food and Drug Administration has assumed the role of primary educator to the nation, in connection with the agency\u2019s legal actions and in a more general sense as well. In testimony before legislative committees, press releases, the pages of FDA Consumer, legal briefs, and a widely distributed poster, the FDA has striven to alert the public to laetrile\u2019s dangers. In the perspective of history, I trust the agency will receive for this service the credit it deserves. In light of what I have said earlier about our intellectual environment, I believe all foes of quackery have reason to remain alert.\n\nA recent student of Elisha Perkins\u2019 career, Jacques Quen, points to the fact that Perkins\u2019 physician critics, in condemning him, did not pose for themselves a further question. Why did the metallic tractors evoke such a satisfied, indeed ecstatic response from those who used them for their pains? Now, 180 years later, a much better understanding prevails of the placebo effect. And the Commissioner\u2019s report contains some intriguing efforts to explain the motivation of laetrile\u2019s users and proselytizers. Yet do we know enough? Is this not a field requiring more research? Would there not be value in seeking to balance Dr. Richardson\u2019s Laetrile Case Histories with another set, revealing not only the physiological circumstances, but as fully as might be, the psychological parameters of laetrile users, not only including the disillusioned, but the most buoyant of champions? Difficult as this task might be, I believe the results might prove to be useful on both the educational and the regulatory fronts against threats from other quackery epidemics in the years ahead.\n\nJames Harvey Young (1915-2006), a professor of history at Emory University, was a social historian whose special interest was the development of food and drug regulation in America. He was a member of the FDA National Advisory Food and Drug Council. His books, The Toadstool Millionaires, The Medical Messiahs, and American Health Quackery, trace the history of quackery in America and efforts to control it. This paper was presented at an FDA Bureau of Drugs seminar in Rockville, Maryland, on January 17, 1978."

        "text": "Krisztian Magori reviews a recent study demonstrating that flaviviruses make mice (and people) produce more of the volatile acetophenone, which is also included in many perfumes, that attracts more blood-seeking female mosquitoes; and that a cheap and safe vitamin A derivative might be able to counter their effects.\n\nhttps://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=399690&picture=woman-perfume-vintage-art-print\n\nDengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes in the Aedes genera are a major public health issue, making hundreds of millions of people sick and killing tens of thousands of people every year. These arboviruses are expected to transmit better and to more people geographically in the future in our warming climate. For millennia, people have recognized that during mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, patients with those diseases need to be protected from further mosquito bites (by e.g. with bednets) during their convalescence in order to limit the spread of these diseases to healthy people. The rationale for this partly is that convalescent patients might be less able to protect themselves from mosquito bites due to their symptoms, and partly because mosquitoes might be more attracted to people sick with mosquito-borne diseases. Such a strategy would be evolutionarily advantageous to mosquito-borne pathogens to maximize their transmission. There is some evidence for increased attractiveness of people infectious with mosquito-borne diseases to blood-seeking female mosquitoes, via manipulating their host. For example, we know that Plasmodium parasites produce an isoprenoid precursor that increases the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells which make malaria-infected mice significantly more attractive to Anopheles mosquito vectors. However, up to now, we didn\u2019t know if arboviruses, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes would similarly manipulate their host to maximize disease transmission.\n\nIn a tour-de-force of a study, Hong Zhang, Yibin Zhu and their colleagues at Tsinghua University demonstrated that flavivirus infected mice were significantly more attractive for blood-seeking Aedes mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were allowed to select to move to cages closer to healthy or infected mice in a three-cage as well as in a two-cage olfactometer. The preference of the mosquitoes was related to volatiles emitted by the hosts, shown by the preference being eliminated by volatile removal.\n\nAnalyzing how the antennae of female mosquitoes reacted to the volatiles of healthy and infected mice, the researchers found that mosquitoes responded significantly to acetophenone, decanal and styrene, but not to other volatiles. Acetophenone attracted more mosquitoes when put on healthy mice, or on a human hand, compared with just the solvent. Using GC-MS, ten-to-hundred times as much acetophenone was found to be released by Zika-virus and dengue-infected compared to healthy mice.\n\nVolatiles taken from the armpits of dengue patients attracted significantly more mosquitoes than just the solvent, or volatiles taken from the armpits of healthy donors. The volatiles taken from the armpits of dengue patients also contained ten-to-hundred times as much acetophenone compared to the volatiles taken from armpits of healthy donors.\n\nWhen the skin bacteria of mice infected with Zika or dengue virus were removed, the preference of mosquitoes for infected mice was eliminated, but not when the gut bacteria was removed, indicating that acetophenone release is connected to skin bacteria on mice. Acetophenone release also reduced to a level similar to that of healthy mice when the skin bacteria of flavivirus-infected mice was removed, but not when their gut bacteria was removed.\n\nDengue and ZIKV-infected mice had ten times as much bacteria, with increased relative abundance of Bacillus and Staphylococcus, but reduced relative abundance of Lactobacillus, compared to healthy mice. Bacillus bacteria produced large amounts of acetophenone when cultured on the skin of germ-free mice, and elicited increased attraction of blood-seeking female mosquitoes in the olfactometer at large enough concentrations.\n\nResistin-like molecula-\u03b1, an antimicrobial protein specifically expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes was expressed at significantly reduced levels in the skin of Zika-virus and dengue-infected mice, compared to healthy controls, based on RNA-seq, qPCR and Western blot. This protein, as well as it\u2019s human analog, RETN, significantly reduced the viability of the acetophenone-producing Bacillus bacteria, compared to other bacteria. Based on previous research, RELM-\u03b1 can be induced by dietary vitamin A derivatives, such as isotretinoin.\n\nRELM-alpha production was restored to healthy levels in Zika-virus and dengue-infected mice that were administered isotretinoin through oral gavage, and relative abundance of Bacillus bacteria on the skin of these mice was also not significantly different from healthy mice. In addition, female blood-seeking mosquitoes were not preferentially attracted to the mice administered isotretinoin, despite their Zika-virus and dengue infection. About half as many mosquitoes were infected among mosquitoes allowed to feed on dengue-virus and Zika-virus infected mice when they were administered isotrenioin, while their Zika virus titers were not significantly different.\n\nIn summary, the authors found that Zika and dengue viruses suppress the production of RELM-alpha, allowing the proliferation of Bacillus bacteria, thereby increasing the production of acetophenone, which acts as a potent attract for blood-seeking mosquitoes. In addition, this process can be obstructed by the administration of isotretinoin, increasing RELM-alpha, reducing Bacillus bacteria, and acetophenone production.\n\nOne of the strengths of this study is that it provides a thorough analysis of this important subject, and it combines a large number of studies employing a variety of techniques from mosquito choice assays to electroantennograms to GS-MS to RNA-seq to microbiological studies in the quest to find the mechanism by which mosquitoes prefer infected mice and people. The study provides strong evidence that flaviviruses modify their host\u2019s microbiome to increase the production of volatiles that attract mosquito vectors, ensuring their transmission to other hosts. This is similar to how Plasmodium parasites increase the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells to attract more Anopheles mosquitoes. There are also similar examples from insect-transmitted plant pathogens, such as where the Cucumber Mosaic Virus makes infected squash plants produce a volatile blend that attracts aphids despite the low quality of the infected plant. These results suggest that we have a whole another reason to protect people infected with flaviviruses from mosquito bites, because even with all else equal, they will attract more mosquitoes.\n\nAnother exciting part of this study was the demonstration that a dietary vitamin A derivative, isotretinoin, was able reverse the attractiveness of infected animals, with only about half of the mosquitoes feeding on the host getting infected. This is particularly exciting because it suggests that in addition to protecting convalescent people from mosquitoes with screens and bednets, we can counter their increased attractiveness to mosquitoes using a low-cost, easily administered, safe drug. Isotretinoin is already used for treating acne under the brand name Accutane, so it could just be repurposed for this new indication, which would be much easier and quicker to license compared to a completely new drug. However, we need to remember that this study was conducted primarily on mice, with the exception of taking volatiles from people\u2019s armpits and testing compounds on their hands. A possible next step might be to conduct a double-blind randomized study with dengue or Zika patients to see if administering isotretinoin orally would also increase RETN production in their skin, reduce Bacillus relative abundance and acetophenone production, and ultimately their attractiveness to female blood-seeking mosquitoes. If the results remain comparable in human studies, we could cut down the number of mosquitoes picking up Zika or dengue viruses from infected people by half, significantly contributing to the control of these flaviviruses.\n\nFinally, the volatile responsible in the current study for increased attractiveness of infected mice, acetophenone, is widely used in fragrances and perfumes, due to its floral, sweet scent to people. Thus, next time you go to areas that are endemic for dengue, Zika, or other flaviviruses, or just have large Aedes populations (such as Eastern North America), which will increase in the future, make sure to check that the fragrance you\u2019re wearing does not include acetophenone!"

        "text": "Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic.\n\nJoel Shurkin, Contributor\n\n(Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe.\n\nThe Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S.\n\nItaly\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone.\n\nIn a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum.\n\nThe pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy.\n\nItalians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified.\n\nAbout three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region.\n\nAs of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died.\n\nIn mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone.\n\nVentilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques.\n\nIn one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing.\n\nFifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment.\n\nThe use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die.\n\nTriage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited.\n\nWhat the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention.\n\n\u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d\n\nOne way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines.\n\nThe allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better.\n\nIn American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan.\n\nResearchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision.\n\nWho is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician.\n\nThese kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world.\n\nYet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel. American doctors will likely face the same agonizing choices that have been necessary in other countries facing the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of educational webinars with residents, medical students, staff, ICU directors,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going on everywhere around the country. I know many hospitals are scrambling to put together policies and committees. I think we're a little ahead of the game at NYU, partly because we\u2019re a hospital of last resort.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any hospital is fully prepared. I think planning was just inadequate.\u201d\n\nSpain is now catching up to Italy with cases. \u201cAnd so,\" Cereda said, \u201care we.\u201d"

        "text": "A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts.\n\nMost people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well.\n\nThere are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past.\n\n\"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed.\n\nSo how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds.\n\nIt's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version.\n\nNussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days.\n\n\"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai.\n\nWhy a vaccine could be better than nature\n\nIf it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection?\n\nA few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems.\n\n\"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nOne example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s.\n\nIn contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections.\n\nCOVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say.\n\nMany of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein.\n\n\"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty.\n\nMany vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects.\n\nEven with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots.\n\nThat may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day.\n\n\"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai."

        "text": "The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past.\n\nA German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system.\n\nNext week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic.\n\nDiscovering antibodies\n\nEmil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin.\n\nVon Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production.\n\n\"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908.\n\nImage Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory. Media credits The Wellcome Collection Media rights CC BY 4.0\n\nVon Behring and Ehrlich's anti-diphtheria serum, known as diphtheria antitoxin, is essentially the same idea as the convalescent plasma being explored as a treatment for Covid-19. The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans.\n\n\"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization.\n\nWhile diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria.\n\nDiphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand.\n\nAfter developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies.\n\nVon Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19.\n\nAntibodies as tools\n\nAntibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body.\n\nBut many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products.\n\nC\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984.\n\n\"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.)\n\nMany new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals.\n\nResearchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways.\n\nKiller T cells\n\nWhile antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells.\n\nViruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target.\n\n\"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\"\n\nImage A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0\n\nBy the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty.\n\nWith colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body.\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells.\n\nDoherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\"\n\nMost vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place.\n\nBut respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems.\n\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms.\n\nThere is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses.\n\nThere are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat.\n\n\"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\""

Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai.

        "text": "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a decrease in the number of cancer screening tests globally?\n\nFindings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 publications, the screening types analyzed were associated with a significant overall decrease (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) from January to October 2020. This decrease showed a U-shaped trend with a negative peak in April 2020 (\u221274.3% for mammography and \u221269.3% for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test) and in March 2020 for Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test (\u221278.8%).\n\nMeaning COVID-19 pandemic measures were associated with widely reduced cancer screening services, which was possibly associated with delayed cancer diagnosis and increased cancer mortality.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Public health services, including cancer screening tests, have been affected by the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nObjective To investigate the pandemic\u2019s association with cancer screening worldwide.\n\nData Sources In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021.\n\nStudy Selection Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included.\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period.\n\nResults The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) for breast cancer screening, \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was \u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified.\n\nConclusions and Relevance A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2020, according to GLOBOCAN estimates, 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million cancer deaths occurred owing to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, which are the first, third, and seventh most prevalent cancers worldwide, respectively.1 Screening programs help to detect cancer at early stages or precursor lesions, leading to decreased mortality.\n\nIn the past few years, especially in low- to medium-income countries,2 cancer screening and prevention protocols have had a remarkable impact on public health. However, major events, such as natural disasters and epidemics, can negatively affect screening rates and access to health care infrastructures and facilities,3 increasing the burden of cancer mortality.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a suspension of many nonurgent medical services was imposed all over the world. Affected services concerned, for example, family planning and abortion4; HIV prevention, testing, and care5; cancer prevention; specialistic treatments such as delays or deferrals in oncologic surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy; and visits for oncologic patients.6\n\nConsequently, cancer screening programs have been temporarily interrupted in most countries. Although these measures may have led to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission,7 their association with public health must still be determined.8\n\nBecause the lockdown restrictions have been heterogeneous in their beginning date and duration, we performed a systematic review of studies that analyzed the variation in the total number of examinations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening performed since the beginning of the epidemic in comparison with the prepandemic period. Our aim was to quantify the global variation of cancer screening procedures during the lockdown period.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Strategy and Selection Criteria\n\nWe conducted our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.9 We developed the study question by following the patients or the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) and study design framework.\n\nThis study is part of a larger project aimed at assessing the global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer, including not only cancer screening but also cancer diagnosis, diagnostic tests for cancer, therapies for oncologic patients, and first visits and follow-up visits for oncology patients. The search string was unique for all these outcomes. We launched the search string on PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus, without language restriction, for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. The search string was made using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and Medical Subject Headings terms and their builder options, if relevant, to improve the search results. Searches were performed with the following terms: neoplasms, diagnosis, drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control, early detection of cancer, COVID-19, and organization and administration.\n\nWe included observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries. We chose articles including a comparison between the periods before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with results indicated as number of screening tests performed, percentage variation between the 2 periods, or rate of screening. Studies were excluded if data on at least 1 of these comparisons were not available. We included only studies in which the 2 compared periods were explicitly stated. If the comparison was made between 2 or more pre\u2013COVID-19 periods, we selected the closest period as a reference (eg, we considered 2019 if data for both 2019 and 2018 were available).\n\nData Collection and Quality Assessment\n\nOur database search and study selection process are outlined in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We found a total of 3630 total articles: 998 articles on PubMed, 1471 on ProQuest, and 1161 on Scopus. We collected initial references in citation files, removed duplicates (1007 articles), and began our screening process of the remaining 2623 articles. We initially excluded articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish, or Italian, and also reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports (245 articles). After this process, studies were first reviewed by title and then by abstract. Finally, we examined the full text of each article against eligibility criteria, and we collected 140 studies for all the outcomes of the research project (screening, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, visits, and therapies). Results on cancer screening were reported in 39 articles. We decided to analyze the types of cancer screening recommended for the general population by the US Preventive Services Task Force.10-12 We excluded screening types performed for high-risk individuals (eg, lung cancer screening13) and those with lower-grade recommendation (eg, prostate cancer screening14). The title and abstract of the articles were independently reviewed by 2 pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) for inclusion in the first screening phase, followed by the full-text screening phase against eligibility criteria. Disagreements among reviewers in the initial abstract screening phase and full-text review were resolved through discussion with a fifth reviewer (P.B.).\n\nTwo pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) perused the prepared checklist to extract from each article the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, country and type of setting (hospitals and private centers were considered clinic based; local and national cancer registries were considered population based), site of cancer, type of screening analyzed (mammography, research of blood in the stool with the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, or human papillomavirus test), and absolute number or rate of screening tests performed in the analyzed period or percentage variation between intervals before and after the beginning of the pandemic. In particular, for colorectal cancer screening, we analyzed data from both types of screening (fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy) separately and together.\n\nWe performed an assessment of the quality and risk of bias of all the studies included, using 9 of the 10 items of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research,15 for a maximum score of 10 points. Studies obtaining less than 7 points were considered inadequate and excluded (no article was excluded because of a low-quality score). eTables 1 through 3 in the Supplement list the articles included in the present analysis and their major characteristics and quality assessment.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nFor each type of screening, we calculated the weighted average of the percentage variation between screening tests performed before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight was calculated with the natural logarithm of the number of daily events in the prepandemic period (ie, daily_screen_precovid obtained by dividing the number of screening tests in the prepandemic period by its duration in days: weight = ln [daily_screen_precovid]). We used the logarithm because of the great variability in the number of tests between studies. We used the absolute value to avoid negative weights.\n\nSome studies did not provide the absolute number of screening tests performed in the prepandemic period, but only the measure of variation between the period being examined and the reference period. For these studies, to calculate the weight, we imputed a value of daily_screen_precovid as the mean value of this variable in the studies having the same type of setting and cancer screening.\n\nWe divided the pandemic period into 5 intervals (all referring to 2020) based on the beginning date of the COVID-19 period being examined in each article as follows: period 1 from January 1 to February 29; period 2 from March 1 to March 31; period 3 from April 1 to April 30; period 4 from May 1 to May 31; and period 5 from June 1 to October 31. This partition of the 5 periods was based on temporal distribution of the available observations along the pandemic period and on the trend of COVID-19 spread and pandemic measures in most countries.16 We did not include studies in which the pandemic period started before January 2020. We did not find studies in which the pandemic period of observation started after October 2020. Studies could contribute to more than 1 period, but not more than once in each period. Then we calculated weighted averages for each interval. Because each period analyzed was determined only by the starting date of the observation, for some studies it could include an interval longer than the predefined periods (eg, an observation that considered January 1 as the starting date and May 31 as the end date was included in the first period).\n\nAn additional analysis was performed for specific geographic areas and for type of setting. We finally fitted ordinary least-squares linear model using Newton-Raphson (maximum likelihood) optimization with percentage change as dependent variables and terms for type of structure, geographic area, and period as independent variables. In the linear regression model, 2-sided P values were used, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.\n\nBecause a percentage reduction could not be lower than \u2212100%, we limited the values of the 95% CIs to \u2212100.0% in case they exceeded it. We considered the funnel plot and performed the Egger regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias.17\n\nNo ethics committee approval and no patient consent were necessary because the study was restricted to publicly available data. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). P values of differences of means are based on the t test, those of differences of proportions are based on z scores, and P tests of multivariate analyses are those derived from the regression generalized linear models for the respective variables.\n\nResults\n\nData on race and ethnicity, as well as demographic information for the study population, were not available. eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the weighted average variation of screening tests performed by cancer type, and Figure 2 shows the corresponding temporal trend.\n\nBreast Cancer\n\nThe average variation of breast cancer screening from January to October 2020 was \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period. The maximum decrease in breast cancer screening occurred in April 2020 (\u221274.3% [95% CI, \u221291.8% to \u221256.7%]), whereas after June there was no significant reduction (\u221213.0% [95% CI, \u221233.0% to 7.1%]). The weighted average of the screening variation was \u221262.0% (95% CI, \u221275.1% to \u221249.0%) for clinic-based settings and \u221241.6% (95% CI, \u221253.2% to \u221230.0%) for population-based ones. The difference between the 2 types of structures was confirmed to be statistically significant in the linear regression analysis (adjusted difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 35.9%; P = .03) (Table 1).\n\nWe divided the geographic areas for breast cancer screening according to the distribution of the countries analyzed in each study: North America (United States and Canada), South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and Europe (Italy, France, and Turkey). In North America, the number of breast cancer screening tests decreased by \u221244.6% (95% CI, \u221257.4% to \u221231.8%) during the COVID-19 period. In this geographic area, the decrease was \u221219.4% (95% CI, \u221255.1% to 16.2%) in January and February, \u221249.9% (95% CI, \u221266.5% to \u221233.2%) in March, \u221286.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221273.5%) in April, \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221262.3% to \u221213.4%) in May, and 0.8% (95% CI, \u221214.1% to 15.7%) from June to October 2020. Europe presented an average variation of \u221267.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u22129.3%), and South America presented an average variation of \u221251.1% (95% CI, \u221267.5% to \u221234.7%). As shown in Table 1, the decrease during April was significant (\u221253.8%; 95% CI, \u221275.4% to \u221232.2%; P < .001), using January and February as the reference; studies from Europe also reported a larger decrease compared with those from North America (\u221235.6%; 95% CI, \u221265.9% to \u22125.3%; P = .02).\n\nColorectal Cancer\n\nThe overall decrease in the number of colorectal cancer screening examinations performed throughout the period from January to October 2020 compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period was equal to \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%). In particular, the decrease for colonoscopy was \u221252.5% (95% CI, \u221266.3% to \u221238.8%), and the decrease for fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test was \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221249.9% to \u221225.8%). The weighted average variation was \u221251.5% (95% CI, \u221269.5% to \u221233.6%) in clinic-based settings and \u221243.7% (95% CI, \u221254.9% to \u221232.6%) in population-based ones.\n\nCompared with the prepandemic period, the global evolution by period showed the greatest decrease in April 2020 (\u221269.3% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221236.9%]) and only a partial recovery during the last months of the analysis (\u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]) from June to October (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nWe analyzed the 3 main geographic areas, including North America (United States and Canada), Asia (India, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and Europe (Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). The weighted average variation during the entire COVID-19 period was \u221245.1% (95% CI, \u221259.3% to \u221231.0%) for North America, \u221234.6% (95% CI, \u221258.1% to \u221211.1%) for Asia, and \u221252.4% (95% CI, \u221269.4% to \u221235.3%) for Europe. For North America, the greatest decrease was in April (\u221283.0% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221255.8%]), whereas in Asia the most remarkable decrease in screening rates was observed in January and February (\u221236.2% [95% CI, \u221277.9% to \u22125.6%]). In linear regression analysis, April had a greater decrease compared with January and February (\u221238.3%; 95% CI, \u221263.6% to \u221212.9%; P = .003), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between geographic areas (Table 2).\n\nCervical Cancer\n\nFor cervical cancer screening, the weighted average variation was equal to \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%). The maximum decrease observed among the 5 periods was in March (\u221278.8% [95% CI, \u221299.3% to \u221258.3%]). In the linear regression model (Table 3), a significant decrease was observed in March compared with January and February (\u221238.9%; 95% CI, \u221275.2% to \u22122.5%; P = .04). Clinic-based studies showed a greater reduction than the population-based ones: \u221251.7% (95% CI, \u221277.3% to \u221226.1%) and \u221251.9% (95% CI, \u221267.8% to \u221235.9%), respectively. In North America (United States and Canada), the weighted average variation was \u221244.7% (95% CI, \u221273.8% to \u221215.7%), whereas in South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico), it was \u221262.4% (95% CI, \u221273.3% to \u221251.5%).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study investigated the association of the COVID-19 pandemic measures with cancer screening by systematic review. Against a global pattern showing an increasing trend for colorectal cancer screening and a slight decrease for cervical cancer screening and mammography from 2000 to 2015,18 our study found a marked association with a decrease in the number of tests performed for the 3 cancer types (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) in all geographic areas considered during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the decision to interrupt all cancer screening programs, the main factors that may have caused this reduction were stay-at-home orders, people's fear of the infection, avoidance of nonurgent medical treatment and care, limited access to in-person medical examinations, and the reorganization of hospital departments.6 The greater decrease for the Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test and colonoscopies may be attributable to more invasive techniques used to diagnose these tumors compared with mammography for breast cancer and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer.\n\nWe identified a similar pattern by period for breast and colorectal cancer screening, with a U-shaped trend having a negative peak in April 2020 and an attenuation in May. This trend was largely attributable to the lockdown measures in numerous countries and territories worldwide. As illustrated through the stringency index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,16 in April 2020 most of the countries had implemented COVID-19 measures. All 3 types of cancer screening showed the least reduction from June to October.\n\nA significant feature of the present study is the analysis of different geographic areas; Europe presented a larger decrease in mammograms compared with North America (Table 1), which could be associated with the fact that in the United States, they are mostly performed through private health insurance,18 whereas in Europe, they are usually provided as part of the public health care system. Conversely, the decrease was similar for colorectal cancer screening between the 2 regions. The restrictions that occurred in Europe could therefore have had a greater association with the cancer screening procedures that imply an actual attendance to the health care structure providing the service. Our results indicated that invasive colorectal cancer screenings (colonoscopies) had a larger decrease than noninvasive ones, such as fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test (\u221252.5% vs 37.8%, respectively), which were more easily performed as a colonoscopy alternative.19 Unlike the global decrease in colorectal cancer screening, Asia presented the most remarkable decrease in January and February; however, the variability of COVID-19 epidemiology and restrictive measures between Asian countries20,21 complicates the interpretation of this matter.\n\nThe percentage variation for cervical and breast cancer screening was greater in South America compared with North America (\u221262.4% vs \u221244.7% and \u221251.1% vs \u221244.6%, respectively); however, we cannot assume that it will result in worse consequences for Latin America owing to its weaker health care system before the pandemic.22\n\nAn important aspect of our review was the consistency of results across a wide spectrum of health care settings. The association between the epidemic and cancer screening was greater in studies based in hospitals or other clinic settings than in population-based studies, especially for breast cancer screening (\u221262.0% vs \u221241.6%; P = .03), which could be explained by clinic-based studies\u2019 considering only the decrease in the number of patients who actually attended the screening test vs population-based studies\u2019 including also patients who did not participate in screening programs in the prepandemic period. There was no evidence of publication bias either qualitatively according to funnel plot asymmetry or quantitatively with the Egger regression test.\n\nThe aim of identifying early neoplastic lesions in the case of breast cancer and precursor lesions in the case of colorectal and cervical cancer was to decrease the incidence of invasive cancer.23 The most concerning potential effect of a decrease in cancer screening is an increase in cancer mortality, as estimated in the United States.24 The interruption of cancer screening could delay diagnosis of tumors, causing a shift to more advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, this could be associated with increased avoidable cancer deaths, aggravate the patients\u2019 discomfort and disease burden, and be associated with increased workload for medical personnel and increased costs for the health care system.8,25,26 In addition, a portion of the postponed screening tests could be impossible to recover because during the suspension some patients exceeded the maximum age to be included in screening programs.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur review has some limitations. First, considerable heterogeneity between countries was present in terms of screening protocols,27 services\u2019 accessibility and participation of the target population, lockdown measures, and incidence of COVID-19 and its temporal trend; all of these factors could not be considered in our statistical analysis. Second, the attribution of an observation to 1 of the 5 periods was based only on its beginning date, which might lead to nondifferential misclassification. Future studies on variations in screening numbers will need to be performed to clarify long-term implications and adopt adequate public health strategies. Third, in some studies we had to impute the number of daily events to calculate the weight.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, with a U-shaped temporal pattern. Although for breast and cervical cancer screening, the data suggest a recovery after May 2020, the decrease in colorectal cancer screening persisted until October 2020. This is expected to be associated with an increase of avoidable advanced cancers and cancer-related deaths. Further investigation regarding cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is required.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 18, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.2617\n\nCorresponding Author: Paolo Boffetta, MD, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy (paolo.boffetta@unibo.it).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Teglia and Angelini had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nConcept and design: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nDrafting of the manuscript: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nStatistical analysis: Teglia, Angelini.\n\nSupervision: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported."

And now, with the BA.5 subvariant comprising a majority of cases in the United States, and reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations rising, there\u2019s a growing need for more people to not only get vaccinated but boosted too. Yet confusion remains around the second COVID-19 booster dose.\n\nAdvancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA\n\nHere are some questions patients might have about second COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, along with the answers that physicians should be ready to share.\n\nWhy are booster doses needed? Why are booster doses needed?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are working well to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death, but the latest data show that booster doses significantly increase protection against the Omicron variant. That is why a booster dose\u2014or in some cases two\u2014are recommended.\n\nIn the face of the Omicron variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that, compared with people who have received their primary series and two booster doses, unvaccinated adults 50\u201364 years old were 45 times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19. Unvaccinated seniors were 51 times likelier to land in the hospital.\n\nResearch published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report also shows that during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third vaccine dose of a mRNA vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters as well as preventing hospitalization.\n\nMeanwhile, a JAMA study shows that receipt of three doses of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine\u2014compared with being unvaccinated or having received two doses\u2014was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants.\n\nWho is eligible for a second booster dose? Who is eligible for a second booster dose?\n\nA second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are recommended for people over 50. A second booster is also recommended for certain people 12 years or older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n\nAdditionally, people 18 through 49 years old who got a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for both their primary dose and booster can choose to get a second booster of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nDiscover what doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 vaccine boosters.\n\nHow soon can you get a second booster dose? How soon can you get a second booster dose?\n\nFor people over 50 and with compromised immune systems, a second booster dose should be administered four months after receiving an initial booster dose. And adults who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their primary series and booster dose at least four months ago, should get a second booster dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nRelated Coverage What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 vaccine boosters\n\nCan I mix and match vaccines for my booster dose? Can I mix and match vaccines for my booster dose?\n\nThrough the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authorization and the CDC\u2019s recommendation, heterologous boosting\u2014aka \u201cmixing and matching\u201d\u2014is allowed with a single dose of any of the authorized COVID-19 vaccine boosters for people 18 years or older. For example, those who got Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose series can receive a booster shot from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nPhysicians will look at the clinical considerations, including rare adverse events, and perform an individual benefit-risk assessment to inform patients about which booster vaccine to use. Mixing and matching may only be considered for the booster dose.\n\nWhich vaccine booster should I get? Which vaccine booster should I get?\n\nThe CDC recommends individuals get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis came after the Food and Drug Administration revised the fact sheets for J&J COVID-19 vaccine physicians and other health professionals (PDF) and patients (PDF), which now include a contraindication for people with a history of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following the J&J vaccine. Women 30\u201349 years old are at highest risk, with one in 100,000 developing TTS after J&J vaccination.\n\nWhat is the difference between an additional dose and a booster dose? What is the difference between an additional dose and a booster dose?\n\nAn additional dose is often administered to people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems to improve their response to their initial vaccine series. A COVID-19 booster dose is given when a person has completed their primary vaccine series and protection against SARS-CoV-2 has decreased over time.\n\nThat is why patients with compromised immune systems are receiving a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine rather than a booster. This can be either Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to a third dose, these individuals may receive two booster shots.\n\nIs it better to get the second booster in the summer or fall? Is it better to get the second booster in the summer or fall?\n\nThe FDA has asked Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to develop bivalent vaccines that are designed to target the original coronavirus strain, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. This is because it is critical that there are safe and effective vaccine boosters that can provide protection against circulating and emerging variants. The FDA hopes the updated vaccines will be available in October. However, if you are eligible for a booster now, you should get a second booster dose and not wait for the bivalent vaccines to be made available.\n\nThis means people older than 50 and anyone over 12 years old who are immunocompromised should get a second booster sooner rather than later. Those who were recently infected with an Omicron subvariant, may choose to wait 90 days before getting a second booster.\n\nIt is hard to say what SARS-CoV-2 will do in the fall, which means getting a COVID-19 vaccine booster as soon as someone is eligible is key.\n\nHow can I talk to my parents and grandparents about getting a COVID-19 booster? How can I talk to my parents and grandparents about getting a COVID-19 booster?\n\nFor some, it can be hard to talk with relatives who may have concerns or questions about getting vaccinated, especially parents and grandparents. However, older adults are at a greater risk of being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 if they catch the disease.\n\nEveryone\u2019s motivations for skipping the vaccine or booster doses are different. That is why it can be helpful to sit down and talk with loved ones. This is where it is important to acknowledge their concerns, share facts and recommend they speak with their physician to learn more.\n\nDiscover how to have crucial conversations with vaccine-hesitant patients.\n\nRelated Coverage What sets apart Novavax option from other COVID-19 vaccines\n\nIf I haven\u2019t had a first booster dose, is it too late? If I haven\u2019t had a first booster dose, is it too late?\n\nNo, it is never too late to get a booster, says the CDC. For those who have not yet received their first booster dose, they should go out and get it. This is because the evidence is strong, showing that a booster dose helps to prevent more severe outcomes with the Omicron variant and its subvariants.\n\nI\u2019m fully vaccinated, so why do I need a booster? I\u2019m fully vaccinated, so why do I need a booster?\n\nImmunity from vaccination does wane over time, increasing your risk of infection or severe illness. But a booster dose dramatically increases a person\u2019s immune response and raised their level of protection against Omicron subvariants. The booster doses help to restore some protection that is lost as time passes.\n\nIn an episode of the \u201cAMA COVID-19 Update,\u201d Andrea Garcia, MPH, discusses second boosters.\n\nIf I still catch SARS-CoV-2, what\u2019s the point of a booster? If I still catch SARS-CoV-2, what\u2019s the point of a booster?\n\nSeveral Omicron subvariants are circulating around the United States. These subvariants are very transmissible and can overcome immunity. But people who are boosted have shorter periods of being infectious, which can protect other people around them. The booster dose also helps protect against severe outcomes of COVID-19 such as hospitalization or death.\n\nWhat side effects can I expect from a COVID-19 vaccine booster? What side effects can I expect from a COVID-19 vaccine booster?\n\nAfter the second booster shot, side effects may be more intense than previous doses, according to the CDC. Side effects that have been reported after getting a booster shot are similar to those after the two-dose or single-dose primary shots. The most reported side effects include fever, headache, fatigue and pain at the injection site.\n\nOverall, most side effects were mild to moderate. But these side effects are normal and are signs that the body is building protection and should go away within a few days, according to the CDC.\n\nThe AMA has developed frequently-asked-questions documents on COVID-19 vaccination covering safety, allocation and distribution, administration and more. There are two FAQs, one designed to answer patients\u2019 questions (PDF), and another to address physicians\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine questions (PDF).\n\nFind out more with the AMA about COVID-19 and vaccine development."

        "text": "In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death in the US, accounting for 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, accounting for 350 000 deaths.1-3 The pandemic may also have indirectly led to increases in other causes of death, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and unintentional injuries.2,4 We examined the leading causes of death in the US, overall and in various age groups, from March 2020 to October 2021.\n\nMethods\n\nWe obtained final national death certificate data for 2020 and provisional data for 2021 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (accessed May 5, 20225). We excluded data more recent than October 2021 because they were incomplete. We determined the 5 leading causes of death by year and age group, and compared the period March to December 2020 with the period January to October 2021. Because the data are publicly available, the study did not require institutional review board review.\n\nResults\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%) were the most common causes of death in the US. There were 2.875 million deaths in March to December 2020 and 2.855 million deaths in January to October 2021; the 5 leading causes of death were the same in each year. Among those older than 1 year, the number of deaths increased across age groups.\n\nDeaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 accounted for the largest number of deaths in every group aged 55 years and older (Table, Figure). The leading 3 causes of death in these age groups were the same in 2020 and 2021. Among people aged 85 years and older, COVID-19 was ranked as the second leading cause of death in 2020 (110 000 deaths, 12.8% of deaths), and third in 2021 (69 000, 8.9% of deaths). Among those aged 45 to 54 years, COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2020 (17 000 deaths, 10.4% of deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and accidents; in 2021, however, it was the leading cause of death (30 000 deaths, 16.8% of deaths).\n\nIn both time periods, accidents accounted for the largest number of deaths in every age group 1 to 44 years. Compared with 2020, COVID-19 increased from the fifth (6100 deaths) to the second leading cause of death (13 000 deaths) among those aged 35 to 44 years in 2021, became the fourth leading cause of death in 2021 among those aged 25 to 34 years (5000 deaths), and those aged 15 to 24 years (1100 deaths).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 deaths in the US and was a top 5 cause of death in every age group aged 15 years and older. Cancer and heart disease deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths overall and in most age groups, whereas accidents were the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years. Compared with the 2020 time period, deaths from COVID-19 in the 2021 time period decreased in ranking among those aged 85 years or older but increased in ranking among those aged 15 to 54 years, and became the leading cause of death among those aged 45 to 54 years.\n\nThe increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020,6 perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups.\n\nThe pandemic also has had indirect effects on other causes of death in the US. From 2019 to 2020, death rates increased for heart disease, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes.2 Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes.4 Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups; the pandemic may have contributed to some of these deaths.\n\nOur analysis was limited by potential misclassification of the cause of death and incomplete death data for 2021, although we included a lag of 6 months to increase the completeness of the provisional data. Moreover, because our analysis only extended through October 2021, it does not include deaths that occurred during the Omicron wave of the pandemic of late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 9, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 5, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2476\n\nCorresponding Author: Meredith S.

        "text": "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is participation in a remote monitoring program for COVID-19, supported by nurses around the clock, associated with subsequent hospitalization?\n\nFindings In this cohort study of 9378 patients, participation in a remote monitoring program was associated with lower odds of hospitalization 2 to 14 days after a positive COVID-19 test, after an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting.\n\nMeaning These findings suggest that remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 may help patients better manage symptoms at home and help hospitals better manage bed capacity.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Health care systems have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs to manage patients with COVID-19 at home, but the associations between participation and outcomes or resource utilization are unclear.\n\nObjective To assess whether an RPM program for COVID-19 is associated with lower or higher likelihood of hospitalization and whether patients who are admitted present earlier or later for hospital care.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational, cohort study of RPM was performed at Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, an academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Participants included patients with internal primary care physicians and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ambulatory setting between March 30, 2020, and December 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022.\n\nExposures Activation of RPM program.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations within 2 to 14 days of a positive test. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for differences between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed looking at usage of the RPM among patients who activated the program.\n\nResults A total of 10 660 COVID-19\u2013positive ambulatory patients were eligible, and 9378 (88.0%) had email or mobile numbers on file and were invited into the RPM program; the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (16.3) years and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Patients who activated monitoring (5364 patients [57.2%]) had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) free-text comments. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert; 128 of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001). In weighted regression analysis, activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and time period. Monitored patients had a longer mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days), a shorter length of stay (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days), and less intensive care use (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]).\n\nConclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that activation of an RPM program is associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care use, and length of stay among patients with COVID-19.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required substantial and expeditious changes to health care systems to address challenges posed toward allocating hospital resources, preventing community transmission, and treating patients.1-4 Particularly during the pandemic onset and the waves of more contagious variants, substantial strain has been placed on hospital systems to address shortages of staff, beds, and supplies,5 forcing them to implement rationing programs and measures to match patients with the most appropriate level of care.6 To mitigate community transmission and optimize resource utilization, health care systems have rapidly expanded telemedicine programs across all specialties.7,8 In addition, strategies to care for people at home using remote patient monitoring (RPM) were created to triage and manage patients with COVID-19, who may worsen during the duration of their illness.9 For example, patients who present with mild symptoms at initial diagnosis can deteriorate greatly during the course of their illness, requiring hospital admission and critical care.10 Although RPM has generally been trialed in the management of chronic disease, it may also be an effective tool to manage health care resources for more acute episodes of care.8,11-14\n\nPrevious studies8,15,16 evaluated home monitoring in patients with COVID-19 with mild symptoms during self-isolation, with early studies17 showing positive results with fewer admissions. Pulse oximetry at home has been successful in identifying patients needing emergent medical attention.14,18-20 It is unclear, however, whether participating in an RPM program is associated with patient outcomes or appropriate in-person resource utilization.\n\nOur objective in this study is to evaluate the implementation of a large-scale daily RPM program for patients with COVID-19 who were managing symptoms from home. We particularly sought to assess the association of RPM with health care utilization (ie, whether RPM would be associated with increased or decreased admissions compared with those not undergoing monitoring). Secondarily, we sought to see whether patients who were eventually admitted would present earlier or later for hospital care. In these analyses, we sought to also know whether RPM was associated with inappropriate admissions (length of stay \u22641 day) or inappropriate home care (a delayed presentation leading to higher mortality, intensive care utilization, or length of stay).\n\nMethods\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\n\nThis cohort study was conducted within an academic-community health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network provides 1.5 million ambulatory visits and cares for 55 000 hospitalized patients annually. The Health Network operates 45 clinic locations in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.\n\nAll patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at an affiliated laboratory site who tested positive were eligible for the program. Any patient could request testing either through our mobile application, patient portal, telephone, or in-person urgent care or scheduled ambulatory visits. Patients were automatically invited to enroll in the RPM program if their email address or mobile telephone number was on file at the time of testing. Patients were also invited if they had an affiliated primary care physician (PCP) within the system and had an outside positive test that was abstracted into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver and agreed to the program\u2019s terms of use at enrollment. In addition to the email invitation, patients received a COVID Care Kit, a collection of educational materials, handouts, and a pulse oximeter that was available to pick up from testing sites; after October 2020, kits were automatically shipped to patients.\n\nThe program group was defined as any patient who activated the RPM program. Activation was defined as claiming an account within the RPM platform. As a sensitivity analysis, we secondarily assessed participation if the patient, in addition to activating their account, had at least 1 or more check-ins, which are programmed questions to which patients respond.\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.21\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nAll patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of March 31, 2020, through December 15, 2020, at an affiliated laboratory site. Follow-up data collection for hospitalization within 14 days continued through December 31, 2020. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with asymptomatic tests (because these were often scheduled before procedures or other planned admissions), abstracted results, and patients who were admitted within 24 hours of a positive test. We further limited the patient sample to those who had internal PCPs to reduce the chance of missing hospitalizations.\n\nCOVID-19 RPM Program\n\nThe COVID-19 RPM program was an automated engagement solution, supported by registered nurses, designed to improve the patient experience, coordinate care, and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On March 30, 2020, the system began the program using GetWellLoop (GetWellNetwork) monitored by a centralized team of Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin nurses. Patients either used a responsive web application or downloaded a mobile application. Patients were asked to track their symptoms, temperatures, and pulse oximetry readings, if available. The program provided 14 days of check-ins related to progress and symptoms, in the form of questions and structured responses, while also providing a space for free-text comments (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The program also provided educational guidance related to COVID-19, including caring for themselves at home, minimizing spread, and stress management.\n\nA centralized virtual care team (VCT) monitored patient check-ins and free-text comments around the clock. Abnormal survey responses (eg, breathing issues or worsening fever) alerted VCT members on their dashboard. Upon reviewing the alert, the VCT contacted patients to initiate an escalation of care or to conduct further medical evaluation if warranted. VCT nurses also reacted to patient comments independently from alerts to provide education or coaching, such as how to incorporate lying in the prone position (ie, proning) into their daily care. Patients were discharged from monitoring after 18 days.\n\nData Collection\n\nData for evaluating program outcomes were collected using reporting databases from the EHR (Epic Systems). We collected patient profile data, including sex, age, race, address, marital status, insurance, and PCP status (internal or external). Race was assessed in this study because of known racial and ethnic disparities in accessing digital health care services.22-24 We used patient addresses geocoded to the Census block level to determine the local area deprivation index, derived from the US Census and American Community Survey,25 as a measure of socioeconomic status and grouped by quartile.26-28\n\nData about the clinical scenario (including presence of symptoms and their onset) were derived from the individual testing orders. We obtained other clinical data, including body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and comorbidities as calculated through the Charlson Comorbidity Index29,30 from the EHR as of the testing date. Participation in the RPM program was provided through platform usage data. These data included system registration, activation, check-ins, alerts, and comments.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\nOur primary outcome was hospitalization within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Hospitalizations were included if they had a flag as being related to COVID-19 through laboratory testing or hospital billing diagnosis. Hospitalizations outside the health system were not available, and readmissions were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the likelihood of missing outside hospitalizations, we limited the analysis to patients with an internal PCP because patients with external PCPs may be more likely to seek hospital care elsewhere.\n\nTo know whether RPM inadvertently may have been associated with increased mortality, such as by delaying hospitalization, we secondarily tracked patient deaths of the study cohort. Thirty-day mortality and 90-day mortality were defined as a patient marked as deceased within the EHR and/or having a death date noted within 30 or 90 days, respectively, of a positive test date. Mortality data were extracted from the EHR system in November 2021 in case death reporting in the EHR lagged.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. To examine factors associated with activation, patients were divided into those who were enrolled and activated and those who were enrolled and did not activate. Age was categorized for analysis. We calculated the frequency for variables related to patient demographics and information related to personal health and COVID-19 status, along with means and SDs for time intervals, such as length of stay and time from test to hospitalization. A t test was used to test the mean difference of the 2 groups (RPM activated or not) in terms of the characteristics measured in continuous variables, whereas a \u03c72 test was adopted for categorical variables. For time intervals (time to hospitalization and length of stay), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Two-sided tests were used with a priori levels of significance of \u03b1 = .05. All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31\n\nTo assess the association between activation and hospitalization, we performed propensity-weighted logistic regression using the glm package.32 With all patients being invited to use the RPM program, we used inverse propensity score weighting to account for potential bias in the observed covariates through self-selection or other mechanisms following methods by Olmos et al.33 Covariates included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, time period, insurance, marital status, Area Deprivation Index from the Census block level, encounter type where testing was ordered, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, prior hospitalization, and digital engagement proxied as having reviewed their COVID-19 test results electronically through the patient portal or the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin mobile application. We also included a variable for time period (1 of the 3 waves in 2020) to allow for varying mean differences in outcomes over time due to patient behavior, including care avoidance34 at the beginning of the pandemic, and guideline changes during the 3 COVID-19 waves that could have affected enrollment status or clinical outcomes. The average treatment effect was calculated as the mean difference in weighted outcomes between the activated group and the invited but nonactivated group. Inverse probability weights were based on the propensity score of each patient,35 defined as the probability of a patient activating RPM conditional on observed covariates as described already, for doubly robust estimation.36\n\nWith less than 4% of the data missing observations for either socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or obesity, the primary analysis was run on complete cases. We used multiple imputation using the mice37,38 package to confirm the results. We ran additional models that included only activated RPM patients and factoring whether they engaged in the program (had check-ins digitally) or not. We also performed propensity score matching with full matching39 using the MatchIT40 package. Finally, we performed a propensity-weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis on complete-case data using the Survival41 and Survminer42 packages. In the weighted Cox model, the starting point was the date of the test and patients were only censored at day 14.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the study period, 135 786 patients underwent testing for COVID-19, and 25 040 patients (18.4%) had at least 1 positive test. Of these patients, 10 660 were retained for analysis after excluding those who were younger than 18 years, who did not have an internal PCP, or who were hospitalized at the time of testing (Figure 1). A total of 9378 patients (88.0%) were offered enrollment into the RPM program through an email invitation, comprising the final analytical cohort. The mean (SD) age of invited patients was 46.9 (16.3) years, and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women.\n\nEngagement With the RPM Program\n\nOf the 9378 invited patients, 5364 (57.2%) activated monitoring (Table 1). Patients who activated were predominantly female (3467 of 5364 patients [64.6%] vs 1981 of 4014 patients [49.4%]). Differences in activation by race and ethnicity were not significant, although differences by comorbidities were observed. Patients with Medicare were also less likely to activate than those without Medicare (795 of 5364 patients [14.8%] vs 769 of 4014 patients [19.2%]; \u03c72 3 = 38.65; P < .001). When patients requested testing through our digital platform for testing, 1805 of 2927 patients (61.7%) activated, whereas 354 of 723 patients (49.0%) with in-person visits activated (\u03c72 5 = 61.25; P < .001).\n\nPatients who activated had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) comments with their clinical care teams. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert.\n\nUtilization and Clinical Outcomes\n\nOne hundred twenty-eight of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized within 2 to 14 days of their test (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001) (Table 2). The odds of admission were higher for patients with advanced age, male gender, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with obesity or more medical comorbidities. The mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization was slightly longer among activated patients (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days). Among those patients admitted, the mean (SD) length of stay was 2.7 days lower for RPM-activated patients than for nonactivated patients (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days; t = \u22123.4185; df = 244.03; P = .001). Monitored patients had less intensive care use than those who were not monitored (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Patients with RPM were not significantly more likely to have short (length of stay \u22641 day) hospital stays (47 of 222 patients [21.2%] vs 50 of 210 patients [23.8%]). The unadjusted 90-day mortality for all patients was 0.2% (10 patients) among activated patients and 0.6% (26 patients) among nonactivated patients.\n\nLogistic Regression With Inverse Propensity Score Weighting\n\nIn multivariable regression analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (for the likelihood of activating RPM, the C statistic was 0.67; for balance and propensity distribution, see eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement), activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) (Table 3). Results using multiple imputation for missing data were similar (eTable 1 in the Supplement). As a robustness check, the Cox proportional-hazard regression with inverse propensity score weighting provided similar results (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), as did regression with propensity score matching (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). As a sensitivity analysis of only activated patients, patients with check-ins had a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73; P = .001) after weighting on propensity to have at least 1 check-in (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 9378 patients who were offered RPM for COVID-19, activation of the RPM program was associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and length of stay. Following an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting, patients who activated still had lower odds of being hospitalized, adjusted for observed clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nAlthough a strict control group was not available, because of the rapid implementation and goal of assisting patients and clinical operations, several methods including the inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching were used to balance the comparison cohorts on the basis of the observed covariates. The positive outcomes seen in reducing hospitalization are similar to those described in earlier studies.11,17,43-45 We found baseline differences between patients who did and did not active RPM, similar to prior studies, although our application of the inverse propensity score weighting provides a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of these observed differences on our result and a more advanced analytical evaluation of the association of RPM with the main study outcomes. Our study is also different because it was delivered to a more general population as well.\n\nThe mechanism underlying RPM\u2019s association with hospitalization is not clear, but several factors may explain it. First, patients who were monitored also received education that may have affected their care trajectory, such as proning to help improve oxygenation. Second, physicians caring for patients who received the pulse oximetry and nurse support through the RPM might have felt comfortable not sending patients into the emergency department and hospital. An alternate explanation is that patients who activated were less ill, and residual confounding that could not be removed accounted for these differences. In both inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching, with reasonable C statistics and matching parameters, the associations persisted.\n\nIn addition to findings related to hospital admission, the data showed that patients who were admitted to the hospital while being monitored were hospitalized later than those without monitoring. Although the reasons behind such delays are not immediately known, there are different hypotheses that may explain this finding. One could be that the RPM program allowed patients to be managed and monitored at a level that would have required an admission for those who were not enrolled in the RPM\u2014that is, either the patient or a clinician chose to defer hospital-based care because of the availability of RPM. Another factor could be that the nurses\u2019 support through the RPM program delivered remote care that decreased risk and led to only essential admissions. This finding does not support a preintervention hypothesis that RPM would signal patients to be admitted earlier. The findings suggest that, although patients under RPM were admitted, on average, later than non-RPM patients, the late presentation was not inappropriate given that hospital length of stay, critical care utilization, and mortality were not increased in this group.\n\nOur study also found that age and race were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization. These results mirror the current body of evidence suggesting who is most at risk both for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe symptoms.46-48 To that end, although RPM and other digital interventions can be effective in deploying and allocating scarce health care resources, we must continue investigating whether such strategies exacerbate existing disparities in care utilization and outcomes. These disparities have been observed in many other digital health interventions, including video visits and telemedicine.49-51\n\nThe lessons learned from our study and others are numerous, although many questions remain regarding best practice RPM implementation for COVID-19 and other diseases and conditions. First, it remains unknown at which point in the course of disease RPM is most impactful on outcomes. Although the digital component of the RPM is easily scalable, concerns regarding other components should be carefully evaluated. In our study, we implemented a remote nurse support model. The virtual nurses had full access to the EHR and could communicate with clinical care teams. Expanding similar programs across multiple areas and diseases would require sophisticated operations and resource allocations. Further research and evaluation of these new remote operating models are warranted and should be carefully evaluated for safety.\n\nExpansion of these programs should consider access and equity. In a previous study,50 we have demonstrated that access to digital technology is disproportionate among racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our program was accessible to anyone with a smartphone, although some technological literacy is required. Simple text messaging may also help reach additional people.\n\nLimitations\n\nSome limitations of this study should be addressed. With the observational nature of the study, selection bias of healthier patients into the RPM activation exists, and although we used propensity score adjustment, residual confounding may still persist. The data were retrospective and sourced from databases, which may make the results less reliable. For example, we could not verify whether hospitalization, escalation of care, or mortality were a result of COVID-19 or another cause. To mitigate this effect, we attempted to limit follow-up data to include 15 days given the reported duration of symptoms, and we reexamined mortality data from the EHR after at least 9 months following the study period. Location and hospital system factors may have influenced enrollment rates and clinical outcomes, which could make our results less generalizable to all populations.\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 treatment guidelines (decision to place patients in the prone position or intubation recommendations), diagnosis (evolving symptom profile), and community transmission were highly dynamic during the early course of the pandemic.52,53 Clinical outcomes may have improved throughout the course of the pandemic. The RPM program was also rapidly updated throughout the pandemic, although the core content of monitoring, proning as tolerated, and infection control for ambulatory patients remained the same. These data were from the prevaccine era; after vaccines became available54 and distributed,55 the absolute benefit of RPM may have decreased for low-risk individuals.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis report builds upon experiences from other groups showing that RPM for COVID-19 was feasible and well-received, while adding data about outcomes. Moving beyond COVID-19, these data highlight where RPM can be a helpful adjunct to care. Resource optimization is a central tenet of both RPM and pandemic-era practices. If reducing avoidable admissions can be achieved through virtual interventions, then practitioners can focus on in-person care for the most ill patients while also limiting unnecessary contact at hospitals and clinics, which is key to decreasing the spread of COVID-19. These results may also be used to establish better care guidelines for those monitoring moderate symptoms from home. Future studies should include ethnically diverse and low health care access populations, which are shown to be at higher risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 2, 2022.\n\nPublished: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.21050\n\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Crotty BH et al.

        "text": "Vaccine authorization Vaccine authorization\n\nWhat processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness?\n\nAny vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues.\n\nThe American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process.\n\nWhat information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"?\n\nData and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA.\n\nData to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following:\n\nChemistry, manufacturing and controls information\n\nNonclinical data and information\n\nClinical data and information\n\nAdministrative and regulatory information\n\nHow does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take?\n\nThe FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA.\n\nAre mRNA vaccines safe?\n\nmRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.\n\nThere are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.\n\nMore information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC.\n\nVaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution\n\nHow will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)?\n\nInitial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers.\n\nTribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service.\n\nHow can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution?\n\nThe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped.\n\nWhen will vaccine be distributed to physician offices?\n\nIn April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step.\n\nVaccine administration Vaccine administration\n\nWhat do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nTo receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll.\n\nWhat vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine providers are required to:\n\nStore and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance.\n\nMonitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit.\n\nComply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions.\n\nMonitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates.\n\nPreserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years.\n\nComply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses.\n\nWhat will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits?\n\nAncillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine.\n\nNeedles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult)\n\nSyringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL)\n\nAlcohol prep pads, 210 per kit\n\nFour surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit\n\nVaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More\n\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs.\n\nNote that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use.\n\nIs there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration?\n\nCDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies.\n\nData reporting Data reporting\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting.\n\nVaccine safety Vaccine safety\n\nWhat additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization?\n\nAfter a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety.\n\nVAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not)\n\nSerious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event)\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nPhysicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events.\n\nIf a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter.\n\nClinical considerations Clinical considerations\n\nWhat are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)?\n\nThere is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of TTS?\n\nTTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae.\n\nWhat is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIf TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS.\n\nFor more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology.\n\nWhat allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19?\n\nContraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose.\n\nFor people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people?\n\nPregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.\n\nClinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway\n\nor planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19.\n\nWhat is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines?\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults.\n\nWhat is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients?\n\nImmunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people.\n\nBased on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPeople should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines?\n\nData are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection.\n\nBuilding vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence\n\nHow can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.\n\nExamples:"

        "text": "Vaccine authorization Vaccine authorization\n\nWhat processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness?\n\nAny vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues.\n\nThe American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process.\n\nWhat information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"?\n\nData and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA.\n\nData to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following:\n\nChemistry, manufacturing and controls information\n\nNonclinical data and information\n\nClinical data and information\n\nAdministrative and regulatory information\n\nHow does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take?\n\nThe FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA.\n\nAre mRNA vaccines safe?\n\nmRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.\n\nThere are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.\n\nMore information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC.\n\nVaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution\n\nHow will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)?\n\nInitial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers.\n\nTribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service.\n\nHow can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution?\n\nThe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped.\n\nWhen will vaccine be distributed to physician offices?\n\nIn April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step.\n\nVaccine administration Vaccine administration\n\nWhat do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nTo receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll.\n\nWhat vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine providers are required to:\n\nStore and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance.\n\nMonitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit.\n\nComply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions.\n\nMonitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates.\n\nPreserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years.\n\nComply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses.\n\nWhat will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits?\n\nAncillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine.\n\nNeedles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult)\n\nSyringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL)\n\nAlcohol prep pads, 210 per kit\n\nFour surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit\n\nVaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More\n\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs.\n\nNote that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use.\n\nIs there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration?\n\nCDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies.\n\nData reporting Data reporting\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting.\n\nVaccine safety Vaccine safety\n\nWhat additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization?\n\nAfter a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety.\n\nVAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not)\n\nSerious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event)\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nPhysicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events.\n\nIf a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter.\n\nClinical considerations Clinical considerations\n\nWhat are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)?\n\nThere is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of TTS?\n\nTTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae.\n\nWhat is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIf TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS.\n\nFor more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology.\n\nWhat allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19?\n\nContraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose.\n\nFor people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people?\n\nPregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.\n\nClinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway\n\nor planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19.\n\nWhat is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines?\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults.\n\nWhat is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients?\n\nImmunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people.\n\nBased on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPeople should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines?\n\nData are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection.\n\nBuilding vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence\n\nHow can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.\n\nExamples:"

        "text": "Since its emergence, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. This rise in COVID-19 cases has strained hospitals and emergency departments across the United States, increasing the demand for treatments. While there is an ongoing need for people to get vaccinated\u2014and boosted\u2014against COVID-19, two antiviral oral treatments are available in limited supplies, but patient confusion still remains about who is eligible and how these treatments work.\n\nWhat you need to know about COVID-19 Explore top articles, videos, research highlights and more from the AMA\u2014your source for clear, evidence-based news and guidance during the pandemic. See the Latest Updates\n\nLast month, the two oral antivirals\u2014Paxlovid (PDF) and molnupiravir (PDF)\u2014were authorized for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 under emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Learn what COVID-19 treatments are FDA authorized, and what works.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious disease specialist, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills.\n\nThere are two options There are two options\n\n\u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she added, noting that when this antiviral enters the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently authorized for use in all adult patients and in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d\n\nThey prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death\n\nWhile data is still limited, \u201cin one study that was cited in the EUA, Paxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d\n\nThe pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure\n\n\u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, the EUA for these two medications really only covers those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said.\n\nRelated Coverage What physicians need to know about COVID-19 clinical therapeutics\n\nSevere COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care\n\n\u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nPaxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets\n\nAs a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tables of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nMolnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules\n\n\u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said.\n\nSome side effects are expected Some side effects are expected\n\n\u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness.\u201d\n\nShare what medications you\u2019re taking Share what medications you\u2019re taking\n\n\u201cPaxlovid, because it has that boosting medication ritonavir as one of its components, creates potential drug interactions,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor anybody who receives a prescription for Paxlovid, they should make sure that their physician reviews all of the patient\u2019s other medications that they are taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat includes over-the-counter medications and supplements or other non-prescription medications that they take, to check for any drug interactions,\u201d she added, noting \u201cit\u2019s easiest to do that through certain drug interaction tools for which physicians will have access.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany patients don\u2019t think to mention medications that they\u2019re taking that are non-prescription or that may be supplements, but everything should be mentioned to their physicians,\u201d said Dr. Choi.\n\nSupplies are limited Supplies are limited\n\n\u201cThe demand is just outstripping the supply for these oral antivirals right now due to the quickly spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi, noting that \u201cmost of the access for these medications are being directed by the state health departments to specific local health departments, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and physician offices.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all physicians will be able to get these medications on demand for their patients\u2014there\u2019s a lot of state-to-state variability,\u201d she said.\n\nConsult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant\n\n\u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area and treatments for COVID-19 infection are limited,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d\n\nNot everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills\n\n\u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d\n\nGet vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted\n\n\u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We have so much more vaccine available than antivirals, currently, and prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d which means two doses of a mRNA vaccine and a booster shot..\n\n\u201cIf they have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine but have not received their COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to get their booster dose\u201d when eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines and boosters work against the Omicron variant, and they will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated and boosted as completely as possible against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVisit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics."

        "text": "Some studies suggest that the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as a heart attack or stroke, remains high even many months after a SARS-CoV-2 infection clears up. Researchers are starting to pin down the frequency of these issues and what is causing the damage.\n\nAdapted from Yukon Haughton by Nik Spencer/Nature\n\nIn December 2020, a week before cardiologist Stuart Katz was scheduled to receive his first COVID-19 vaccine, he came down with a fever. He spent the next two weeks wracked with a cough, body aches and chills. After months of helping others to weather the pandemic, Katz, who works at New York University, was having his own first-hand experience of COVID-19.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Katz\u2019s acute illness finally subsided. But many symptoms lingered, including some related to the organ he\u2019s built his career around: the heart. Walking up two flights of stairs would leave him breathless, with his heart racing at 120 beats per minute. Over the next several months, he began to feel better, and he\u2019s now back to his normal routine of walking and cycling. But reports about COVID-19\u2019s effects on the cardiovascular system have made him concerned about his long-term health. \u201cI say to myself, \u2018Well, is it really over?\u2019\u201d Katz says.\n\nIn one study1 this year, researchers used records from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to estimate how often COVID-19 leads to cardiovascular problems. They found that people who had had the disease faced substantially increased risks for 20 cardiovascular conditions \u2014 including potentially catastrophic problems such as heart attacks and strokes \u2014 in the year after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Researchers say that these complications can happen even in people who seem to have completely recovered from a mild infection.\n\nSome smaller studies have mirrored these findings, but others find lower rates of complications. With millions or perhaps even billions of people having been infected with SARS-CoV-2, clinicians are wondering whether the pandemic will be followed by a cardiovascular aftershock. Meanwhile, researchers are trying to understand who is most at risk of these heart-related problems, how long the risk persists and what causes these symptoms.\n\nIt\u2019s a gaping hole in an important area of public health, says Katz. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand if this changes the lifelong trajectory for risk of a heart attack or stroke or other cardiac events \u2014 we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d Here, Nature looks at the questions that scientists are asking and the answers they\u2019ve uncovered so far.\n\nHow many people are at risk?\n\nDoctors have reported cardiovascular problems related to COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, but concerns over this issue surged after the results of the VA study came out earlier this year. The analysis by Ziyad Al-Aly, an epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and his colleagues is one of the most extensive efforts to characterize what happens to the heart and circulatory system after the acute phase of COVID-19. The researchers compared more than 150,000 veterans who had recovered from acute COVID-19 with their uninfected peers, as well as with a pre-pandemic control group1.\n\nPeople who had been admitted to intensive care with acute infections had a drastically higher risk of cardiovascular problems during the next year (see \u2018Cardiac concerns\u2019). For some conditions, such as swelling of the heart and blood clots in the lungs, the risk shot up at least 20-fold compared with that in uninfected peers. But even people who had not been hospitalized had increased risks of many conditions, ranging from an 8% increase in the rate of heart attacks to a 247% increase in the rate of heart inflammation.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nFor Al-Aly, the study added to the growing body of evidence that a bout of COVID-19 can permanently alter some people\u2019s health. These kinds of change fall under the category of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which covers problems that emerge after an initial infection. This disorder includes \u2014 and overlaps with \u2014 the persistent condition known as long COVID, a term that has many definitions.\n\nStudies indicate that the coronavirus is associated with a wide range of lasting problems, such as diabetes2, persistent lung damage3 and even brain damage4. As with these conditions, Al-Aly says that the cardiovascular issues that occur after a SARS-CoV-2 infection can decrease a person\u2019s quality of life over the long term. Treatments do exist for these problems, \u201cbut they are not curable conditions\u201d, he adds.\n\nDespite its large size, the VA study does come with caveats, say researchers. The study is observational, meaning that it reuses data that were collected for other purposes \u2014 a method that can introduce biases. For example, the study considers only veterans, meaning that the data are skewed towards white men. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have any study like it that goes into more diverse and a younger population,\u201d says Eric Topol, a genomicist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. He thinks that more research is needed before scientists can truly quantify the frequency at which cardiovascular problems strike.\n\nDaniel Tancredi, a medical statistician at the University of California, Davis, points out another potential source of bias. One of the control groups in the VA study had to get through more than a year without catching SARS-CoV-2 to be included in the study. There could be physiological differences that made the control group less likely to contract the disease, which could also affect their susceptibility to cardiovascular problems. Still, Tancredi thinks the study was well designed and that any bias is likely to be minimal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that these numbers are exactly right, but they\u2019re definitely in the ballpark,\u201d he says. He hopes future prospective studies will fine-tune Al-Aly\u2019s estimates.\n\nSome other studies do point in the same direction. Data from the England\u2019s health-care system5, for example, show that people who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 were about three times more likely than uninfected people to face major cardiovascular problems within eight months of their hospitalization. A second study6 found that, in the 4 months after infection, people who had had COVID-19 had a roughly 2.5-fold increased risk of congestive heart failure compared with those who had not been infected.\n\nHealth modeller Sarah Wulf Hanson at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle used Al-Aly\u2019s data to estimate how many heart attacks and strokes COVID-19 has been associated with. Her unpublished work suggests that, in 2020, complications after COVID-19 caused 12,000 extra strokes and 44,000 extra heart attacks in the United States, numbers that jumped up to 18,000 strokes and 66,000 heart attacks in 2021. This means that COVID-19 could have increased the rates of heart attack by about 8% and of stroke by about 2%. \u201cIt is sobering,\u201d Wulf Hanson says.\n\nIndirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as missed medical appointments, stress and the sedentary nature of isolating at home probably further contributed to the cardiovascular burden for many people, scientists suggest.\n\nThese numbers don\u2019t match what some researchers have seen in the clinic, however. In a small study7 of 52 people, Gerry McCann, a cardiac-imaging specialist at the University of Leicester, UK, and his colleagues found that people who had recovered after being hospitalized with COVID-19 had no greater rate of heart disease than did a group of people who had similar underlying conditions but remained uninfected. The trial was orders of magnitude smaller than Al-Aly\u2019s, but McCann and his colleagues are working on a larger study with around 1,200 participants. The results have yet to be published, but McCann says \u201cthe more data we\u2019re acquiring, the less impressed we are with the degree of, let\u2019s say, myocardial injury\u201d, or heart problems.\n\nDespite having an incomplete picture of COVID-19\u2019s cardiovascular effects, doctors recommend caution. An expert panel convened by the American College of Cardiology advises doctors to test people who have had COVID-19 for cardiovascular problems if they have risk factors such as being older or immunosuppressed8.\n\nHow are researchers gathering more information?\n\nAnswers to many questions about the long-term impacts of COVID-19 could come from a large study called the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or RECOVER, project, which aims to follow 60,000 people for up to 4 years at more than 200 sites in the United States. The study will include participants with long COVID, people who were infected and have recovered, and others who were never infected. \u201cIt\u2019s enrolling across the lifespan,\u201d says Katz, who is the principal investigator of the trial. He and his colleagues plan to study children, adults, pregnant people and the infants who are born during the trial.\n\nMost RECOVER participants will fill out questionnaires about their health and undergo non-invasive tests. Researchers aim to collect extra information for about 20% of participants, for example, by temporarily inserting small tubes into adults\u2019 hearts to obtain localized measurements of indicators such as blood pressure and oxygen levels. After several years, scientists hope to have completed a catalogue of long-COVID symptoms, formed an understanding of who develops them and begun to understand why they occur.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, McCann leads the cardiovascular working group for a similar project called the Post-hospitalization COVID-19 study, or PHOSP-COVID. This multi-centre study focuses on people who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and aims to uncover the prevalence of lasting symptoms, who is most at risk and how the virus causes lingering health problems. Thus far, the group has found that only about one-quarter of people who were hospitalized feel fully recovered one year after infection. And the team has identified immune markers that are associated with the worst cases of long COVID9.\n\nHow does the virus harm the heart?\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s effect on the heart could be related to the key protein that the virus uses to enter cells. It binds to a protein called ACE2, which can be found on the surfaces of dozens of types of human cell. This, says Al-Aly, gives it \u201caccess and permission to enter almost any cell in the body\u201d.\n\nWhen the virus enters the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, Topol says, that\u2019s probably where many cardiovascular problems start. Blood clots form naturally to heal damage caused while the body clears the infection. These clots can clog blood vessels, leading to damage as minor as leg pain or as severe as a heart attack. A study10 based on more than 500,000 COVID-19 cases found that people who had been infected had a 167% higher risk of developing a blood clot in the two weeks after infection than people who had had influenza. Robert Harrington, a cardiologist at Stanford University in California, says that even after the initial infection, plaques can accumulate where the immune response has damaged the lining of blood vessels, causing the vessels to narrow. This can lead to problems, such as heart attacks and strokes, even months after the initial wound has healed. \u201cThose early complications can definitely translate into later complications,\u201d Harrington says.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 could also leave its fingerprints on the immune system. When Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and her colleagues characterized antibodies from hospitalized people during the acute phase of COVID-19, they found a plethora of antibodies against human tissue11. Iwasaki suspects that when SARS-CoV-2 ramps up someone\u2019s immune system, it might inadvertently activate immune cells that attack the body \u2014 cells that stay quiet when the immune system isn\u2019t in overdrive. These immune cells could damage many organs, including the heart.\n\nDamage to blood vessels can compound attacks on the immune system. \u201cYou can think of this damage as accumulating over time,\u201d says Iwasaki. When the cardiovascular system has been assaulted on enough fronts, that\u2019s when people can experience serious consequences, such as a stroke or heart attack.\n\nWhat about reinfection and new variants?\n\nVaccinations, reinfections and the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 all pose new questions about the virus\u2019s cardiovascular effects. A paper published in May by Al-Aly and his colleagues suggests that vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of developing these long-term problems12.\n\nHanson is also eager to model whether reinfections compound the risk and whether the relatively mild \u2014 but widespread \u2014 Omicron variant will affect the cardiovascular system as drastically as other variants. \u201cWe are kind of chomping at the bit for follow-up data among Omicron cases,\u201d she says."

        "text": "Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)3, and SARS-CoV-14 vary in their transmissibility and pathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantial apoptosis in cell culture5-7 and in patient tissues8-10, suggesting a potential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstrate that caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating N fragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virus replication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves the survival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV MA )-infected human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a component of the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication."

        "text": "NEWS AND VIEWS\n\n03 August 2022 Genetic variants that edit risk of autoimmune diseases A process called A-to-I RNA editing helps to prevent unwanted immune responses. Associations between genetic variants and this type of RNA editing now provide mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of autoimmune diseases. Kaur Alasoo 0 Kaur Alasoo Kaur Alasoo is at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, 51009 Tartu, Estonia. View author publications You can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar\n\nThe genetic variants that increase the risk of disease do so by exerting effects on RNA. Variants can alter the amount of RNA produced from a given gene. They can alter the transcribed RNA sequence itself, leading to changes either in the amino-acid sequence of the encoded protein or in how much of the RNA is removed through \u2018splicing\u2019 before it is translated into protein. Finally, variants can influence whether RNA molecules undergo A-to-I RNA editing1 \u2014 a process in which a subunit of RNA is changed from adenosine (A) to inosine (I). Writing in Nature, Li et al.2 present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of genetic variants on A-to-I RNA editing. Their work provides new insights into the mechanisms by which genetic variants mediate the risk of some immune-related diseases.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01641-y\n\nReferences Eisenberg, E. & Levanon, E.

        "text": "From London to Shanghai, unprecedented heatwaves have scorched many parts of the world in recent weeks. In June, Tokyo baked through nine consecutive days above 35 \u00baC, its most severe heatwave since official tallies began in the 1870s. In mid-July, the United Kingdom shattered records as temperatures soared above 40 \u00baC for the first time since measurements started. Meanwhile, heat-fuelled wildfires ravaged parts of France, Spain, Greece and Germany. And China has faced multiple widespread heatwaves, including one that hit more than 400 cities last week.\n\nClimate scientists have long warned that heatwaves will strike more frequently and with higher temperatures as the world warms. But the future has arrived faster than researchers had feared, particularly in Western Europe, which is a hotspot for heatwaves, according to research published last month1. These aren\u2019t just more and more-powerful heatwaves \u2014 they are record-shattering heatwaves that have defied expectations derived from climate models.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to dissect the details of this year\u2019s heatwaves, to better understand how extreme heat will affect society going forwards.\n\n\u201cThe science community has obviously been thinking about the possibility of these events,\u201d says Eunice Lo, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol, UK, who has studied the UK heatwave. But \u201cit was still quite surreal that it actually happened\u201d.\n\nLethal heat\n\nExtreme heat is one of the more deadly consequences of global warming. It kills people directly, such as those working outdoors. And it overloads energy grids, disrupting electricity supplies at times when people most need air conditioning or fans to survive in overheated homes. A heatwave in Europe in 2003 is estimated to have killed more than 70,000 people. And heatwaves can also exacerbate other disasters, such as wildfires, and exact a high toll on mental health.\n\nAlthough heatwaves have been getting worse in the past few years, studies of the most extreme examples leapt forward after a June 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.\n\nThat heatwave was so far off the charts that it essentially reset the field of research on extreme heat, says Vikki Thompson, a climate scientist at Bristol. In a study published in May, she and her colleagues showed2 that only five heatwaves recorded anywhere in the world since 1960 had been more extreme, as measured by departure from the climate of the previous decade. Just looking at temperature records across the Pacific Northwest from the years before the event, it seemed \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d that such a record-breaking heatwave could occur, she says. And yet it did \u2014 driven mainly by a high-pressure atmospheric system that funnelled in hot air, combined with drier-than-normal soil conditions across much of the region.\n\nDefying expectations\n\nThis July\u2019s heatwave in the United Kingdom was not quite so severe, but it might still go down in history as the event that shook a nation into awareness of the dangers of extreme heat. On 18 and 19 July, a broad swathe of the country set new temperature records, in many cases a full 3 or 4 \u00baC higher than the previous one (see \u2018Hotter extremes\u2019). Forty-six weather stations broke the nation\u2019s previous record high temperature of 38.7 \u00baC, which was set just three years ago. Hundreds of people are estimated to have died.\n\nScientists had foreseen this to some extent. A climate-modelling study published two years ago found that it was possible, although not likely, that the United Kingdom would pass 40 \u00baC in the coming decades3. And yet it happened this year, with a new national high of 40.3 \u00baC.\n\nThe fact that temperatures topped the threshold so much more quickly than expected might stem from the reality that climate models don\u2019t capture everything that influences heatwaves, and thus don\u2019t project future heat extremes completely accurately4. Changes in factors including land use and irrigation affect heatwaves in ways that models don\u2019t entirely account for yet. That means that model projections can sometimes misjudge the true impact of climate change.\n\nA 28 July analysis by the international World Weather Attribution research group found that human-induced climate change made this year\u2019s UK heatwave at least ten times more likely5. The study also concluded that the heatwave would have been 2\u20134 \u00baC cooler in the absence of global warming.\n\n\u201cIt is more evidence that there are some things we\u2019re probably not catching with the models,\u201d says Peter Stott, a climate scientist at the Met Office, the UK national weather service in Exeter, who was a co-author of the 2020 study about the United Kingdom3. \u201cThere is a research question there.\u201d\n\nLike the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021, the UK heatwave of 2022 might become a catalyst for understanding what causes heatwaves to become even more extreme than expected, says Erich Fischer, a climate scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. In a modelling study published last year6, Fischer and his colleagues projected that, in the coming decades, climate extremes will break previous records by wide margins. \u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d he says.\n\nStudying the extent to which extremes shatter records, and not just whether they pass the mark, can help local officials to plan for the types of extreme they might expect in the near future, Fischer argues.\n\nDynamic change\n\nBeyond the United Kingdom, much of Europe has already experienced several heatwaves this year. In fact, the continent has seen record heat several times over the past five years, says Kai Kornhuber, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York City. He was part of the team that identified Western Europe as particularly prone to heatwaves1. Over the past four decades, extreme heat has been increasing at rates three to four times faster there than in other mid-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThat could be because the atmospheric jet stream that flows east across the North Atlantic Ocean often breaks into two separate strands as it approaches Europe. When that happens, the strands can funnel storms away from Europe and allow heatwaves to develop and persist. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether climate change is leading to more of these \u2018double jets\u2019, but that pattern set up this July\u2019s heatwave in Western Europe and is responsible for many of the other recent heat events there.\n\nSimilar patterns of atmospheric dynamics might turn out to be important in revealing the factors that make heat events even more extreme than expected, says Kornhuber.\n\nSynchronized waves\n\nAnother striking feature of the past few months is that extreme heat has occurred simultaneously in several parts of the world (see \u2018In the red\u2019). China and western North America were both roasting in hotter-than-normal temperatures in late July, at the same time as Europe. Such concurrent heatwaves became six times more common in the Northern Hemisphere between 1979 and 2019, a study published in February found7.\n\nOne reason might be atmospheric patterns called Rossby waves that settle into a snaking shape around the entire planet, setting up stagnant patterns of weather in certain locations, which then become prone to extreme heat8. Those might or might not be becoming more common under global warming. But the sheer chance of having simultaneous heatwaves, unrelated to atmospheric patterns, does go up as the climate warms, says Deepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University in Vancouver. \u201cThe entire world is warming, and just the likelihood of having extreme heat regions is increasing,\u201d she says.\n\nHeatwaves are also coming earlier in the year in some places, such as India and Pakistan, which experienced baking temperatures from March to May. Parts of India passed 44 \u00baC at the end of March, well before the usual hottest part of the year. At least 90 people died. The heatwave was made 30 times more likely by climate change, the World Weather Attribution group found9.\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, climate scientists are reiterating the importance of both cutting carbon emissions and increasing people\u2019s ability to adapt to extreme temperatures. The UK heatwave was a major wake-up call about the nation\u2019s vulnerability to extreme heat, says Stott. After decades working on climate projections for the future, what startled him most was to see wildfires raging in London\u2019s urban area, fuelled by the extreme heat. \u201cIt was very sobering, really, and shocking that this was happening.\u201d"

        "text": "A glow undetectable to the human eye permeates the universe. This light is the remnant signature of the cosmic beginning \u2014 a dense, hot fireball that burst forth and created all mass, energy, and time. The primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has since traveled some 13.8 billion years through the expanding cosmos to our telescopes on Earth and above it.\n\nBut the CMB isn\u2019t just light. It holds within it an incredible wealth of knowledge that astronomers have been teasing out for the past few decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the earliest view we have of the universe,\u201d Princeton University cosmologist Joanna Dunkley previously explained to Astronomy. \u201cAnd it gives us so much information because all the things that we now see out in space \u2014 the galaxies, the clusters of galaxies \u2014 the very earliest seeds of those, we see in this CMB light.\u201d\n\nExtracting these clues from the CMB has taken multiple generations of telescopes on the ground, lofted into the atmosphere, and launched into space. In the mid-1960s, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB\u2019s pervasive microwave static across the sky, it appeared identical everywhere. It would take satellites launched above Earth\u2019s obscuring atmosphere to map that microwave glow to precisions on the order of millionths of a degree. Specifically, three satellites \u2014 COBE, WMAP, and Planck \u2014 revealed that our current cosmos, which is complex and filled with clusters of galaxies, stars, planets, and black holes, evolved from a surprisingly simple early universe.\n\nIn this week's episode of Infinity & Beyond, host Abigail Bollenbach will walk you through the basics of the cosmic microwave background, the universe's oldest baby picture.\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest space and astronomy news, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter."

We remain optimistic that there will not be a large amount of severe COVID , due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections.\n\n, due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections. Our recommendations: It is not necessary to implement mask or social distancing mandates at this time. National surveillance systems should track the underlying cause of hospital admissions.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nRising COVID-positive hospital admissions in the US\n\nIn some jurisdictions in the US, there are rising reported hospital admissions with COVID, and in some cases, examples of rising deaths. This has caused considerable policy discussion about whether it is time to reinstate mandates, such as the consideration of mask mandates in LA County.\n\nThe challenge that we have in understanding what's happening with BA.5 is that this is a very common infection. We see lots of evidence of considerable transmission in the community that is not translating into a big surge in reported cases, largely because we believe there is so much rapid antigen testing at home.\n\nMany COVID hospitalizations are incidental\n\nWe do see rising numbers of hospital admissions, and the challenge \u2013 as we've spoken about before \u2013 is distinguishing incidental, that is people coming to the hospital with some other problem, who happened to be COVID-positive when they get tested, from true COVID admissions. Unfortunately, in this country we don't have data on COVID admissions where they are positive for COVID and that's the reason for admission. Some hospital systems are reporting this.\n\nThere are reports from USC, for example, in LA County, that fully 90% of hospital admissions are incidental, meaning it is quite possible that we don't have reason to be that concerned about BA.5 transmission.\n\nRead more in Nature \u00bbHeart disease after COVID: what the data say\n\nUnlikely to be many cases of severe COVID\n\nIt could well be, because of high levels of immunity in the population from vaccination and from past infection, and quite widespread use of Paxlovid, if we look at the data in the US, that there isn't really cause for concern that there's going to be a large amount of severe COVID. This means, perhaps, that it is not the time, at this point, to be considering imposition of new mandates such as mask mandates or social distancing mandates.\n\nThe situation globally\n\nThis is a phenomenon we're seeing in other countries as well \u2013 it's not unique to the United States. There are reports from New Zealand, for example, in the last few days, of a marked increase in daily deaths. And again, this challenge is there, as well as in many countries in Europe \u2013 Norway is another example \u2013 where incidental from underlying is not being distinguished. It could well be just that BA.5 is a very common infection.\n\nThe only way we're going to resolve this for the future is if national surveillance systems make the effort to track hospitalizations and distinguish them by the underlying cause of admission.\n\nWe remain reasonably positive and optimistic about the course of BA.5 in the US and elsewhere. We do see early signs that it may have peaked already in the US and is starting to come down \u2013 that's not true for every state, but in general it does seem to be following the course that we've seen in other countries around the world.\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.5 is surging around the world, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. We anticipate waves to last around four to six weeks, based on other locations\u2019 experiences.\n\nparticularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. There are several new challenges for accurately tracking the pandemic: More people are using at-home tests and not reporting infections to public health authorities, making it difficult to gather accurate case counts. Countries have different requirements for COVID testing upon hospital admission, leading to variation in rates of hospitalization due to COVID, compared to incidental cases.\n\nOur policy recommendations: Encourage booster shots. Make antivirals available to all, particularly those in low-resource settings. High-risk individuals should consider social distancing and masking as transmission increases. Do not focus on getting vaccines to those who have never been vaccinated.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.5 surges around the world\n\nIn this week\u2019s COVID update from IHME, we\u2019re looking at the surges around the world \u2013 particularly in North America, Latin America, and most of Europe \u2013 that are traced to the combination of mobility levels being above pre-COVID levels, mask use globally down to 16% or less, and of course the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron.\n\nInterpreting the data has new challenges\n\nIt is becoming increasingly challenging to make complete sense of the COVID-19 surges in different countries, as we see very different biases in different countries coming into reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths.\n\nFor reported cases, we're seeing very modest to no increase in some countries in Europe, as compared to hospitalizations. Same in the United States. And we believe that's because of the widespread use of rapid antigen tests at home and in most countries people not reporting that to the public health authorities. They don't get into official case numbers.\n\nIn contrast, for hospital admissions \u2013 if you want an extreme example of this disconnect, look at Norway, where hospital admissions have gone up dramatically and yet cases have gone up only slightly. But for hospital admissions, most countries have required COVID testing for all patients, at least most high-income countries, meaning that you detect a quite substantial number of individuals who have COVID, but have gone to hospital for some other reason. We tend to call these \"incidental\" COVID admissions.\n\nThe degree to which there will be incidental COVID admissions depends on how much transmission there is broadly in the community. So we should expect under Omicron, the problem of incidental hospital admissions is dramatically larger than with a much more severe variant, such as Delta in the past, where there was less transmission in the community, and those coming to hospital who were COVID-positive were much more likely to be there simply because of symptoms of COVID.\n\nSo, challenging interpretation. And if you want to have a contrast to Norway, look at Mexico, where the increase in reported cases is dramatically higher than the increase in hospital admissions. We don't know if that's because there isn't the same testing requirement, of universal testing for COVID for hospital admissions, or if there is less home use of tests. Either way, it's becoming quite a bit harder to make sense of the available data.\n\nShould we be very concerned about BA.5?\n\nProbably not. In the places that started earlier \u2013 South Africa, Portugal \u2013 that had their BA.5 waves begin before other locations, we've seen from the beginning to the peak, it lasts about four to six weeks. So in many cases where countries are three-four weeks into these surges, we do think that we will see \u2013 and the models tend to back up that observation \u2013 we do expect to see peaks coming in the near future. Meaning that there isn't a reason to be particularly alarmed about BA.5,\n\nOur long-range models also suggest in the Northern Hemisphere that we may \u2013 in the absence of a new variant that changes the whole story \u2013 we might expect to see a further winter or late fall Omicron wave start up again in October, and that would be a pattern that we saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhether that happens depends very much on this balance between waning immunity from prior vaccination \u2013 so whether or not people get a fourth booster in places where they have access to that, whether they want a fourth booster \u2013 versus waning immunity from infection and the protection provided from infection with Omicron for either other subvariants or future variants. All of that means to say that it's possible that we have a late-fall surge again from Omicron because of waning immunity.\n\nGovernment policy recommendations\n\nThe strategies available for governments right now are less on getting people who have never been vaccinated, vaccinated. The data out there suggest very few people anywhere in the world who want to be vaccinated have not been, even in low-resource settings. As opposed to the available strategies, which might focus more on getting those who are willing to be vaccinated, who have been previously vaccinated, getting a further booster to enhance their protection against severe disease as that also wanes over time; broader use of antivirals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and then, for those individuals who are at particularly high risk, consideration of social distancing and masking as transmission in your community goes up.\n\nAs a backdrop to all of those strategies, the thing that we are learning, that is, two and a half years into this pandemic, is just how important surveillance is. Paradoxically, in many ways, the data stream that we have today is worse than a year ago because of some of the issues that I started with in this video about home testing, and different definitions of incidental versus underlying COVID for both hospitalization and death. So, very challenging on the surveillance side, but absolutely critical that we keep monitoring the pandemic and trying to do it in as comparable a fashion as possible, and particularly keeping track of new variants. That's our roundup of what we see in our analysis this week in the release of our new forecasts.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nIn the United States , COVID is currently on the decline, but BA.4 and BA.5 could change that. Why? Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Previous infection provides less immunity against BA.4 and BA.5. Mobility is increasing while mask wearing declines.\n\n, COVID is currently on the decline, but could change that. Our recommendations for the US: Individuals should get another COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine before the winter. States should secure antivirals, especially for those at high risk. Governments should continue screening for new variants.\n\nOn a global level, we see a rise in some European countries, including France, Germany, and the UK. The future is still unclear in China, but much of the population remains susceptible to severe infection.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 in the United States\n\nIn the United States, reported cases, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decline. This is the pattern we have seen in the northeastern states. It is spreading across the United States, and we project that this will continue all the way until the end of September, when we are expecting another wave.\n\nWe are concerned in the United States because of the fast spread of BA.4 and BA.5 \u2013 they are escape variants in that it seems from the new studies we are looking at, that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection of BA.4 and BA.5. They are still very effective in preventing severe illness and mortality, but we are concerned that with BA.4 and BA.5 spreading fast with the relaxation of mandates and with the patterns we are seeing in some European countries where there is a third wave, we are concerned that there is potential here for another bump or increase in cases in the coming months.\n\nWe will update our models the second week of July, and we will include all this new information in our models. We will then predict if we see a third wave or not, and how big it will be and how long it will last. In general, we're heading in the right direction in the United States.\n\nOur recommendations for the US\n\nWe're expecting a surge in winter, and the focus right now in the United States should be on vaccinating people and getting the booster, and then getting another vaccination before the winter, especially also with flu. We expect that flu season could be bad because we haven't seen flu in the past three years. Our recommendation would be to take another COVID-19 vaccine before winter and a flu vaccine.\n\nAlso, our recommendation is for every state to secure enough antivirals in order to make sure they are provided to infected people, especially those who are at high risk, elderly, and people with immunocompromise or with risk factors, chronic conditions, to make sure that we reduce the burden on our hospitals and we save lives.\n\nAnd, of course, continue screening and making sure that we don't lose track of what's circulating in our country, and if there is an increase in cases due to another variant or pre-existing variant, we take the measures that are necessary to stop the spread of this virus.\n\nCases rising in Europe\n\nOn the global level, what we are seeing right now is a rise in some European countries. We see a third wave, driven mainly by BA.4 and BA.5, and the relaxation of mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We see the third wave with an increasing number of reported cases, and we see it in France, in Germany, beginning of it in the UK, in Greece, in Israel.\n\nThat's a big concern for us because what has happened before in Europe has happened here in the United States, and we could see here in the United States a third wave, especially from BA.4 and BA.5, which are increasing as a percentage of the variants that are circulating.\n\nWe know right now from several studies that previous infections from other variants do not provide as much immunity against Omicron and BA.4 and BA.5. Also, the vaccines are less effective in terms of preventing infection. They're still effective against severe illness and mortality for BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nSo putting these two together, we are very much concerned that we could see potentially in the United States another wave after the second wave due to BA.4, BA.5, relaxation of the mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing.\n\nWe will update our numbers in July, most likely the second week due to the holiday, and we will take into account all this new information about the spread of BA.4 and BA.5 in Europe, and the new studies that are showing less effect of the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nFuture unclear in China\n\nChina remains a big mystery for us \u2013 we don't know what's going to happen in China. They're successful so far in containing the virus, but this could change as soon as they change their policy and open up the country because they have had fewer infections because of their success before, their vaccine is not as effective, and much of their elderly population is not vaccinated. So we could see a rise of cases in China as well.\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal infections are increasing : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States.

Ensure access to antivirals for vulnerable individuals.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nGlobal infections are increasing\n\nIn this week's release from IHME of our COVID forecasts, there are some key observations of what's happening around the world and what we see coming in the models. Globally, we're starting to see the estimated number of infections go up again, and that's driven by secondary Omicron waves in a number of places in sub-Saharan Africa, in a wide array of locations in Latin America, from Quintana Roo, other states in Mexico, through to a number of states in Brazil and all the way in between.\n\nThere are also some small increases in states in India, and perhaps most concerning is a quite substantial secondary wave of Omicron in Portugal, related to the BA.5 variant with an associated meaningful increase in the death rate, which we have not generally seen with these secondary Omicron waves in Europe and the northeast of the US. The last place where there is some secondary increase from Omicron is some of the Southern states in the US and some of the states in the Midwest.\n\nOmicron peak is expected in June\n\nDespite these increases, we remain reasonably sure in the modeling that they will peak sometime in June, given what we've seen in Europe with the secondary waves, and what we've seen in the northeast of the US, as well as what we saw with the BA.4-5 wave in South Africa. So we expect these to be short-lived, and to not really alter the global trajectory over the next few months.\n\nAn outbreak in China could have a major global impact\n\nThe big question mark remains, at the global level, what happens in China. We are assuming that strict lockdown measures will continue through to October, and that they will be, as they have been to date, successful. The reporting of 11 cases today in Shanghai will raise the real questions about the economic toll in China from the strict lockdown policies, but so far there's no indication of a change from the leadership in China.\n\n120,000 deaths expected globally by October 1\n\nPutting all that together in our forecasts, we do not see large numbers of deaths. Although when you add it up around the world, still about 120,000 deaths are to be expected between now and October 1.\n\nThe other insight that comes from the modeling is that we expect to see numbers starting to go back up again in the Northern Hemisphere in early September or late September, likely leading into increases \u2013 modest increases \u2013 in the fall.\n\nMask mandates in the US unlikely to have a big impact\n\nThere is some concern in parts of the US seeing secondary Omicron waves, such as in California, where some mandates have been put back in place, namely mask mandates, for example in Alameda county. As far as we can tell from both the modeling, as well as from the experience elsewhere of the secondary waves, we don't necessarily think that will have a big effect, nor is it necessary given the low infection-fatality rate and given the availability of antivirals, particularly, which should mean that we won't see a substantial increase in death.\n\nSome of the debate about this is getting still obscured, this many months into Omicron, because we are not getting good data that differentiates incidental hospitalizations \u2013 people coming to hospital with COVID-19, but that's not the reason for their hospitalization \u2013 from hospitalizations and deaths where COVID is the true cause. And without that it's very easy for a highly contagious and reasonably prevalent infection like Omicron to appear like the numbers are increasing substantially.\n\nContinuing surveillance for new variants and access to antivirals will be key\n\nClearly all of this optimistic view over the next few months at the global level is predicated on the idea that there will not be a new variant that has immune escape and is more severe than Omicron. But of course, that is a distinct possibility and it highlights why maintaining global surveillance \u2013 so that if such a variant emerges, the world knows about it as soon as possible \u2013 is really crucial, as is preparing for access for the vulnerable for antivirals, because that's likely in the future to be the strategy that will make the biggest difference if a new variant comes along.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal death toll declining: We are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.\n\nWe are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.

Policy recommendation: Monitor for new variants and be prepared to respond if a new, more dangerous one should emerge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Daily death toll declining globally This week at IHME in our update on COVID, we do not have a new model release. That will be coming next week, but we continue to monitor the pandemic. We are really reaching, at the global level, an extraordinarily low level of the impact of COVID. In fact, the death toll at the daily level has now reached the level we last saw around March 20, 2020. We continue to see this very favorable trend down. Low or declining cases in China, South Africa, Europe, and the US At the location level, the strict lockdown policy, zero-COVID strategy in China continues to work, although it has great economic effects. The reported cases, as far as we can tell in China, are now down to a very low level. We do expect in our modeling, and continue to expect, that it will be hard to sustain that, given the considerable number of susceptible individuals that are still in China. Elsewhere, where there were surges related to either BA.4 or BA.5 in South Africa, that's peaked and continues to decline. The BA.2 surges in Europe seem to have all peaked and are pretty much declining. Here in the US, as we expected, at the national level it appears that case reporting has peaked and is starting to come down, but of course that varies by location. The decline is more in the northeast. Other states are still on the upswing, but nationally we should start to see the numbers come down. We do continue to expect, in the absence of the emergence of a variant with considerable immune escape on Omicron, that we will see quite low numbers through the next few months. We must continue monitoring for new variants Of course, we've learned through the pandemic that the emergence of a new variant can completely change the story in a very quick manner. But for now, it does appear like those countries that are largely returning to pre-COVID levels of interaction and very low levels of mask use will continue to see low or even declining transmission, and certainly low or declining impacts in terms of death, given the slow but steady scale-up of the use of antivirals. So, there are very favorable conditions for the moment. We do believe it's important to keep up surveillance and to be ready on a country-by-country basis to respond with booster shots, with access to antivirals, and if a dangerous, high-severity new variant with immune escape emerged, to be able to reconsider other actions as well.

Of major areas of interest, in South Africa, the BA.4-5 related increase in cases has peaked and is coming down, which fits with the expectation that while there was some reduction in cross-variant immunity from BA.4-5 compared to previous waves of Omicron, it was not very large.\n\nOmicron under control in China\n\nLikewise, we're seeing that the measures put in place in China for strict lockdown, at least according to official data, continue to be successful, with case numbers coming down. Of course, the question will be whether or not there are going to be \u2013 as we expect, given the large volume of susceptible individuals \u2013 further Omicron outbreaks, and the need for other efforts at strict lockdown in China, still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases expected to peak in the US within a few weeks\n\nIn the United States, the increase in cases, probably driven by behavioral relaxation, seems to be slowing. There is a spatial heterogeneity aspect to this, but for example, in our own hospital system at the University of Washington, our number of hospital admissions has peaked and is starting to come down, as an example of a place with one of these surges.\n\nSo, as we've been expecting for many weeks, we do not think these current increases in the US will lead to large-scale increases in death, certainly, or hospitalization. We should see a peak about the end of May or early June at the national level.\n\nCurrent recommendations\n\nPending the emergence of new variants that are more severe than Omicron, the current strategies of continuing to offer boosters to those who would like to get a booster, making sure that antivirals are available for those who are at risk who do get infected with Omicron, and continuing surveillance, are the most important aspects of monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nRegional updates: China continues zero-COVID strategy and reports no increase in cases. South Africa may be reaching a peak of the BA.4/BA.5 winter surge. The United States is experiencing an increase in Omicron cases \u2013 likely due to behavioral changes, and possibly due to re-infection with BA.2 \u2013 but not an increase in deaths.\n\nMandates: We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China.\n\nWe do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. Cross-variant immunity: New research suggests limited immunity against other variants after Omicron infection. However, immunity from vaccination and previous infection does provide strong protection from severe illness and death.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nChina reports no increase in cases\n\nWe do not have updated models this week, but we continue to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic around the world. Areas of ongoing interest are the approach to zero-COVID in China, which continues. Officially reported cases are actually not increasing, and they're maybe coming down, but stringent mandates are in place in many locations. From experience in other countries, we do expect at some point that Omicron will spread widely in China, but it is very much a question of when \u2013 and when the government decides to stop pursuing this zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases increasing in South Africa and United States\n\nElsewhere in the world, we're seeing increases. The BA.4- and BA.5-related and winter-related increase in South Africa continues. It is certainly not as exponential as the original Omicron wave, but it does continue to increase. With some indication, it may be reaching a peak.\n\nIn the United States, Omicron continues to increase in a number of states. That increase, again, seems to be like what we've observed in many countries in Europe, related to behavioral relaxation and possibly BA.2 re-infection of people who have had a prior Omicron infection \u2013 although it's perhaps easiest to account for through behavioral change.\n\nMandates not expected to be reimplemented\n\nIn neither case, neither what we saw in Europe nor what we're so far seeing in the United States, are we seeing an increase in death, which is very good news. That's likely because there is either vaccine-derived or infection-acquired immunity, so that people aren't fully immunologically naive, and perhaps because of the increased use of antivirals when individuals do become sick, which should have a marked effect on the death rate. We don't, at this point, think that there's reason for large-scale concern and also do not expect, with few exceptions, that there will be implementation of mandates in these jurisdictions, outside the zero-COVID strategy in China.\n\nNew studies show limited immunity from Omicron infection\n\nOne of the critical factors that do go into the long-range modeling, and even the short-range, is the extent to which Omicron infection provides protection against subsequent new variants, or even sub-variants of Omicron. There was a paper in Nature this week, which is a lab-based paper, based on the immune responses from serum from different types of patients, which suggests that there may be a limited cross-variant protection from Omicron infection.\n\nRead more in Nature \u00bbLimited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination\n\nWe'll really want to wait and see when studies are able to start reporting, from actual infection in individuals, what sort of cross-variant immunity there is. Both from vaccine-derived immunity and infection-acquired immunity, the available studies suggest much lower protection against Omicron infection, pretty good protection against severe disease and death, but greatly reduced for infection. We'll have to wait and see whether that difference holds true for Omicron on Omicron by sub-variant, or even future variants, namely less protection against infection, but hopefully more protection against severe disease and death.\n\nThat issue will have a profound effect on what the fall and winter may look like, as we do expect waning immunity, both from vaccines and infection-acquired immunity, plus indoor exposure and opportunities for transmission, that there should be increased transmission potential in November, December, and January, and the extent to which there is long-range protection from severe disease and death will have a marked effect on outcomes.\n\nMay 16, 2022 - US reaches 1 million COVID deaths\n\nAs the United States reaches this somber milestone, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray reflects on the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how we can better prepare for future health threats.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nThe US has officially surpassed the awful milestone of a million reported deaths from COVID. This is a number that I think very few of us thought would ever come to pass when the pandemic started to break in February of 2020. In fact, back then we thought a concerted response would mean that the number would be a tenth of that, or even less.\n\nNow, the true number of deaths from COVID is even larger. We think, based on looking at excess deaths, it's probably closer to 1.3 million deaths that have already occurred in the US, but by either metric, it's a staggering number.\n\nCOVID has had a terrible toll, not just here in the US but around the world, with 6 million reported deaths and more than 18 million excess deaths; those deaths are distributed throughout the regions of the world and not just in North America or in Europe.\n\nWe've entered a new phase of the pandemic, a phase where Omicron is much milder and a large fraction of the world's population has been infected with Omicron. The Omicron story has still to play out in China and North Korea, but in general we're entering this phase where people are going back to pre-COVID levels of interaction. Mask use is declining dramatically, and I think that's going to be the new normal.\n\nWe will see continued Omicron transmission, and Omicron will come back in the winter if we don't see a new variant. But it's likely we will see a new variant, and so while we might think that the era of mandates and profound changes in behavior might be behind us, we certainly haven't seen the end of COVID-19.\n\nWe should be thinking about how we manage COVID-19 new variants as they emerge and the critical role of continued use of boosters, vaccinating those who are still willing to be vaccinated but haven't been, and the new tools that we have like Paxlovid and potential other antivirals as they come along. All those combined mean, even if we have a new variant, we don't expect it to be as bad as it has been, which is good news. But it should give us pause to recognize the threat that we live with in the future, for either some remarkable new variant that will break through our current tools entirely, or new pathogens and new pandemics in the future.\n\nHopefully, this extraordinary experience in the US will motivate the US government and other governments to invest in greater capabilities to respond to new threats; detect them earlier; have a more rational, thoughtful, but rapid response to those threats as they emerge; and then to figure out who are most vulnerable, whether it's the groups that are essential workers, or those that have some sort of comorbidity, or those that are elderly. Whatever it may be for a new threat, it's critical that we learn about protecting the most vulnerable for future rounds of threats as they emerge.\n\nAt this terrible milestone, it is an opportunity for us to reflect both on what went wrong and how we can solve and prepare ourselves better for future rounds of COVID and future threats.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nEast Asia: As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAs rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. United States: Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Short-term: We predict a small peak in May to early June, but no major surge until the winter. Long-term: We predict as many as 30% of the US population will get infected through the winter with Omicron due to declining immunity. However, we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nCases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Global: Data from South Africa do not indicate that BA.4 and BA.5 will lead to a major global surge. Our recommended strategy for dealing with COVID on a global scale is securing access to antivirals for all.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron and the zero-COVID strategy in East Asia\n\nLast week in IHME\u2019s updated forecasts, we certainly were trying to take into account what\u2019s unfolding in East Asia with continued rapid expansion of the Omicron epidemic in Taiwan, and that continues to expand. There\u2019s this very challenging question of how Omicron will play out in China. The government is pursuing their zero-COVID strategy with lockdowns as needed.\n\nWe have been expecting Omicron, since February, in our modeling to eventually break through these efforts because it has appeared that control efforts on Omicron have been generally less successful around the world than for previous variants. So far, these strict lockdown policies have kept Omicron numbers at a relatively low level.\n\nIt's extremely hard to understand how the policy environment will play out in China. If they pursue strict lockdowns, it's possible they will keep Omicron transmission at a relatively modest level through to the fall. We do believe that it is inevitable there will be a large Omicron outbreak at some point in China, because maintaining a strict zero-COVID strategy is probably unsustainable as the year progresses, but it's impossible to know when that change in policy will occur.\n\nIncreasing cases in the United States and predictions for the winter\n\nIn the US, we're seeing increases in a number of parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, and some of the West Coast, in cases and hospital admissions. This is a pattern that follows what we\u2019ve seen in Europe as people's behavior goes back to pre-COVID levels, and there is a little bit of transition to BA.2 and perhaps BA.4 and BA.5 as they continue to spread.\n\nWe do expect a modest increase in numbers. Our expectation is they will peak sometime in May or early June and then go back down. We don't expect a major surge from that. There have been reports from the White House of their efforts to model in the long term a large surge in infections.\n\nIn our long-range models, which we do not release publicly, we do expect in the winter a return Omicron surge. Of course if there's a new highly infectious variant that's more severe, that would trump this pattern we expect. We expect a surge in the winter because of declining immunity from exposure to Omicron, as well as declining immunity from vaccination and perhaps not as high a rate of repeat boosters as we've seen for the third dose, going into the future. The consequences of a winter surge in the US should be much smaller because of Paxlovid and increasing availability of antivirals and use of antivirals.\n\nWe certainly expect quite large numbers in the winter, not so much in the fall \u2013 perhaps as many as 30% of the US population getting infected through the winter with Omicron. But we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nWe don\u2019t expect much in the way of government mandates, given the much lower ICU admission rate and death rate that should occur with these new strategies, particularly antivirals.\n\nGlobal strategy should be ensuring access to antivirals for all\n\nAt the global level, there's been ongoing debate and concern about BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. There\u2019s not an exponential surge there; there's a very slow increase in numbers. We so far are not seeing any indication that BA.4 and BA.5 could be the driver of a major global surge in cases, but of course this warrants monitoring on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, in terms of general strategy globally, we've seemingly maxed out globally on the number of people who are unvaccinated that want to be vaccinated \u2013 as far as we can tell from the data, only about 3% of the world wants a vaccination that hasn\u2019t received one. A lot of that is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, but still it's not a large percentage of the population.\n\nPerhaps the main strategy to deal with future variants is making sure that anyone who needs antivirals will get access to antivirals. There's a lot in that, both in terms of production of Paxlovid and health system infrastructure, and response patterns so that when somebody needs it, they can get it whether they're in a low-resource or high-resource setting. Those are our main observations on the epidemic as it continues to unfold.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal: Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. 3.1% of the population who wants a vaccine has still not received one, most in Africa. We must ensure equity in distribution of antiviral medication. Eid El-Fitr celebrations in Islamic countries could lead to a small increase in cases.\n\nMortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. United States: Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. Home testing and delayed reporting of infections has made it more difficult to track COVID-19. We recommend: continuing surveillance for new variants, securing antiviral medication, preparing to return to mask use and physical distancing if another variant arises.\n\nReported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. China: The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. The current rise in Taiwan and previous surge in Hong Kong are warning signs of what could happen.\n\nThe large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nProjections and recommendations for the United States\n\nWe have increased our projections to September 1. Right now in the United States we are projecting 1.02 million deaths by September 1. That's an additional 29,000 deaths from May 2, when we ran our programs.\n\nFor the United States, the recommendations remain the same:\n\nWe need to continue our surveillance and make sure we are doing enough sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the United States, and if BA.4 and BA.5 are being introduced in the US and how fast they are spreading. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have enough antiviral medications in order to distribute them. We know from their clinical trials that they reduce hospitalization and mortality, and they will reduce the pressures on our hospitals. Third, which is very important, if we are seeing a rise due to another variant in the United States, we should go back to wearing masks and physical distancing.\n\nIn the United States we are seeing an increase in reported cases and hospitalizations. In some states, we are seeing the rate of increase in admissions to hospital is much higher than the rate of increase of reported cases. We believe that's due to the fact that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting to their counties and not using the local labs, so we are not capturing these cases.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 under study in South Africa\n\nWe are monitoring closely what's happening in South Africa, the infections with BA.4 and BA.5. We don't know yet if they are immune escape and they are infecting people that have been previously infected by BA.2. It's too early to tell, and the fact that many people in South Africa have been infected by Omicron 4-5 months ago, it's possible that the waning immunity is resulting in the infection from BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nChinese population remains susceptible, relying on zero-COVID policy\n\nAt the global level, mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. The global trends are mainly dominated by what's happening in China. Right now we are seeing a rise in cases in Taiwan. China is continuing with its zero-COVID policy and we feel that they will be able to control COVID-19 for a while. However, the economic pressure may not allow them to continue with such a policy.\n\nIf what we are seeing happen right now in Taiwan, or what happened previously in Hong Kong, will happen in China, we project a lot of mortality, unfortunately, and the surge will overwhelm the hospitals. Many older Chinese people are not vaccinated at the same level as other countries, and also the vaccines used in China are less effective than the vaccines used elsewhere, mRNA vaccines. So we would expect a major surge and a rise in mortality in China.\n\nVaccine and antiviral equity: we are not safe until all of us are safe\n\nBased on vaccination rates and our monitoring of people who are willing to take the vaccine, we estimate right now that about 3.1% of people globally who want to get the vaccine and are willing to get the vaccine, have not received it. The majority of them are in Africa. We need to make sure that people who want to get the vaccine are receiving them, who failed distribution, which countries should support poor countries to get the vaccine and vaccinate their population. Again, we're not safe until all of us are safe.\n\nThe most important thing moving forward right now globally is to ensure that the global distribution, like with vaccination, that global distribution for antivirals is going forward and countries can secure what they need from antiviral in order to provide it to people who are infected, to reduce hospitalization and mortality.\n\nProjections in Islamic countries following Eid El-Fitr\n\nWe are not projecting a rise in cases in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean region, WHO region, but we are concerned in many Islamic countries after Eid El-Fitr celebrations with all the mobility, and people are visiting each other and celebrating the holidays. It's possible in some of these countries the decline will slow down and it's possible in some countries that we'll see a small surge in the coming weeks due to the holidays and the celebration.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\nAt IHME, with our projections, our major challenge in the coming months is the delay in reporting. Many countries and many states have moved to weekly reporting and it's very hard for us to monitor the situation. The fact in the United States that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting their infections to the local health departments is making it hard for us to follow the epi-curve.\n\nWe are using admissions to hospitals, COVID-19 admissions, as our main indicator and some places like the United States, where we believe many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting those results to their local health department, we have lowered the infection-detection rate in order to make sure we'll be able to monitor these trends.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nOmicron will continue to spread in China. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAfter already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. Cases are increasing in Delhi, India, and South Africa. The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave?\n\nThe question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? A concerted policy push is needed to increase access to antivirals. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and now a rapid scale-up in production must follow.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron spreading in China\n\nThis week from IHME we are not releasing a new set of projections yet. With few exceptions, the epidemic is still continuing to track our forecasts from earlier in the month. The key areas to pay attention to right now are, first and foremost, what's happening in China with the Omicron wave spreading, most importantly to Beijing. Many other cities within China apparently are also under lockdowns or partial lockdowns.\n\nAs we have been noting for months pre-Olympics, it's really a question of time when Omicron will spread more widely in China, given how transmissible it is, given the comparatively lower efficacy of the vaccines used in China, and particularly this issue that the zero-COVID strategy may not actually work. But our understanding is that the government will pursue that strategy vigorously, at least until the fall. So, no real change in expectations there, but it simply will be a challenging question as to whether that strategy can hold out until the fall.\n\nIncreasing cases in India\n\nThe second area of concern that people have been tracking has been the steady uptick in cases in Delhi, India. The question is whether this is due to declining immunity from the prior Omicron wave or the possibility of one of the sub-variants of Omicron fueling transmission in Delhi. They have re-imposed their mask mandate, so we\u2019ll see if that has some effect on that one part of India and the surrounding state of Haryana having some increased transmission.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 variants in South Africa\n\nThe third area of concern is the uptick in South Africa associated with the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, a steady increase but not exponential. The question remains \u2013 is that because these sub-variants are more transmissible, or is it because they have immune escape over BA.1 and BA.2, which were there in South Africa and had become the predominant variants, or is it because of waning immunity, just through time. We are now, for South Africa, pretty much four months, or even four and a half in some provinces, after the peak of the Omicron wave.\n\nAccess to antivirals\n\nThe other main consideration globally around managing COVID, particularly in China and for the world, when new variants that are potentially more severe emerge, is access to Paxlovid. We\u2019ve started to finally see some policy discussion around the importance of availability and access to Paxlovid. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and the question is, will there be more rapid scale-up in production? We strongly believe that needs a concerted policy push, equivalent to the efforts to expand vaccination. We will certainly expect more from IHME as we run our models in the near future to reflect any new updates in the data as we\u2019ve been describing.\n\nDo you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about.\n\nAsk a question\n\n\n\nDue to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of Omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected].\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNew modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference.\n\nWe are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference.

Still unknown if lockdowns will prevent an Omicron surge in China. Low vaccination among the 80+ population could result in a huge death toll if an outbreak occurs.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nLockdowns and Omicron in China This week from IHME, we have not rerun our models. We have been spending time trying to understand the epidemic province by province in China. The key thing there as the outbreak continues to unfold in Shanghai with very broad-based transmission, is now reports of lockdown are confirmed by mobility data in many other cities within China. It remains to be seen whether the zero-COVID strategy will work to keep COVID, or the Omicron variant, from spreading very widely in China. What we do know is that vaccine coverage in the 80+ population in many provinces is quite low. If Omicron spreads widely, there is a real risk that what we saw in Hong Kong could re-occur in mainland China. That's something that we are watching very closely. Currently, our models are assuming that the success that China's had with the zero-COVID strategy controlling Omicron in February, around the time of the Olympics, could be replicated, but we're also hearing reports that the economic costs of this are rising. Cases on the rise in eastern United States For the United States, we're seeing rising case numbers in a number of eastern states. There's some suggestion of rising case numbers in other states as well. There has not been a precipitous rise in case numbers yet \u2013 this increase looks to be related to continued relaxation of behavior, combined with the BA.2 sub-variant. The good news there is we're not seeing an increase in deaths. But it does point out how critical in the US \u2013 and pretty much everywhere \u2013 access to antivirals is going to be. New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges While there continues to be a lot of discussion about access to vaccines in low- and middle-income countries and even discussion around boosters, there's perhaps not enough focus on making sure that people who need these highly effective antivirals like Paxlovid [can get them] in the future. This is somewhat important right now for the BA.2 sub-variant, but could be extremely important in the future as we imagine that there will be more infectious and potentially more severe variants that emerge during the course of this year. We have started to do some modeling of what would happen if a variant that was as severe as Delta came along with the transmission potential of Omicron, and in that setting, widespread access to an antiviral like Paxlovid really makes a profound difference in saving lives around the world. So a very high priority, both in the US and everywhere in the world, for thinking about health system delivery strategies and access to the drug itself, is that those who can benefit from an antiviral are going to get that antiviral. Expect more from us in the coming weeks as we continue to track the pandemic and try to model out how future scenarios unfold, both with what we know is currently occurring, but also potentially the emergence of new variants. Emergence of new sub-variants The last comment is on the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants in South Africa. They are replacing BA.2 and there is some increase in case numbers, but still modest so far, as distinct from what happened with BA.2. We're now four months or more into the peak of Omicron transmission, so some of that increase in BA.4 and BA.5 could be from waning immunity from what was established through the early Omicron wave in November and December in South Africa. But it\u2019s clearly another facet of the epidemic that will bear close monitoring. April 14, 2022 - Update from Dr. Ali Mokdad\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.2 surge is ending in Europe.

So we see a decline in reported cases right now in the UK, in Germany, in France. In the long run, we believe that the number of cases will keep declining all the way to next winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Surge predicted in China if precautions fail: only 30% of population currently immune The situation we are monitoring closely right now is what\u2019s happening in China. We believe the strict measures and the lockdown in China have been successful so far in containing the spread of the virus, but with Omicron being extremely contagious and spreading much faster than any previous variant we have encountered, we don\u2019t believe that China could contain the spread of Omicron for a long time. So we\u2019re expecting a rise of infections, reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in China if these measures that are in place right now are not successful in containing the spread of the virus. The reason we believe that for China \u2013 if you look at measures that China put in place, they were so effective at preventing infection. Right now in China, about 2% of the public has been infected by COVID-19 since the beginning of COVID-19, compared to 76% of us here in the United States. So we have more immunity than people in China, we have better vaccines with mRNA, and we have a higher vaccination rate, especially among the elderly population. Not for the general population, but for the elderly population in the United States we have a higher vaccination coverage. So when you put all of these together, in the United States we have about 73% of the public that is immune to Omicron, compared to 32% in China. So any outbreak in China, simply because there are about 70% of the public in China that are susceptible to Omicron, we expect a rapid surge of cases, similar to what we are seeing in Hong Kong and in other countries as well. Mobility is increasing, while mask wearing and testing decline More countries are relaxing their mandates right now \u2013 for example, New Zealand and Australia opened their borders to each other and travel is allowed right now. This could have an impact on reported cases as people are traveling and feel they are free to travel right now. Mask wearing is the lowest since we started reporting on mask wearing and since IHME started promoting mask wearing and providing scenarios showing how effective masks are in preventing mortality. So we're at less than 25% right now when it comes to mask wearing \u2013 it varies by countries, but mask wearing has dropped a lot because many countries relaxed their mask mandates, especially in Europe. Testing is declining in many countries: for example, in the UK, they're not paying anymore for testing, so we're seeing a decline in testing. That will impact our ability to track the pandemic in many countries and many locations. Some countries and states have decided to release data on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis, so the quality of data, the timeliness of data has changed, and that will impact our ability to track \u2013 not only us, but other groups who are doing similar projections \u2013 our ability to track the pandemic moving forward. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative Globally, there is a need to secure more antiviral medication and make sure it is available to every country to save lives and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals and protect the medical system. In countries where we see a surge of cases, recommending people to wear a mask and observe physical distance will be important. And in many countries in the world, it's very important to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, especially those who are not yet vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised and have health conditions. Our data right now show that a small percentage of people globally who want to get a vaccine or are willing to take the vaccine have not been able to receive the vaccine. The majority are in Africa. Therefore, it's very important to share vaccines with countries where people are willing to take the vaccine and they're waiting to get their vaccine. This is the only way for all of us to save lives and stop the spread of the virus, and of course we're not safe until all of us are safe. In the United States, the BA.2 variant is causing small rise in cases, but no surge expected In the US, we are seeing a slight rise in reported cases in some states, but we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in some European countries here in the US, simply because in the United States we have more immunity due to higher rates of previous infections in the country. BA.2 right now is the main circulating variant here in the United States \u2013 about 86% of the variants that are circulating in the US are BA.2. But because of previous infections in the US and our immunity, we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in Europe. The extension of the mask mandate on public transportation at the federal level and on airplanes will help a lot, especially right now with spring break vacations and people traveling. Many families are traveling for the first time with their children right now since the start of the pandemic, so one would expect, with the increased mobility and the fact that mask wearing is less than 25% in the US, that we'll see a slight increase in reported cases in the United States. We still believe that the pandemic phase of COVID-19 is over, simply because we have higher infections here in the United States and hence higher immunity. We are improving our vaccine and we soon should be able to have vaccines that are designed for the new variants; the vaccines that we have right now are highly effective, but we need to remember they were designed for the [ancestral] variant. And of course we have antiviral medications that will save lives and prevent hospitalization. If there is a surge from an escape variant, we can always go back to physical distancing and mask mandates and ask the public to wear a high-quality mask and avoid large gatherings. Recommendations for controlling the virus in the US The recommendations in the United States to contain the virus and the epidemic of this virus in the country remain the same: secure antiviral medications, distribute them, make sure patients can access them in a short time to save lives and prevent overwhelming our hospitals; maintain our surveillance system and also our genetic sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the US and, if there is a rise in cases, where it's happening and among whom, especially if they are vaccinated or not, so we can tell as soon as possible if the new variant is an escape variant and the vaccines are not as effective against it. For the public who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors, they need to remain more vigilant and wear a mask, especially if they are in close indoor settings with a large crowd. And all of us, if there is a surge and a new variant that is circulating, we also need to put our masks back on and make sure we maintain a physical and safe distance in order to reduce the chance of getting this virus. In the short term, the coming few months in the United States, IHME is projecting a decline after this tiny little surge, a decline of cases all the way until next winter, short of a new variant appearing. But we are projecting a decline in the number of cases all the way until next winter. April 8, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNew prediction for China: no major Omicron surge.

Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. Access to antivirals should be the primary focus of global efforts, shifting from previous emphasis on vaccination.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.2 is on the decline in Europe In this week's update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, first, the main findings that we see in the data and in our forecasts are that the BA.2 secondary surge of Omicron that has affected a number of countries in Europe appears to have peaked and is on the decline in almost all locations in Europe. Not all \u2013 there is some question about whether the United Kingdom has peaked and that the decline in cases may be due to access to testing since the tests now have to be paid for. But generally, we are seeing the peak and probably the decline of BA.2 in Europe. We do not expect a major BA.2 surge in the US In the United States, we have yet to see a BA.2 surge. There are some states where we're seeing hospitalization admissions go up slightly but not seeing the reported cases go up. So it may be that there's a small increase coming in some states. Our models for both Europe and the US do not suggest \u2013 at least for the US, we don't expect a major BA.2 surge, and in Europe we expect the surges to peak and decline. New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge The biggest factor in the analysis is the change in our results for China. We had been predicting for quite some time that Omicron would break out into the community and that China would choose to stop using a zero-Covid strategy, or what they call dynamic lockdown. But, given the rather stringent measures put in place in Shanghai, we don't expect, at least until the fall, that the Chinese government is going to step back from its zero-Covid strategy. We've used in the forecasts the observed reduction in mobility based on Baidu data for Shanghai and then assumed that whenever there is an outbreak in each province in China that there will be stringent measures put in place. So we've put substantial brakes on transmission that way through reduction in mobility in our modeling framework. This means that we don't predict a massive surge. We expect that will come later in the year. But we do see quite a number of deaths, given the quite low vaccination rates in the 80+ population in China that have become apparent. We must shift global focus from vaccination access to antivirals The expected trajectory in China does point to a very important role in the current Omicron wave, but more importantly for future new variants as they emerge, in access to antivirals. We see a lot of global discourse about access to vaccination, and that's certainly an important issue in terms of equity \u2013 everybody who wants a vaccine should be able to obtain a vaccine. But in terms of preventing death from future new variants, we think that the scale-up of antivirals, particularly the highly effective Paxlovid \u2013 but if other antivirals come along that are as effective, then those as well \u2013 is going to be the critical issue between a new variant, let's say that's more severe than Omicron, causing considerable mortality versus causing 80-90% less mortality. We will be producing, in the near future, antiviral scale-up scenarios to go alongside vaccination, booster, and mask use scenarios that we routinely produce as part of our periodic assessment of the pandemic. Those are the main findings. Likelihood of BA.2 surge depends on countries\u2019 levels of previous infection In other parts of the world, we're not seeing any evidence of a BA.2 secondary surge, even in places like South Africa where most of the transmission is currently BA.2. This difference across countries may well have to do with population-level immunity, how much prior infection, how much the first Omicron wave infected people. In places where there was a lot of transmission, there's probably enough immunity that we won't see much of a BA.2-related hump. Those are the main observations as we look around the world in our assessment of the pandemic. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling?

To reduce mortality rates, we recommend:\n\nPolicy recommendation: the US should begin planning for a winter surge including:\n\nSecuring antiviral medication Planning distribution of antivirals based on risk factors and age Anticipating the potential need for another vaccine dose\n\nthe US should begin planning for a winter surge including: Vaccine donations are still needed, but only if they have a long shelf life.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nCases are predicted to decline in the US The reported cases in our estimated infections are decreasing in the United States, and we project this trend will continue all the way to next winter. Our long-term projections for the United States show a rise in cases next winter but a small bump in some states, similar to what we are seeing right now in Europe. But in general in the US, we project a decline that will continue all the way until next winter. What we need to do in the United States is to remain vigilant, of course. COVID-19 is not over; the pandemic phase of it is over. We need to be very careful, especially those who have a risk factor or are immunocompromised. Fourth vaccine dose recommended for those aged 50+ The FDA has approved a fourth dose for people who are above 50. It\u2019s very important for all of us who are above 50, including myself, to go and get number four. It will help a lot in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, especially if you have received your second dose or your third dose more than five months ago. Why is Europe seeing a second wave, and will the same happen in the US? As far as what\u2019s happening in Europe, we know that the second wave in Europe after the peak of Omicron was due to BA.2 spreading, change of behavior, and waning immunity. In the United States, because we have higher infection compared to Europe \u2013 for example, compared to the UK \u2013 we have lower vaccination but more infections. With the combination of the two, we have more immunity in the United States, especially in the Southern states, where they had more infections than we\u2019ve seen in the UK. So we will not expect a big bump in the US. There may be a very minor one in some states, but a decline overall. What the US needs to do is to secure more antiviral medication and keep it and distribute it right now to places ahead of the next surge. And make sure we have a plan for distribution based on risk factors and the aging of the population in each location, but also to have a plan for redistribution in case we have a wave in one state and medication sitting in a warehouse in another state. So, shifting resources is very important for preparedness. We believe that before winter, because of waning immunity, another shot may be needed as well, depending on whether people have received four or three doses. Still, in the US, vaccination is not increasing, and unfortunately we have leveled at about 65% at the national level. Risk of cruises and other activities varies by personal factors CDC has announced that it's ok to get on a cruise ship. I believe it's safe, in my opinion, if you are vaccinated and boosted, and now if you are above 50 and getting the fourth dose. But of course, for all of us, whatever we do from now on has to be based on our own personal risk and the risk of people we live with or we are around. So basically, for somebody who\u2019s young and healthy, the risk is very minimal to get Omicron or BA.2, but for somebody who's older in age, has a risk factor, or is immunocompromised, the risk is much higher. Of course, we have to behave accordingly to protect ourselves and the people we live with and we care about. That's very important. The BA.2 wave is coming to an end in Europe As far as the global landscape, what we are seeing right now in Europe and many countries, the second peak has happened, and it's starting to come down \u2013 in the UK, for example. It\u2019s still going up in France as of today, coming down in the Netherlands, so in many European countries, that second peak lasted about 3-4 weeks and came down. This was driven mainly by BA.2 and the change of behavior. In Europe, they had more mandates than we did here in the United States, and then there was a sudden change of behavior, more so than in some states here in the United States where we didn't have any mandates, Florida for example. So basically, the behavioral change that has happened after the peak of Omicron is minimal in the United States compared to what we've seen in Europe. China continues to keep Omicron at bay China is the country that we are keeping an eye on right now. China so far has been able to contain the spread of Omicron in Beijing by lockdown and massive testing. Whether they will be able to do so and maintain that control in Shanghai and other large cities is a big question mark. BA.2 and Omicron are more infectious, so we believe the chances of containing the spread of Omicron in China will be very limited. Our long-term projections in China show that they will have a major surge coming up with a peak in May, towards the end of May, with a large number of hospitalizations and mortality, for several reasons. China has a high vaccination rate, but their vaccine is not as effective as the vaccines we are using here in the United States or in European countries. So what China needs to do is \u2013 and we know they have right now received the permit to produce mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, and they have their own mRNA vaccine being developed right now \u2013 so producing more vaccines and vaccinating people, especially the elderly in China, because we know there are reports that vaccination among the elderly is very low compared to what we have seen in other countries. Second, is to produce more antivirals, and we know that they have right now licenses to produce antiviral medication and distribute it in China. Preparing their hospitals for the surge is very important right now. Vaccine donations are still appreciated, but only if they have a long shelf life Vaccine donations have saved a lot of lives all over the world, and countries have been generous in providing extra doses of vaccines to others who need it. It's very important to remember as you donate these vaccines to make sure they have a long shelf life. They shouldn't be about to expire. Once you give a vaccine to a country, there are a lot of logistics and distributions and manpower that's needed to administer these vaccines. Indonesia, for example, has asked all donors, please when you give us a vaccine let's make sure it has a long shelf life. We need to keep that in mind and not waste vaccines. Thank you everybody for donating the vaccine, but let's make sure the vaccine can be used by the country that is receiving them in time before they expire.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nFour zones of Covid transmission in the world Majority of countries: transmission continues to decline Western Europe: secondary increase in transmission from BA.2 Southeast Asia: peak Omicron wave China: not yet experienced an Omicron wave, but we anticipate it will arrive in the next few months, causing up to a million deaths\n\nBA.2: Countries that have already dealt with BA.2 transmission (Netherlands, Denmark) saw brief surges that ended reasonably quickly. That pattern may spread to the rest of Western Europe and North America. Increased transmission is likely due to a combination of BA.2 and reduced mask use and social distancing.\n\nUkraine: there will likely be increased transmission due to the ongoing war and crowded conditions, but the impact may be reduced because of high levels of prior immunity in the population.\n\nPolicy recommendation: We should shift focus away from vaccination and towards production and distribution of anti-virals like Paxlovid. Can reduce death rate by 90% More likely to maintain effectiveness against new variants that may come in the future\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIn this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first thing to recognize is that there are really four zones of Covid transmission right now in the world. In the vast majority of countries, transmission continues to decline, as countries come off the peaks of Omicron transmission. Western Europe is experiencing a second wave in transmission from BA.2 As there has been quite a bit of media attention, there is a secondary increase in transmission in some countries in Western Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Greece, are places where transmission is on the increase. That increase is being attributed to the substitution of the BA.2 variant for the BA.1 variant, combined with reduced mask use and social distancing. We don't think it's just BA.2, because BA.2 has actually been around for quite some time. In fact, for example in South Africa, it appeared in December. It's replaced BA.1 but there's been no substantial increase in community level transmission. We don't think \u2013 and you see this in our forecasts \u2013 that this combination of BA.2 and reduced caution about transmission will lead to a prolonged secondary surge. The reason is the surge in the Netherlands \u2013 it went up, then came back up, and now the secondary surge has already peaked and is on its way down. In Denmark, the BA.1 and BA.2 parts sort of coalesced into one and that also came to an end reasonably quickly. We think that will be the pattern that we'll see in other countries in Western Europe, and it's possible that pattern will spread to the United States and Canada as well. Southeast Asia is in peak Omicron wave The third zone are those countries still in the main upswing, or peak levels of transmission due to a delayed Omicron wave. Those are mostly in Southeast Asia \u2013 Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples of that. And then the biggest driver of transmission, cases, and potentially deaths, is what's playing out in the zero-Covid strategy countries, so New Zealand looks to have hit their peak on Omicron, but it's coming down quite slowly. China has not yet seen an Omicron wave And then the big, big question is China. Because we've seen in an immunologically naive population with not good vaccination coverage in the elderly, quite a toll in Hong Kong. And now the question is when and if that will spread to mainland China. There are outbreaks in multiple cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other locations. The Chinese government is still pursuing the strategy of lockdown for a short period and then multiple rounds of mass testing to identify all cases and then quarantine them. This worked in Beijing in February to stop transmission and they are trying to pursue this for now, but the economic consequences are very great and there's greater calls within the Chinese leadership for less of a stringent policy. We predict next wave in China could be devastating Our model foresees that that can't go on for that long and so we have a huge peak, with perhaps as many as a million deaths in China coming through in April, May, and into June. The timing of that will depend critically on how the Chinese government chooses to either relax or not their zero-Covid strategy. The other key issue that could mitigate the huge death toll that could be coming in China is the recent announcement of an IP waiver from Pfizer for Paxlovid for producers in 22 countries, including five producers in China. So there's an interesting strategic choice that will play out, which is that the balance of the economic harm of the aggressive zero-Covid strategy and creating time to produce anti-virals that would be sufficient to protect some of the unvaccinated elderly within China. The timing and how that plays out is going to be up to the policy choices in China. The importance of anti-virals If we step back and zoom out more globally, there's still a tremendous amount of energy in trying to address vaccine inequality and addressing supply constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa around vaccination. That's certainly well-justified on moral grounds \u2013 everybody should have access to vaccination who wants it \u2013 but may not have a huge effect on death and hospitalization. We see in the data in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, that cumulative infection rates are quite high \u2013 80-90% of most countries have already been infected, they have immunity from infection, and also vaccine hesitancy is quite high. So even if the supply constraints are addressed \u2013 which they should be, on moral grounds \u2013 we should not expect that to make a huge effect on this 6-month timeframe of hospitalizations and death rates. However, what we don't see is similar international energy on the crucial issue of access to anti-virals, because anti-virals like Paxlovid can reduce the death rate by 90% and production capacity is small. With the new IP waivers going to India and China and some other countries, perhaps we can have a more concerted global effort in giving access to everybody who needs it, particularly the elderly, to anti-virals. That could really change the course of Covid over the next 12 months. The other aspect of the anti-virals scale-up that is important to recognize is that we don't really know if current vaccines will do much for future variants. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, particularly transmission, has been quite low with current vaccines. Whereas we suspect that the pathway that the anti-virals use will stay preserved and so the anti-virals will be an effective strategy irrespective of the type of variants that may come. So, as we step out and go into this phase where it's very unlikely that we'll see mandates and social distancing mandates as a main strategy for control. Then it's really down to vaccination and anti-virals. We've had lots of push on vaccination, and now we need equal policy attention and drive on the anti-virals. Covid in Ukraine Lastly, of course there is a real interest and attention on what might be the consequences on Covid of the war in Ukraine. Very difficult to assess, because of course the information systems have fallen apart amid the setting of the incredible destruction and invasion that is underway. But, one aspect of it that may mean the effect of millions of refugees crowding, lack of opportunities to social distance, may not be as bad as it might have been, is that despite low vaccination rates in the Ukraine, they have very high levels of prior infection, so there is quite a substantial amount of immunity. Of course, there will be increased transmission. We probably won't get any data about it, but hopefully the impact will be much less than if they had been a truly immunologically naive population.\n\nMarch 4, 2022 - COVID-19 impact on women's equality\n\nPresented by Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women in terms of employment & income loss, gender-based violence, and returning to school.\n\nPolicy action : Governments should incentivize girls going back to school and prioritize the areas of life most affected in their region.\n\nRead the research article.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIt's really important, as we move past the latest wave of Omicron deaths and infections, to pay a lot of attention to the other areas of life and society that the pandemic has had a big pull on. In our study, we measured the impacts of the pandemic on some of these areas, particularly on employment and education, on income loss, on foregoing utilizing other health care for one\u2019s needs, and particularly how those may have disproportionately affected women compared to men around the world.\n\nAs the world moves on to the next phase, it is really important to consider all other aspects of life that the pandemic has had a big impact on, not only the direct effects on deaths and infections that we have been living with over the past two years.\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women when it comes to employment loss, to income loss, to increased perceptions of gender-based violence, and also with regard to education and who is returning to school compared to who is dropping out of school.\n\nRead \u00bbCOVID-19 Led to Worse Social and Economic Consequences for Women published in Think Global Health\n\nEven though there are a lot of areas that the pandemic has affected, our findings only scratch the surface of what the real impact of the pandemic may have been, as we have only been able to explore a few of these areas. But we think that the impact of the pandemic has been broad and is going to be felt for years to come.\n\nIt has been widely discussed that the effect of the pandemic on schools and on education is very profound. Sadly, we have very little data to measure what is happening right now to the millions of learners around the world, but from what we know, we are quite concerned that as societies and schools go back to normal, girls will be returning to education at a lower rate compared to boys. This happened after previous crises, and there are some indications that it is happening again as a result of COVID school closures. It is really important that societies and governments prioritize incentivizing girls going back to school and returning to education now that schools are reopening again.\n\nOur study is the first study that has taken a comprehensive lens to the impact of the pandemic on gender disparities. While we have not answered all the questions, we\u2019re hoping that policymakers will look at the most important areas of society and life that have been affected by COVID with respect to gender disparities in their own country, and prioritize what they should be addressing first. In some regions of the world, the most severe impact has been felt on employment loss; in other regions of the world, education should be prioritized. We\u2019re hoping that our study will contribute information needed as we move to the next phase of life and COVID-19, to prioritize the areas where the gender gaps are most pronounced and most severe.\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCOVID anomalies: Cases on the rise: Russian Federation and Belarus Cases declining faster than expected: the Caribbean and South America Cases increasing again after a decline: Finland, Sardinia, Canada (Manitoba province)\n\nChina: Omicron wave has not yet hit, but we expect that will change by March or April.\n\nFunctional immunity: We\u2019re updating the model to reflect patterns in immunity from vaccination, previous infection from Omicron, or previous infection from other variants.\n\nUnited States: About \u00be of the population is currently immune to Omicron.\n\nWhat does the future hold? We expect there to be intensified transmission next winter and more variants will likely emerge.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nWhere cases have continued to rise This week\u2019s update from IHME on modeling and analyzing the COVID epidemic: First, in terms of what\u2019s happened around the world that is not following the trajectory that we expected, the only major observation on that front is that the increase in cases in the Russian Federation and perhaps Belarus has continued to rise. We expected because we\u2019ve estimated past infection levels to be very high, they should have run out of people to infect, but they\u2019ve kept going. So we expect that peak should come soon, but of course the fact that it has kept going may imply that levels of past infection have not been as high as we\u2019ve previously expected. Where cases are declining faster than expected The second observation is that the Omicron wave is going down faster in some regions than we expected, or somewhat faster. The Caribbean stands out \u2013 actually South America in general stands out \u2013 in declining faster than perhaps we expected. Where cases are increasing again after a decline There are a handful of anomalies that we are observing around countries where after a decline, cases have gone back up. Finland is included in that, Sardinia would be in that group, Manitoba province in Canada. In each of these, we\u2019re not sure what the explanation is \u2013 could be a local phenomenon around increased transmission or spatial spread. In the case of Finland, it may be the same thing that happened in Denmark \u2013 the spread of the BA.2 variant. But certainly, these are not happening in a large number of locations and seem to be specific to those particular places. The situation in China Our global numbers do look different because of China, where we expected that by now the Omicron epidemic would have taken hold more broadly in the community and we would be seeing widespread transmission. The public health authorities in China, through vigorous lockdowns, have been able to stop transmission in Beijing. We are therefore pushing out later into March and April what we continue to expect will happen \u2013 which is that there will be a widespread Omicron wave. At the global level, that makes a difference. How we\u2019re factoring in functional immunity The last thing to note is that as part of our analyses, we are going to be including what\u2019s in the models for quite some time: the fraction of people in each population that have got functional immunity to Omicron. That immunity comes from vaccination, even though vaccines are only partially effective for blocking Omicron infection; it comes from past infection with other variants; and it comes from infection with Omicron. In each case, we compute that functional immunity, taking into account the pattern of waning for vaccination and for natural infection, and the cross-variant immunity, or the breakthrough that Omicron has against prior variant infection. When you put all that together, in a place like for example the United States, we see about three-fourths of the population currently are immune to Omicron. We expect that number will continue to grow as we go through this tail-end of the Omicron wave in the United States. Does that mean that so many people are immune to Omicron that we will see no further transmission or waves of COVID in the future? The answer is no, because we will have \u2013 if no new variant emerges \u2013 we would expect Omicron to return next winter. There will be more waning of immunity, more people will have gone back to being susceptible, and we\u2019d be back into winter intensified transmission. Of course, we do think variants will emerge, and so further increases or outbreaks are likely as the new variants emerge that have immune escape and can infect people who are currently immune to Omicron. We don\u2019t expect those new variants, however, to have the same consequence that the Delta variant had last year. Because global levels of immunity are going to be much higher and there\u2019s the advent of access, which we hope will eventually be global, to antivirals, which will substantially reduce the infection-fatality rate. Those are the main insights from this week\u2019s analysis. February 10, 2022 - Q&A with Dr. Murray\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nIncorporating incidental COVID deaths into the model is still a work in progress : We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track.\n\n: We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track.

It will be difficult for zero-COVID countries, like China, to keep Omicron at bay. The new variant is so transmissible that even lockdowns will not hold it off for long.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nHow will your model account for incidental COVID deaths? We know from a variety of community-level studies \u2013 hospital pre-admission screenings, some cohort studies in India, the ONS [UK Office for National Statistics] infection survey \u2013 that Omicron comes with a very high prevalence in the community, as high as 10% or 12% of the population shedding virus at any one time. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the incidental hospital admissions and deaths. The challenge as we dig into this is jurisdiction. By jurisdiction, the way incidental admissions and deaths are being counted appears to be different. And so, at present, we're not able to understand this difference for every jurisdiction. We are starting to compile the data as provided, or the guidance as provided, by each jurisdiction, but since we track nearly 400 different jurisdictions, counting the subnational units in many countries, it's going to be quite a task for us to fully understand this. But it's a work in progress. How has IHME\u2019s approach to COVID-19 forecasting changed? The IHME approach to modeling the epidemic has kept progressing as the epidemic unfolded. Our very first model in March of 2020 was really driven by the experience observed in Wuhan and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions there on transmission. We then transitioned to a transmission dynamics model with other drivers, mask use, mobility, testing, and a bunch of contextual factors such as smoking, air pollution, and altitude, population density, and a variety of other factors. And then we had to modify the model to take into account vaccination, and then the spread of variants with the emergence of the Alpha variant. And then finally, the big change that's come in the last few months has been taking into account waning of infection-acquired immunity and waning of vaccine-acquired immunity. We're trying to keep abreast of what the virus is showing us and the complexity of what's happening around the world. I think part of the reason that our out-of-sample predictability or model performance has continued to be quite good is because we are trying to essentially keep up with the virus while we learn about it. What will be the consequences of removing mask mandates? Right now, in countries where Omicron is subsiding, there's a pretty rapid move to lift mandates. We're seeing it in some US states, Canadian provinces, many countries in Europe, and discussion elsewhere of similar moves. I think removing the mandates makes sense in settings where we think that most people who are susceptible to Omicron have been infected and the numbers are coming down because we've run out of people to infect. In those settings, the mandates aren't really achieving much at all. And so there should be little to no risk in removing those mandates. In settings, which we don't see a lot of, where there is a lot of behavioral modification, people are avoiding contact, mobility has come way down, and mask use has gone up, then perhaps some of the peaks in Omicron may have been before all the people who are susceptible have been infected \u2013 and then you might get a secondary resurgence if you take the mandates off. But there are not many places where the other data on mobility and mask use would suggest that that's really the driver of the peak, in which case we think removing the mandates will have little to no impact on transmission once you're on the downswing of Omicron. Should China relax its restrictions, and what will happen if it does? The big question with Omicron is what do zero-COVID countries, most importantly China, do? And it's really quite a challenge because we worry most about people who are unvaccinated and never infected, so essentially there's almost nobody in China who's been infected, except a very small percentage of the population from the original outbreak. And you have quite high vaccination rates, but the vaccine isn't particularly effective against Omicron. It's much worse efficacy than say Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca. The challenge that the Chinese government has is how to manage this situation. If there's a strategy ahead where they can deliver a more effective vaccine booster to the over-65s and under-65s with comorbidities \u2013 the vulnerable group \u2013 or they can gain access to intellectual property around antivirals and start producing enough antivirals to start producing a big caseload, then that becomes a way out. You keep up with the rolling lockdowns in each place where an Omicron outbreak occurs until you're ready with those other strategies. But if there isn't going to be that strategy, then continuous rolling lockdown \u2013 because we expect Omicron will just keep reemerging because it's so infectious \u2013 probably becomes infeasible. Right now, that choice on strategy is probably what the Chinese leadership is trying to figure out. We don't think it's feasible to keep Omicron out of the community for very l"

        "text": "With Monkeypox, COVID-19, and subsequent Long COVID symptoms in addition to persistent diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, the world is dealing with a lot right now. Luckily, the pharmaceutical world has clinical trials underway to address all of them.\n\nSIGA Technologies' product TPOXX (tecovirimat), an antiviral approved in the U.S. for smallpox, is being used under certain conditions for monkeypox, but only under \u201ccompassionate use\u201d in the U.S. The NIH is now involved in developing a U.S.-based randomized clinical trial to evaluate the drug for the treatment of monkeypox disease, which will be conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.\n\nSyneuRx International announced results from its Phase II trial of SNB01 (pentarlandir), a novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate. The trial evaluated 89 patients who had breakthrough or unvaccinated cases of COVID-19 and were given high-dose, low-dose or placebo. Pantarlandir decreased the inflammation caused by the disease and improved overall health. Pantarlandir blocks coronavirus replication.\n\nAstraZeneca and HUTCHMED Tout 49% ORR in NSCLC\n\nThis weekend, AstraZeneca and partner HUTCHMED presented positive Phase II data for a combination of Tagrisso (osimertinib) plus savolitinib. The latter is an oral, potent and highly selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) being co-developed by the two companies. Tagrisso is AstraZeneca's irreversible EGFR-TKI, which has a proven impact on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nIn the Phase II SAVANNAH trial, the combination led to an objective response rate (ORR) of 49% in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC with high levels of MET overexpression and/or amplification.\n\nNotably, the highest response rate (52%) was achieved in patients who had not been treated with prior chemotherapy. The results appeared to be highly dependent upon Savolitinib's mechanism of action as patients whose tumors did not show high levels of MET had an ORR of just 9%.\n\nThe results were presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's 2022 World Conference on Lung Cancer in Vienna, Austria.\n\nCymaBay Therapeutics completed enrollment for its Phase III RESPONSE study of seladelpar for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug for patients with PBC who have been using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA or ursodial) but have not achieved the recommended treatment goal, or who can\u2019t tolerate UDCA. Seladelpar is a first-in-class oral, selective PPAR delta agonist.\n\nEliem Therapeutics reported results from its Phase IIa trial of ETX-810 for lumbosacral radicular pain (LSRP). ETX-810 is a new entity prodrug of the bioactive lipid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). It is also being evaluated in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). The study did not achieve statistically signification separation from placebo on the study\u2019s primary endpoint, which was changed from baseline to week 4 in the weekly average of the daily pain score measured with the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS). This was consistent with the Phase IIa study of the drug in DPNP. As a result, they are discontinuing the development of the drug.\n\nImmutep presented new data from its Phase II TACTI-002 trial of eftilagimod alpha for first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study hit the primary objective, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 38.6% to the combination of the drug with Merck\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and favorable anti-tumor activity. There were also improved secondary endpoints, including Disease Control Rate (DCR) and interim median Progression Free Survival (PFS), across all PD-L1 expression levels. The drug is a soluble LAG-3 fusion protein.\n\nOrca Bio announced its Phase III Precision-T trial is open, enrolling and treating patients. It expects to enroll about 174 patients at more than 20 transplant centers across the U.S. It is studying the safety and efficacy of Orca-T compared to standard-of-care allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Orca-T is an investigational high-precision cell therapy made up of infusions containing regulatory T-cells, conventional T-cells and CD34+ stem cells derived from peripheral blood from either related or unrelated matched donors.\n\nHalozyme Therapeutics announced Roche\u2019s Phase III IMscin001 trial of a subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) with Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE technology met its co-primary endpoints. The study demonstrated non-inferior levels of Tecentriq in the blood when injected SC compared with IV infusion in cancer immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC where previous platinum therapy failed.\n\nLandos Biopharma announced positive topline data from its Phase Ib trial of NX-13 for ulcerative colitis. The drug is a novel, oral, NLRX1 agonist, dosed once a day for four weeks. The drug was well tolerated. The company plans to initiate a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing.\n\nAthira Pharma presented the first results from its Phase II proof-of-concept trial of fosgonimeton in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s. The drug is a small-molecule positive modulator of the HGF/MET neurotrophic factor system. The primary outcome analysis (mITT, MMRM) did not meet statistical significance. However, the company indicates the data gave meaningful insights into the drug\u2019s potential effects, including showing its potential activity, which included a decrease in plasma levels of the fluid biomarker, NfL.\n\nNovavax initiated a Phase IIb/III Hummingbird trial to evaluate two doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in younger children ages 6 months through 11 years, followed by a booster at 6 months after the primary vaccination series. The study is expected to enroll 3,600 children in the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, UK, South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil."

        "text": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reported a 44% drop in revenue for the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nThis overall drop was associated with sales of REGEN-COV, its antibody cocktail against COVID-19, banned in the U.S. in January, with a few exceptions, because it was ineffective against the Omicron variants. Otherwise, company sales were up 20%.\n\nThe real positive drivers were Eylea for chronic eye diseases and Dupixent for inflammatory conditions. Eylea climbed 14% to $1.62 billion. Since 2021, it has brought in $5.79 billion, an increase of 17% from the previous year.\n\nIn a note to investors, Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal wrote, \u201cWe see 2Q22 results as representing a strong beat, with Eylea results showing a strong front against competition from [Roche\u2019s] Vabysmo and continued momentum from Dupixent.\"\n\nDupixent sales jumped almost 40% to $2.09 billion for the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe second quarter of 2022 was distinguished by record net product sales of Eylea, Dupixent, and Libtayo, as well as multiple regulatory achievements for Dupixent, including U.S. approvals for atopic dermatitis among very young patients and for eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, as well as European approval for pediatric asthma,\u201d Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., president and CEO of Regeneron, said. \u201cIn addition, we have continued to strengthen our oncology franchise, including through the purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo as well as encouraging but preliminary anti-tumor activity observed at higher doses of our novel PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo for advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs is common with quarterly reports, Regeneron updated its pipeline, including terminating four clinical trials of REGEN-COV. The axed trials include a study of the antibody cocktail in high-risk patients 12 years and younger, a prevention trial in immunocompromised teens and adults, and a study in children hospitalized with COVID-19 and one for non-hospitalized patients. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the studies were terminated because of \u201cemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants impacting susceptibility to study drug.\u201d\n\nRegeneron\u2019s antibody therapy against COVID-19 wasn\u2019t the only such treatment to lose the battle against variants and antiviral drugs. GlaxoSmithKline-Vir Biotechnology\u2019s sotrovimab, as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s bamlanivamab and etesevimab have shown less effectiveness against variants, resulting in modifications to their Emergency Use Authorizations and sales. Largely, they have been replaced by effective vaccines, such as Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid and Merck\u2019s Lagevrio.\n\nRegeneron has about 35 drugs in clinical development.\n\nThe company\u2019s collaboration revenue with Sanofi increased by 55% to $678 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2021. Although they have pulled back on this somewhat in recent years, Regeneron has long been dubbed Sanofi\u2019s \u201cinnovation engine.\u201d The increase in revenue was related to shared profits from the commercialization of antibodies and higher Dupixent profits.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s R&D investments were $794 million for the quarter, and Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) were $475 million. The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%, compared to 17.4% in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the proportion of income earned in foreign sales with lower tax rates than in the U.S.\n\nGAAP net income per diluted share was $7.47 in the quarter, compared to $27.97 in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with our second quarter 2022 financial performance, including 20% revenue growth when excluding contributions from REGEN-COV. This demonstrates the continued strength of our core business,\u201d Robert E. Landry, executive vice president, Finance, and CFO of Regeneron, said. \u201cAdditionally, we updated our full-year 2022 financial guidance primarily to reflect the recently completed acquisition of Libtayo global rights from Sanofi, a transaction that we believe will deliver significant shareholder value over time. In the second half of 2022, we look forward to advancing our pipeline with important clinical data readouts in oncology and ophthalmology as well as continued commercial execution and prudent capital allocation to drive value creation for shareholders.\u201d"

        "link": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a40810254/galaxy-cluster-radio-waves/",
        "text": "A faraway galaxy cluster boasts an unusual backward shockwave phenomenon.\n\nGalaxy clusters contain up to thousands of galaxies and tons of plasma in motion.\n\nThe backward shockwave may be from overlapping collisions among subclusters.\n\nScientists from the University of Western Australia and Italy\u2019s Universit\u00e0 di Bologna have been studying an extremely faraway galaxy cluster, Abell 3266, where they\u2019ve identified three phenomena that are unheard of elsewhere\u2014at least so far. And all three emit radio waves that have allowed us to observe them across a distance so far it almost defies units of measure altogether.\n\nAbell 3266 is a galaxy cluster that\u2019s 809 million light years away from Earth in an area known as the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster. (As you zoom out further and further into space, you see that we, in the Milky Way, are part of a supercluster as well. Some supercluster-like structures we believe to exist are so large they potentially unmake our existing theory of the universe itself!)\n\nIn a piece for the Conversation , a website that publishes content from academics, the scientists explain that the term \u201cgalaxy cluster\u201d is a little bit misleading. Yes, a cluster may contain \u201chundreds, or even thousands\u201d of galaxies, they say, but the overwhelming majority of mass in these clusters is dark matter, with \u201chot plasma \u2018soup\u2019\u201d making up the rest. The Milky Way is made up of an estimated 85 percent dark matter , for example. Galaxies, themselves, make up a measly \u201cfew percent.\u201d\n\nOn Earth, we primarily understand plasma as the makeup of stars, including our sun. But plasma physics is a huge field, since plasma itself is just another state of matter. The more we can examine it in different contexts, the more we can understand\u2014knowledge that may also eventually help people on Earth who work on projects like nuclear fusion energy.\n\nAbell 3266 is \u201ca particularly dynamic\u201d cluster, named for prolific astronomer and public scientist George O. Abell, who surveyed both the northern and southern skies for galaxy clusters during his lifetime. (Abell 3266 is in the southern sky.) While observing the cluster with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes, the researchers observed three different unusual phenomena: radio relics, radio haloes, and fossil radio sources.\n\nAll three of these phenomena are created by energy slamming into abundant plasma. With radio relics, this reaction sends out shockwaves like the sonic booms we experience on Earth. They themselves aren\u2019t unusual in galaxy clusters, but the one these researchers found is backward. The brightness in this area of the cluster suggests that a shockwave should travel from north to south, but instead it goes from south to north. The researchers dubbed this a \u201cwrong-way\u201d radio relic.\n\nRadio-on-optical overlay of the \u2018wrong-way\u2019 relic to the SE of Abell 3266. Risely et. al\n\nThe researchers say other scientists have begun to observe other backward radio relics in similar work, showing that this is an uncommon, but not nonexistent, phenomenon. And they theorize that the wrong-way radio relics result from not just energy striking plasma, but multiple subclusters striking each other simultaneously. Think about biting down on a crunchy potato chip versus biting down on a crunchy potato chip that was folded over during manufacturing.\n\nIn their paper, published August 1 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers present all three radio anomalies with the follow-up note that they all require a lot more study; this paper is kind of an announcement, rather than a conclusion. \u201c[F]urther work is required to fully unpack the history of Abell 3266 and its constituent radio galaxies, and the answers to a number of questions remain elusive,\u201d they conclude.\n\nCaroline Delbert Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

        "text": "Using information from ESA\u2019s Swarm satellite mission, scientists have discovered a completely new type of magnetic wave that sweeps across the outermost part of Earth\u2019s outer core every seven years and propagates westward at up to 1 500 km (932 miles) a year. The discovery offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth\u2019s core.\n\nSince the trio of Swarm satellites was launched in 2013, scientists have been analyzing their data to gain new insight into many of Earth\u2019s natural processes, from space weather to the physics and dynamics of Earth\u2019s stormy heart.\n\nMeasuring our magnetic field from space is the only real way of probing deep down to Earth\u2019s core. Seismology and mineral physics provide information about the material properties of the core, but they do not shed any light on the dynamo-generating motion of the liquid outer core.\n\nBut now, using data from the Swarm mission, scientists have unearthed a hidden secret.\n\n\u201cGeophysicists have long theorized over the existence of such waves, but they were thought to take place over much longer time scales than our research has shown,\u201d said lead author Nicolas Gillet from the University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes.\n\n\u201cMeasurements of the magnetic field from instruments based on the surface of Earth suggested that there was some kind of wave action, but we needed the global coverage offered by measurements from space to reveal what is actually going on.\n\n\u201cWe combined satellite measurements from Swarm, and also from the earlier German Champ mission and Danish \u00d8rsted mission, with a computer model of the geodynamo to explain what the ground-based data had thrown up \u2013 and this led to our discovery.\u201d\n\nOwing to Earth\u2019s rotation, these waves align in columns along the axis of rotation. The motion and magnetic field changes associated with these waves are strongest near the equatorial region of the core.\n\nWhile the research exhibits magneto-Coriolis waves near a seven-year period, the question of the existence of such waves that would oscillate at different periods, however, remains.\n\n\u201cMagnetic waves are likely to be triggered by disturbances deep within the Earth\u2019s fluid core, possibly related to buoyancy plumes. Each wave is specified by its period and typical length-scale, and the period depends on characteristics of the forces at play. For magneto-Coriolis waves, the period is indicative of the intensity of the magnetic field within the core,\u201d Gillet added.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that other such waves are likely to exist, probably with longer periods \u2013 but their discovery relies on more research.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earth\u2019s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earth\u2019s thermal history,\u201d said Ilias Daras, ESA\u2019s Swarm mission scientist.\n\nReferences:\n\n1 Swarm unveils magnetic waves deep down \u2013 ESA \u2013 May 23, 2022\n\n2 Satellite magnetic data reveal interannual waves in Earth\u2019s core \u2013 Nicolas Gillet et al. \u2013 PNAS \u2013 March 21, 2022 \u2013 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.211525811\n\nFeatured image credit: University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, ESA"

        "title": "Does Delta 8 Show up on a Drug Test?",
        "link": "https://discovermagazine.com/lifestyle/does-delta-8-show-up-on-a-drug-test",
        "text": "Sign up for our email newsletter for the latest science news\n\nThis article contains affiliate links to products. We may receive a commission for purchases made through these links.\n\nIf you are worried about whether Delta 8 will show up on a drug test, it's important to know that there are some tests that can detect Delta 8, so bear it in mind before taking any kind of medication or recreational drugs.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the various types of drug tests and how Delta 8 might show up on them. We will also provide information on how to clear your system if you are concerned about passing a drug screening.\n\nBest Delta 8 Gummies\n\nEverest Delta 8 Gummies Effex\u2019s Delta 8 THC Gummies Chill Plus Delta-8 Squares Gummies \u2013 1000x 3Chi\u2019s Delta 8 Gummies Moonwlkr\u2019s D-8 THC Gummies\n\nFirst, there are many different types of drug tests. The most common is a urine test, but there are also blood tests, hair follicle tests, and saliva tests. Delta 8 THC can technically show up on all of these types of tests, but it's much more likely to show up on a urine test.\n\nThe reason for this is that Delta 8 THC is metabolized differently than other types of THC. When you consume Delta 8, it's broken down into different metabolites in your body. One of those metabolites is called THCCOOH, which is the metabolite that urine tests are designed to detect.\n\nIf you're concerned about passing a drug test, your best bet is to avoid consuming any products that have any level of THC in them.\n\nWhat is Delta 8?\n\nDelta 8 is a cannabinoid that is similar to THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. However, Delta 8 has different effects on the body and mind than THC does. For example, Delta 8 is known to cause less anxiety and paranoia than THC does.\n\nWhy do some people need to pass drug tests?\n\nThere are many reasons why people may need to pass a drug test. Some people are required to take drug tests for their job, especially if they work in safety-sensitive positions. Others may be required to take drug tests as part of a court order or probation agreement.\n\nWhat are Delta 8 gummies?\n\nDelta 8 gummies are a type of cannabis edible that contains Delta-THC. These gummies are becoming increasingly popular as a way to consume Delta-THC, as they offer a convenient and discrete way to enjoy the effects of this cannabinoid.\n\nDoes Delta-8 show up in urine?\n\nBecause delta-8 can be found in urine, it will show up on a urine drug test. While there is a legal loophole around the usage of delta-8, it will not help you pass a drug test. If you're going to be tested soon, avoid using delta 8 products.\n\nWhen it comes to blood tests, delta 8 is not as easily detected. Delta 8 can only be found in the blood for a few hours after use. If you're going to be tested within 24 hours of using delta-eight, there's a chance it may show up in your blood test. However, this is unlikely.\n\nIf you're worried about failing a drug test, avoid using delta-8 products. There are other CBD products that won't put you at risk of failing a drug test. Delta 8 is a new and popular cannabinoid, but it's not worth risking your job over. Be safe and consume CBD in a way that won't jeopardize your livelihood.\n\nHow long do you need to be clean to pass a urine drug test?\n\nIt is typically recommended that you abstain from all cannabis use for at least 30 days before taking a urine drug test. However, it is important to note that Delta 8 can be detected in your system for up to 90 days. This means that if you are taking a urine drug test within 90 days of consuming Delta 8 THC, it is likely that the test will come back positive.\n\nWhat are the risks of taking Delta 8?\n\nDelta 8 is a relatively new cannabinoid, and as such, not much is known about its long-term effects on the human body. However, some short-term side effects of Delta 8 include anxiety, paranoia, and dizziness. It is important to note that Delta 8 can also interact with other medications you may be taking.\n\nWhat's the difference between Delta 8 and Delta 9?\n\nDelta 8 and delta 9 are variants of the same THC compound. What exactly does that imply? It means they have similar chemical structures, which is why they have comparable effects on the body.\n\nDelta 8 is less powerful than cannabis, therefore you'll feel less intense effects. As a result, delta 8 makes you feel high but at a lower intensity than marijuana. It might also have comparable medicinal advantages, although not to the same extent as cannabis.\n\nThe chemical structure of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol is different from that of cannabidiol. Delta 9's instability is due to the fact that it contains a different type of THC chemical structure.\n\nTHC is more unstable when it's being destroyed by an acid. This can lead to a stronger product since THC is less stable, making it more potent and likely to cause a response in the body. It may also explain why the endocannabinoid system processes these THC molecules in two very distinct ways.\n\nWhat is the endocannabinoid system?\n\nThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a biological system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the vertebrate central nervous system (including the brain)\n\nThe two main types of cannabinoids are: THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). Most people are familiar with THC, which is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. CBD, on the other hand, is not psychoactive and does not produce a \"high.\"\n\nThe endocannabinoid system plays a role in many physiological processes, including pain, appetite, memory, and mood. It is also involved in mediating the psychoactive effects of THC.\n\nThe endocannabinoid system is thought to be involved in a variety of medical conditions, including pain, inflammation, anxiety, depression, cancer, and addiction.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Delta 8 Gummies\n\nThere are some criteria to consider before buying one of the 5 best delta 8 gummies we've featured below:\n\nIngredients\n\nMake sure to check the list of ingredients to ensure that the product does not contain any harmful chemicals or additives.\n\nTHC Content\n\nThe THC content should be less than 0.03% to be considered legal in most states.\n\nPrice\n\nDelta-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) gummies can range in price from $15 to $50.\n\nFlavor\n\nDelta-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) gummies are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, and grape.\n\nThird Party Testing\n\nIt's important to make sure that the product has been third-party tested for quality and purity.\n\nReviews\n\nBe sure to read reviews from other customers before purchasing a product. This will give you an idea of the quality of the product and if it is worth the price.\n\nNow that you know more about delta 8, let\u2019s elaborate more on the 5 best delta 8 gummies to buy today:\n\nImage courtesy Everest\n\nThe Everest Delta 8 THC business produces the Everest Delta-8 Gummies, one of the most well-known edibles on the market. These products are ideal for everyone, but especially those who follow a vegan diet since they are 100 percent vegan.\n\nThe Everest Delta-8 Gummies are composed of organically grown cannabis, another reason for their popularity. The marijuana is subjected to the most stringent organic farming regulations from growing to harvesting.\n\nGiven this, you can rest confident in the quality of this product when it comes to protecting you from hazardous chemicals. All things considered, perhaps the most significant aspect is that these treats have been tested and passed third-party inspections.\n\nBefore and after the production process, the Everest Delta-8 gummies are subjected to third-party GMP testing. The goal is to verify the strength, quality, and safety of everything that enters into producing these edibles.\n\n2. Effex\u2019s Delta 8 THC Gummies\n\nImage courtesy Effex\n\nEffex's Delta-THC Gummies are a fantastic way to consume delta 8, especially if you're new to the world of edibles.

We understand how you feel. Many individuals are concerned about the prospect of missing a key job, health checkup, or legal requirement due to their usage.\n\nFortunately, there are many hemp-based products that do not contain THC. Most brands we've featured also have a selection of THC-free, broad-spectrum hemp goods available!\n\nSome people choose to use CBD oil in place of Delta 8 Gummies. This is an excellent option because CBD oil does not contain THC and has a number of health benefits. CBD oil can be found in most health food stores and online.\n\nWhat are other methods to get Delta 8?\n\nThere are a few other ways to get your hands on delta 8. You can buy it online as a standalone product or as an additive to other products like CBD oil. Hemp flower that has been specifically bred to contain high levels of delta 8 is also available from some retailers.\n\nBut no matter how you choose to get delta 8, it\u2019s important to remember that this cannabinoid is federally illegal and is only legal in some (but not all) states. Like other supplements, it\u2019s not regulated by the FDA and there is no quality control in place to ensure that products labeled as containing delta 8 actually do contain it. So, be sure to do your research before buying any delta 8 products.\n\nWhat do urine drug tests pick up?\n\nUrine drug tests usually pick up THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. However, they may also pick up other cannabinoids like CBD and Delta-THC (THC\u2019s metabolite).\n\nIt is generally recommended that you abstain from cannabis for at least two weeks before taking a urine drug test. This will ensure that Delta 8 THC is not detected in your urine.\n\nWill Delta 8 Gummies Show on Drug Test?\n\nYes, delta 8 contains the metabolite that drug tests are designed to look for, so you will more than likely fail a drug test when taking it for work, court orders, or whatever other reason you've been told that you must pass a regular drug test.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you're looking for an edible that is both potent and delicious, there are plenty of options to choose from. Just be sure to check the lab results to ensure quality and potency. And always start with a low dose to see how your body reacts.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that these products do contain THC so if you\u2019re sensitive to them or worried about failing a drug test, then you will want to be careful about trying these gummies for relaxation too closely to a drug test."

        "text": "The prehistoric roots of the cold sore herpes virus\n\nHuman herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the common causes of lip- and coldsores and is estimated to infect 3.7 billion people under the age of 50. Now, recently ancient genomes suggest that the herpes virus strain behind facial herpes arose around five thousand years ago.\n\nPreviously, genetic data for herpes only went back to 1925, but researchers were able to extract samples from the remains of four ancient individuals stretching over a thousand-year period \u2013 the oldest of which dated back to the late Iron Age around 1,500 years ago.\n\nOne of the samples of ancient herpes DNA used in the study came from a male of 26-35 years old, excavated near the banks of the Rhine. The man was a fervent smoker of clay pipes. Traces of the habit are visible in multiple places on the teeth, where the hard clay pipe, usually put in the same place in the mouth, has worn the teeth. Credit: Dr Barbara Veselka\n\n\u201cBy comparing ancient DNA with herpes samples from the 20th century, we were able to analyse the differences and estimate a mutation rate, and consequently a timeline for virus evolution,\u201d explains co-lead author Dr Lucy van Dorp, from the Genetics Institute at the University College London in the UK.\n\nThis calculation led to the estimate that 5,000 years ago something happened that allowed one strain of herpes to overtake all others. The authors of the new study, published in Science Advances, suggest it may have coincided with the arrival of a new cultural practice introduced from the east: romantic and sexual kissing.\n\nStickers that can see inside the body\n\nEngineers have designed a stamp-sized device that sticks to skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours \u2013 according to a new study published in Science.\n\nThe ultrasound sticker produces high resolution images by pairing a stretchy adhesive layer with a rigid array of transducers. The adhesive layer is made from two thin layers of elastomer encapsulating a middle layer of solid hydrogel. Ultrasound transducers convert electrical energy into sound energy and back again, to produce and detect sound waves.\n\n\u201cThis combination enables the device to conform to the skin while maintaining the relative location of transducers to generate clearer and more precise images,\u201d says co-lead author Chonghe Wang, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US.\n\nThe current design requires the stickers be connected to instruments that translate the reflected sound waves into images, but the team is working toward wireless devices that could be wearable imaging products for patients.\n\nMIT engineers designed an adhesive patch that produces ultrasound images of the body. The stamp-sized device sticks to skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours.

But accurately simulating liquid flow remains one of the most computationally challenging aspects of modelling the real world, because it involves precisely calculating complex and time-varying pressure distributions within the liquid.\n\nNow, researchers have made a significant breakthrough in computational speed for modelling viscous liquids, by combining efficient mathematics with the low-level parallel computational capabilities of modern computer processors, according to a new study in ACM Transactions on Graphics.\n\n\u201cIn this research, we propose the Unsmoothed Aggregation Algebraic Multigrid method as a sophisticated multigrid framework that fully utilises modern CPU features and introduces new numerical methods,\u201d explains co-author Han Shao, a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cOur framework can be used immediately by industrial users for faster simulation, using the code available on our project website.\u201d\n\nA state-of-the-art method for modeling the behavior of liquids described by KAUST researchers represents a breakthrough in computational speed for viscous liquids.

Similar versions of the lures have been found on islands across the Pacific before, but these are the oldest known examples of their kind.\n\nThe lures use at least one piece of cowrie shell (Cypraea) \u2013 a type of sea snail \u2013 lashed onto a sinking stone, which is then dropped into the water and manipulated by an attached fibre line. The shell cap and an attached stick mimics the octopus\u2019 favourite snail food, luring it out and either activating a hook on the lure or being caught by spear, net, or by hand.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of archaeological layers in the ground was used to confirm the ages of the artefacts, which were excavated between 2011 to 2016. The research has been published in the journal World Archaeology.\n\n(Top image) A re-created example of an ancient octopus lure from Tonga housed at the Pitt Rivers Museum in England. The lure is made from two cowrie shells, each with drilled holes, bound to a stone sinker using a fiber cord.

Researchers from the University of Western Australia, CSIRO and University of Tasmania studied Antarctica\u2019s sub-ice geology along the continent\u2019s Amundsen and Siple Coasts, Wilkes Land and Recovery regions, and found sedimentary basins beneath the ice at low-level positions of Earth\u2019s crust. These basins contain large volumes of groundwater. As glaciers retreat, the basins can discharge the groundwater, which in turn leads to an increased rate of ice loss. The increase in global ocean and surface temperatures due to climate change is the driving force behind the loss of 150 billion tonnes of ice on average each year. Ice melt in turn adds to ongoing sea level rise."

It is also more likely to occur, and with greater severity, in unvaccinated people.\n\n\u201cAnd even though there is a small risk of side effects associated with the vaccine, the risk with not getting the vaccine is at least 10 times higher,\u201d Varma says.\n\n\u201cSo if you got COVID-19, your risk of having significant problems was much, much higher than any potential side effects that could be occurring after taking the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe patients whose data was analysed as part of this study will be followed up one year after their discharge from hospital.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going, it\u2019s remained a mild disease so far, which is very reassuring.\u201d\n\nOver 95% of the population has received two doses of approved vaccines, and no more than 2 in 100,000 to receive an mRNA-based vaccine experience myocarditis, so the risk of the side-effect remains very low."

As soon as these deepfakes' heads turn 90 degrees to either side, the otherwise photorealistic illusion falls apart.\n\nThe trick could come in handy in the near future \u2014 think of this as a potential CAPTCHA for deepfakes. As the Better Business Bureau and even the FBI recently warned us, scammers could easily make use of the technology to steal money or sensitive information.\n\nDeep Limitations\n\nThe trick works because most deepfake algorithms are based on mostly front-on facial alignments. In fact, most of the visual content that exists out there most of the time doesn't include profile shots \u2014 because it simply isn't desired.\n\n\"The profile is a big problem for current deepfake technologies,\" Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told Metaphysic.\n\n\"Probably the best an algorithm can do is to roughly estimate the profile, particularly if the person is enacting various expressions, or taking requests from the other correspondent in a video call, or from an automated liveness detection system,\" Lyu added. \"In a case like that, profile estimation is going to be kind of a \u2018guess\u2019, even if you were to have some depth information from some of the more recent sensors in smartphones.\"\n\nBut there are ways around the limitation as well. For instance, the entire head could be replaced with a photorealistic CGI model. With 3D body-scanning technologies, a scammer could conceivably turn their own likeness into somebody else's.\n\nWhile deepfake technologies may have made big strides in recent years, there are some surprisingly easy ways for us to tell truth from fiction. But since time immemorial, fraudsters have found new ways to hide their identities online \u2014 expect them to eventually figure this one out, too.\n\nREAD MORE: To Uncover a Deepfake Video Call, Ask the Caller to Turn Sideways [Metaphysic]\n\n\n\nMore on deepfakes: Eerie Deepfake Tech Turns Random Guy Into Angelina Jolie\n\n"

        "title": "From the Dept. of...Aug 7 on futurismReview: The EF ECOFLOW Delta Max Solar Panel Bundle is Portable, Powerful, and Sustainable",
        "link": "https://futurism.com/review-ef-ecoflow-delta-max-solar-panel-bundle",
        "text": "Solar is one of the most well-known renewable energy sources , but harnessing it for personal use has been difficult, especially if you're unable to install permanent panels on the top of your home. The EF ECOFLOW Solar Generator Delta Max and Solar Panel Bundle aims to change that, and it succeeds if your needs fall within its power output limitations.\n\nBefore we get into the tech specs, it's important to report that this bundle costs $2,199 at the time this review is being published. That's a big investment to make, especially when you consider the fact that six rooftop solar panels can cost up to $400 less. The difference is that EF ECOFLOW's bundle includes a ultra high-capacity battery to store the energy absorbed by the solar panel. The energy can be used immediately, or saved for emergency situations or multi-day camping trips. This bundle may elicit some immediate sticker shock, but EF ECOFLOW has actually knocked $550 off its original price tag due a price reduction and free coupon provided when you shop on Amazon.\n\nWhat is the EF Ecoflow Delta Max Solar Generator Bundle?\n\nSpecs:\n\nEF ECOFLOW Delta Max\n\n\u2014 Size: 19.6 H X 9.5 L 12 W Inches\n\n\u2014 Weight: 47.9 pounds\n\n\u2014 Capacity: 2,016 WH (watt hours)\n\n\u2014 Ports: Two USB-C, four USB-C, 2 DC, one car output, six AC outputs\n\n\u2014 Maximum Power Output: 2400W (watts)\n\nEF ECOFLOW 220W Solar Panel\n\n\u2014 Size: 32.3 L x 72 W x 1 inches\n\n\u2014 Weight: 20.9 pounds\n\n\u2014 Maximum Power Output: 220W\n\n\u2014 Number of Panels: Four\n\nMy interest in solar energy has led me to trying out low-powered panels from companies like Grouphug and Anker, which are designed to charge portable electronics like a smartphone, tablet, or handheld game console. While impressive for their size, these solar panels lack the power output necessary to charge or run larger gadgets, be they laptops or small appliances. EF ECOFLOW's 220W solar panel can absorb and convert far more energy from the sun, and the Delta Max allows you to easily use it to power much more demanding gadgets. These are the most powerful sustainability tools I've tested in my career, and they've recalibrated my expectations for solar powered technology in the future.\n\nSetup\n\nIf you've never used a solar panel before, you'll be happy to learn that EF ECOFLOW has made the setup process pretty painless. Using its instructions, I was able to set up the 220W Solar Panel and connect it to the Delta Max in about 20 minutes. It's important to recognize that I did need the help of a friend to set up the solar panel because it's several feet long when it's fully unfolded. This makes it unwieldy to move around as one person. You may be able to assemble it on your own if you lean the panel against the side of a house, or other tall, sturdy surface.\n\nSetting up EF ECOFLOW's solar panel had three basic steps: removing it from the included carrying case, unfolding it to reveal its four-panel array, and attaching the panel to its opened carrying case using a set of included clips and straps. That last step is what required me to seek a friend's help. The opened case acts as a stand for the solar panel, and angles it upward to absorb the sun's rays more effectively. Attaching the two pieces to one another is pretty simple because the solar panel has holes on its top and bottom edges, so you'll know the exact places to hook the case onto. I shouldn't have been surprised that EF ECOFLOW's solar panel case could be used for more than just protection and easy transportation, but I was.\n\nWith the solar panel set up, it was time to connect it to the Delta Max Solar Generator. This gadget looked imposing, and weighed a ton, but was incredibly easy to use. All I had to do was connect the solar panel's power cable to a port on the Delta Max. The solar generator instantly recognized the solar panel and began charging. The Delta Max's screen showed its current charging rate (measured in watts), along with how many hours it would take to fully recharge the battery inside. This was extremely helpful because it let me know whether I had to move the solar panel around, or adjust its angle. It's common sense that a solar panel will be more effective when you move it away from shade cast by a tree or the side of a house; knowing that a half turn to the left can increase the panel's effectiveness by 15 percent is much less intuitive.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nI tested the solar panel's efficiency in a couple of spots on the front lawn of a suburban home on a sunny day, and saw firsthand how much moving it around can make. In a slightly shaded area, EF ECOFLOW's solar panel was only transferring energy to the Delta Max at a rate of between 10 and 20 watts. It would have taken dozens of hours to charge it up at that rate. By moving it into a sunny spot, the solar panel was charging the Delta Max at a rate of 140 watts, and would recharge the solar generator in 11 hours. Yes, that's still a long time, but the difference was remarkable. It should be said that you can charge the Delta Max by plugging it into an outlet \u2014 which admittedly takes less time because there's no variability in how much energy it's absorbing \u2014 so you're not out of luck if weather is crummy.\n\nThe bundle I was sent for review had a single solar panel, but you can hook two of them up to the Delta Max at one time. Under optimal conditions, you can charge the Delta Max at a rate of up to 440 watts. Based on my experience, that'd mean being able to fully recharge the Delta Max in just between five to six hours. Each solar panel costs $549, though, which makes its very expensive proposition. We hope that improvements in manufacturing processes lead to price cuts on solar panels over the next few years regardless of the manufacturer. EF ECOFLOW says you can use any solar panels that use the same \"EcoFlow Solar Connectors,\" aka plugs that can connect to the ports found on the Delta Max.\n\nSpace and Charging Considerations\n\nA persistent problem you may have when using a solar panel to charge the Delta Max is finding enough space to set it up. The solar panel requires several feet of clearance when it's unfolded, which makes it a no-go in crowded areas, including densely populated public campgrounds. If you have the luxury of a front or backyard that gets good sun coverage, or take trips to a private campground there's no doubt that EF ECOFLOW's bundle of a solar panel and the Delta Max can help you use renewable energy more easily, but space is an absolute necessity. It's worth noting that the EF ECOFLOW's solar panel is pretty compact when it's folded up. This is helpful for both at-home storage and for times when you want to pack the solar panel up in your car. The solar panel's protective case has a handle, which makes it easy to carry around, too.\n\nAt first glance, EF ECOFLOW's Delta Max may look like the more boring part of the company's sustainability tech bundle because it can be written off as a huge battery pack. That's true to some extent, but the Delta Max is so well constructed and thoughtfully designed that it's worth recommending on its own. The 48-pound solar generator has a capacity of 2016 WH (watt Hours) and can output up to 2,400 watts of electricity at a time. EF ECOFLOW says the Delta Max can be fully recharged in about 65 minutes when connected to an outlet using the included AC adapter, though I stuck to solar charging during my tests.\n\nThe Delta Max's high battery capacity and generous number of outputs makes it a natural choice for campers, or anyone who wants to be prepared to power their essential electronics in the event of a blackout. The frontside of the Delta Max features two 100-watt USB-C PD (Power Delivery) ports and four USB-A ports, two of which support fast charging speeds. These ports are perfect for charging smartphones, tablets, game consoles, headphones, Bluetooth speakers, and all manner of other portable electronic devices. I connected a handful of gadgets from these categories to the Delta Max at once and all of them started charging immediately.\n\nThe Delta Max's front side also houses its LED color display, which shows how much power it's outputting in real time, and how many hours it can run before running out of juice. This is extremely helpful information because it'll help you moderate your energy use to avoid dealing with a dead battery. The Delta Max's screen also includes the traditional battery percentage number, which ticks down as you use it. You can check the solar generator's energy levels by staring at the screen, but you also have the option to monitor that information on the go using the EcoFlow mobile app. The app is entirely optional, and is not required to use the Delta Max. That said, it was helpful to keep tabs on its battery levels when I wasn't in the same room.\n\nUsing this feature requires you to create an EcoFlow account, and keep the Delta Max in an area where it can maintain a strong connection to an active WiFi connection. The app walks you through the process of how to connect the power generator to your phone, and eventually the internet, and is pretty user-friendly. Overall, I'm happy that the app exists, but glad it's not a requirement.\n\nOn the back of the Delta Max, you'll find six AC outlets, a car power outlet, and two DC outlets. The car power outlet was of particular interest to me because one of the gadgets I rely on regularly is a tire inflator that's powered using that connector. Sure enough, the inflator sprang to life when I plugged it in and hit its power button. I'll always keep the tire inflator in my car, but it's good to know that I can rely on the Delta Max if I decide to inflate bike tires indoors. While the solar generator's car power outlet served one of my niche needs, its AC plugs are the real stars of the show. These ports allow you to use the Delta Max to power appliances like coffee makers, microwaves, and toasters, or high-powered electronics like big-screen TVs and party speakers.\n\nBattery Power\n\nMy big battery test was using the Delta Max to charge an electric bicycle. In one hour, the solar generator charged the bike's battery by approximately 30 percent (its screen doesn't show battery percentages) while draining the Delta Max by only 7 percent. During that test, the Delta Max displayed that it was outputting power at a rate of approximately 120 watts, and could sustain that level of energy output for 14 hours. That means I could fully recharge the bike several times before having to top up the Delta Max. Since I used solar energy to charge it, my entire e-bike charging system used 100 percent renewable energy. It may seem a little idealistic considering the price and space requirements of EF ECOFLOW's bundle, but it was the highlight of my testing time with these gadgets.\n\nEF ECOFLOW says the Delta Max should last 800 recharge cycles, which may seem alarmingly low at first, but makes sense if you take a step back. This isn't an inexpensive battery pack you'll drain and recharge after a day of casual use, it's designed for extreme conditions like camping or multi-day blackouts. You may only recharge the Delta Max once per month, in which case the solar generator would last 66 years without needing to be replaced. If you charged it once a week, the Delta Max could continue to hold a charge for 15 years. You may also be worried about the Delta Max slowly losing its charge while sitting on a shelf between charges, but I didn't find that to be the case. The solar generator kept the exact level of charge after two weeks of not being used. You should check the Delta Max once every couple of months to make sure it hasn't lost a charge, but I wouldn't worry too much about it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThree final observations about the Delta Max that stood out to me. First, its weight didn't turn out to be much of an issue because of the handles on either side of its top piece, which made it easy to move around. The solar generator still weighs close to 50 pounds, but the handles helped a lot. Second, you need to press a button on the front and back of the Delta Max to turn on its two sets of ports. This prevents the solar generator from supplying energy to both sets of ports when only one set is required, saving power. Third, the Delta Max's screen will show the ports that are currently being used by displaying a small picture of it beneath the battery indicator. The utility of these three design details didn't occur to me at the time, but stuck out upon reflection.\n\nThe price of EF ECOFLOW's bundle is pretty steep, but fully worthwhile when you consider how well both its solar panel and solar generator perform. The fact that the Delta Max has the flexibility to be charged independently of the solar panel, or with multiple panels connected, makes it an especially compelling tool to use during parking lot tailgates, beach parties, and other gatherings. The age of consumer-level solar charging equipment has begun, and if the gear I've tested from EF ECOFLOW is any indication, it couldn't come quickly enough.\n\nBuy Now\n\nThis post was created by a non-news editorial team at Recurrent Media, Futurism\u2019s owner.

        "text": "In a laboratory experiment, a strong T-cell response against the coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms was linked to greater covid-19 immunity\n\nAntibodies attacking SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that can cause covid-19 Shutterstock/Kateryna Kon\n\nPeople with a stronger immune response to the coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms may be better protected against covid-19, raising hopes that a pan-coronavirus vaccine could be achieved.\n\nRicardo da Silva Antunes at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and his colleagues analysed blood samples collected from 32 people between 2016 and 2019, before covid-19 emerged.\n\nMultiple samples were taken from each person over six months to three years. The team wanted to see how the immune cells in these samples responded to four coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms as well as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, which emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the coronavirus class, seven strains are known to infect humans. Of these, four viruses cause common cold-like symptoms. There is also SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nAntunes says it was important to use samples taken before the pandemic. \u201cThis means that when we\u2019re looking at our results, we know that they are caused by pre-existing immune memory and that they\u2019re not contaminated by people\u2019s immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has similar genetic sequences to the four common cold-like coronaviruses, says Antunes. Previous studies also suggest that stronger T-cell responses induced by prior coronaviruses may protect against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the latest study, the researchers combined the participants\u2019 blood with peptides \u2013 strings of amino acids \u2013 from the different coronaviruses. Immune responses are typically triggered by the body recognising the peptides of a virus. Next, they measured the T-cell and antibody responses in the blood when exposed to these viruses.\n\nLooking at multiple samples from each participant, the researchers found the T-cell and antibody responses were stable and persistent for all four common cold-like coronaviruses.\n\nBy looking at the T-cells, some of which are more likely to be activated by recent re-infections, they determined these immune responses weren\u2019t due to regular re-infections. Instead, this immune response may be relatively stable.\n\nAntunes speculates that if these common cold-like coronaviruses elicit similar immune responses, it may generate a stable immune memory.\n\nRead more: One in 8 people got long covid after infection early in the pandemic\n\nIn the second part of the experiment, the researchers combined the participants\u2019 blood with SARS-CoV-2. They found that those with the strongest T-cell immune response to the common cold-like coronaviruses had the strongest response to SARS-CoV-2. The same wasn\u2019t found for antibody levels.\n\nBut the participants with stronger responses against common cold-like coronaviruses weren\u2019t necessarily less likely to experience severe covid-19, says Antunes. \u201cThe link between [the common] cold response and SARS-CoV-2 response is still not clear,\u201d he says. Assuming most people have been exposed to common cold-like coronaviruses throughout their life, it isn\u2019t clear why some still become severely ill with covid-19.\n\nOverall, similar findings are expected with newer SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as omicron, as the mutations that result in these variants haven\u2019t been found to affect the T-cell response much, says Antunes.\n\nAccording to Mala Maini at University College London, the study adds to the evidence that suggests T-cell immunity to common cold-like coronaviruses shapes our SARS-CoV-2 response.\n\nHer team is working on a pan-coronavirus vaccine that targets a genetic sequence shared between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold-like coronaviruses.\n\nJournal reference: Cell Host & Microbe, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.07.012\n\nSir Patrick Vallance on his role during the covid-19 pandemic Patrick Vallance at New Scientist Live this October"

        "text": "In an amazing feat of human ingenuity and teamwork, the first COVID-19 vaccine was designed, developed, tested, and authorized for emergency use in December 2020. Not only was this normally lengthy process completed in less than a year, it also introduced the novel use of modified mRNA to induce an immune response against an infection. These mRNA vaccines effectively generate antibodies and prevent infection and hospitalization. However, scientists did not know how mRNA vaccines compared to more common vaccine methods nor the mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines induced long-term immunity.\n\nResearchers compared multiple COVID-19 vaccines to compare efficacy and long-term immunity.\n\nTo answer these questions, Shane Crotty and his group at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology performed a head-to-head comparison of four currently used COVID-19 vaccines that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: Pfizer/BioNtech (mRNA), Moderna (mRNA), Janssen/J&J (adenovirus), and Novavax (recombinant protein). In a six-month longitudinal study published in Cell, the researchers examined blood samples from vaccinated and recently infected people for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immune responses.\n\nIn this study, Crotty sought to standardize the methods by which scientists compared these different vaccines. While it\u2019s clear that mRNA vaccines are successful, comparing vaccines in different scientific studies using multiple types of assays remained a challenge. \u201cWe spent 15 months recruiting people and collecting samples so that we could actually run everything in the same labs, on the same machines with controls, so we could really do the head-to-head, high-quality comparison across four different vaccines, which was a big deal, but also against three different kinds of vaccines, which was an even bigger deal,\u201d said Crotty.\n\nCrotty\u2019s experiments revealed some striking results. When compared to samples from primary infections, all vaccines were just as, if not more, effective in inducing a SARS-CoV-2-specific long-term immune response that lasted up to six months. By analyzing the presence of memory B and T cells and measuring their response to in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, the researchers found that mRNA vaccines are just as effective as the traditional protein-based vaccination methods. They also found some notable differences between the vaccine types. \u201cThe most exciting data was to see that in the B cell side of the story, we saw that a g-coupled chemokine receptor called CXCR3 was increased in memory B cells in response to the adenovirus-based vaccine,\u201d said Camila Coelho, a researcher in the Crotty lab and an author of the study. The researchers did not see this phenomenon in the mRNA vaccinated patients. According to Crotty, the consequences of this are still unknown, but these similarities and differences highlight the fact that there is still much to learn about the immune system and vaccine efficacy.\n\n\u201cWe can go forward with this as a common way of making vaccines against new systemic infections.\u201d\n\nSuresh Marulasiddappa, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this has confirmed that the mRNA vaccines are actually a pretty good deal,\u201d said Suresh Marulasiddappa, a professor of immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe can go forward with this as a common way of making vaccines against new systemic infections.\u201d\n\nThe Crotty lab has big plans for the future. \u201cWe are interested in the durability of immunity in people who received the booster and also who get breakthrough infections,\u201d said Zeli Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow working with Crotty and the first author of the study. \u201cWe would like to see what the immunity in these people looks like after six months\u2026or even one year.\u201d\n\nReference"

        "text": "ABOVE: Lindsey Baden Credit: Len Rubenstein\n\nIn April of 2022, almost two and a half years into the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 40 percent of the US population had yet to contract SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Thanks to the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, that percentage is probably smaller now, but there are still some people who don\u2019t seem to have ever had an infection\u2014or at least, they\u2019ve never had symptoms or tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 infections can be totally asymptomatic, and the variant in question as well as other factors can influence testing accuracy, raising the possibility that a person could have had COVID-19 and not been aware of it. In addition to leaving many wondering whether they\u2019ve actually caught the virus, this kind of uncertainty also causes headaches for epidemiologists, especially those who want to track community spread.\n\nGenerally, testing for prior infections involves looking for antibodies that bind to viral proteins, particularly those that target SARS-CoV-2\u2019s nucleocapsid (N) protein (anti-N antibodies), as the available vaccines teach the immune system to spot the virus using its spike (S) protein instead (anti-S antibodies). However, a study published last month in Annals of Internal Medicine finds that antibody testing likely undercounts the number of vaccinated people who have had a previous COVID-19 infection, potentially by as much as 40 percent.\n\nSo, is there any reliable way to test for a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection? The Scientist spoke to Lindsey Baden, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts, to find out.\n\nThe Scientist: Why is it important to know if people have had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLindsey Baden: Given that a fair amount of COVID is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, there are a lot of infections that people don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve had. So it becomes important to understand how much transmission there is in the community to help with epidemiologic studies and other types of studies that better define the burden of infection and transmission.\n\nTS: What are the methods scientists and researchers use to determine if someone has had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: To measure the footprints of the virus after infection, we use molecular markers or antibodies, such as the nucleocapsid antibody.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that the widely used vaccines in the US and Europe . . . are largely based on the spike protein. In this case, the immune response to the spike protein could either be from natural infection or from vaccination. An immune response to the nucleoprotein can only be from exposure to the virus. That isn\u2019t true everywhere in the world, because there are parts of the world that use inactivated COVID vaccines, which have the whole virus. There, some of the nucleoprotein may be present and therefore stimulate that immune response.\n\nTS: How accurate are serological tests in determining if someone has had a SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: That\u2019s a terrific question that\u2019s more complicated than it seems, because one of the things that we have to do [when we] deal with a new virus is understand the immune response to that virus. We have to understand if it behaves like . . . other pathogens. So we are in the process of learning how well these serological tests behave, given that we\u2019ve only been dealing with SARS-CoV-2 for two and a half years. There\u2019s no way for us to know if the immune responses last for three years because we haven\u2019t dealt with the virus that long. One of the other issues is understanding the biology of this immune response. Are there factors that can alter it, such as prior vaccination and then infection? Does that change the way in which the immune response [is] elicited? This is an area of active research.\n\nTS: How long can we typically detect anti-N or anti-S antibodies?\n\nLB: Typically, there\u2019s a decay [in antibody responses] over a year or two\u2014or that\u2019s what we think from natural infection because that\u2019s what would induce this type of antibody response.\n\nWhat came from the Annals study was showing that by vaccinating, we alter some of the immune kinetics.\n\nTS: Is there any way that scientists can definitively determine if someone has had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: I think the nucleocapsid antibody response is very reliable. But what we\u2019re learning is that in people that have been vaccinated, an immune response may not be elicited. There are a variety of other immune response[s] that can be looked at, like antibody responses to other viral proteins and T cell responses.\n\nT cells . . . react to specific viral epitopes, often short protein sequences. And so one can look for T cell responses against other parts of the viral genome that are not part of the vaccine, basically looking at if T cells can detect those proteins. These methods could be useful. One would only have an immune response to those proteins if you\u2019ve seen them before. One has to be careful about cross-reaction to other coronaviruses and you have to choose sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2, but that\u2019s easily done in the laboratory. But these methods aren\u2019t validated yet and we don\u2019t know how accurate they are.\n\n[This avenue of research] helps us define with detail . . . who\u2019s infected or not, but it\u2019s not scalable [to] a population level. That\u2019s why we use antibody responses\u2014[they\u2019re] very fast, easily deployed laboratory tests that can measure nucleocapsid antibod[ies] and therefore screen thousands and thousands of samples in a lab in a day.\n\nTS: Is there any method that would be the most accurate?\n\nLB: I\u2019m not sure we have that information. What came from the Annals study was showing that by vaccinating, we alter some of the immune kinetics. Part of what we have to realize with COVID is we\u2019re learning as we go. As the virus changes and as our response to the virus changes, that may alter the biology, and we have to study it to understand it. It may well be that if you have such a mild infection, you don\u2019t even stimulate an immune response. At some level, that may not be a bad thing, as long as it\u2019s not being spread to vulnerable people. So we have to think carefully about what we mean by protection from COVID. The immune system can abort infections at a very early stage, if it\u2019s primed. This has gone on with many other viruses over decades, or millennia, actually, in terms of other viruses that we\u2019ve all learned to live with.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for brevity."

        "text": "A solar storm slammed into Earth over the weekend, and it's possible that another one could strike later on Monday (Aug. 8).\n\nClassified as \"moderate\" by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (opens in new tab), the G2 geomagnetic storm, which pummeled our planet on Sunday (Aug. 7), was the result of a solar wind stream, or charged particles from the sun, striking Earth's magnetic field. A second storm, classified as a G1 or \"minor\" storm, may hit sometime today, NOAA predicted.\n\nAccording to SpaceWeather.com (opens in new tab), the weekend storm, which was not forecasted and came \"unexpectedly,\" reached speeds of up to 373 miles per second (600 kilometers per second). Solar winds have been known to reach speeds of 500 miles per second (800 km) according to Space.com .\n\nIf another storm does hit, NOAA reported that high-latitude power systems could be impacted, which could potentially lead to issues for power grids and GPS devices. Spacecraft in orbit also could be affected, due to an increase in high-energy electrons within the magnetosphere , as well as animal behavior, as some migratory animals rely on Earth's magnetic field to navigate, Newsweek (opens in new tab) reported.\n\nRelated: Solar storm from hole in the sun will hit Earth on Wednesday (Aug. 3)\n\nThe sun is spitting out solar storms left and right these days, as it's reaching the peak of its roughly 11-year cycle, Live Science previously reported. Because of this, it's more likely that sunspots, which NASA (opens in new tab) defines as areas of the sun that appear dark due to being cooler than elsewhere on the sun's surface, will likely pop up, resulting in additional solar events. These spots appear cooler and darker than their surroundings due to strong magnetic fields inhibiting the influx of hot, new gas from the sun's interior, according to Space.com .\n\nThe ensuing solar storm sent social media ablaze, particularly in North America, where people were uploading aurora, or Northern Lights , sightings of the sky bursting into brilliant shades of purple and red.\n\nTamitha Skov, a space physicist who goes by the pseudonym \"Space Weather Woman,\" tweeted on Sunday: \"We've jumped to G2-levels, mainly due to north-south-north flipping of the solar magnetic field.\" Every 11 years, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles will flip, causing the south pole to become the north pole and vice versa, according to the Australian Academy of Science (opens in new tab).\n\nThe NOAA ranks solar storms on a five-level scale, with G5 being the highest. The worst solar storm ever documented occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. During that historic storm, the aurora borealis was seen as far south as Hawaii, and telegraph equipment sparked so wildly that offices were set on fire, according to Space.com .\n\nOriginally published on Live Science."

        "link": "https://www.livescience.com/what-is-binge-eating-disorder",
        "text": "Binge eating disorder is part of a group of mental illnesses known as eating disorders. It is grouped with anorexia nervosa, bulimia, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), all of which are conditions where patients display unhealthy relationships with food and disordered eating patterns.\n\nThose with an eating disorder may find themselves eating too much or too little, or worrying excessively about weight or body image. While anyone can get an eating disorder at any time of life, binge eating disorder is most common in those in their late teens and early twenties.\n\nBinge eating disorder is characterized by eating large amounts of food in a short space of time. These so-called \u2018binges\u2019 are often planned ahead of time, involve \u2018special\u2019 or usually restricted foods, and are undertaken alone. There is often a lot of shame and emotional turmoil associated with a binge session, and a binge may be followed by a period of restriction in an attempt to \u2018get back on track\u2019.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll look into the symptoms of binge eating disorder, treatments and diagnostic processes, as well as available support. This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice. A medical doctor or GP should always be the first step in helping assess the severity of an eating disorder and providing support.\n\nWhat is binge eating disorder?\n\nAccording to a review in the journal of Psychiatric Clinics of North America (opens in new tab), binge eating disorder as the most common eating disorder, with the Osteopathic Family Physician (opens in new tab) journal stating that less than half of people with binge eating disorder will receive treatment. Additionally, 3.5% of American women and 2% of American men will experience an eating disorder at some point in their lifetimes, as stated in the journal of Biological Psychiatry (opens in new tab).\n\nDarren Woodward, a qualified psychotherapist and the principal of livelife (opens in new tab), outlines binge eating disorder and the warning signs that someone may be developing this condition. \u201cBinge eating disorder is when a person eats in a short period of time (for example, within any two-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people eat these large quantities of food, they can feel like they are not in control.\u201d\n\nWhat are the symptoms of binge eating disorder?\n\nMarianna Ashurova, a medical doctor and interim physician-in-charge for the Eating Disorders Program at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center in New York, explains symptoms that raise flags for eating disorder professionals. \u201cBinge eating disorder is a clinical diagnosis made by a trained provider that includes symptoms such as eating larger amounts of food than the average person may in one sitting, along with feeling a lack of control over consumption,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cPeople will often describe eating past being comfortably full, eating rapidly or in secret, and feeling disgusted by their food consumption. This occurs about once a week for three months. Binge eating disorder is associated with different risk factors including being overweight, high dissatisfaction with body image, and dieting behaviors. A history of emotional or physical abuse, as well as food insecurity and lack of availability in childhood, are implicated as risk factors as well. For many, binge eating can be used as a method of emotional regulation, placing more emotionally vulnerable populations at higher risk.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nDespite the prevalence of eating disorders in certain populations, black, indiginous and people of color are half as likely to receive treatment than white people, according to a Harvard School of Public Health (opens in new tab) report into the economic cost of eating disorders. A NEDA (opens in new tab) report into eating disorders in the LGBTQ+ community found that gay men are seven times more likely to report binge-eating and 12 times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Another study in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry (opens in new tab) found that 20-30% of adults with eating disorders also have autism.\n\nWoodward explains that secrecy is often an element in binge eating disorder. \u201cThis could involve eating when not hungry and eating alone or secretly,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes people might have a particular or favorite type of food to binge. Binges can often be distressing and involve eating a larger amount of food that the person wanted to eat.\u201d\n\nHow is binge eating disorder diagnosed?\n\n\u201cBinge eating disorder is one of the most common eating disorders,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cBoth men and women can get it, but it typically starts in teenage years or when someone is in their 20s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that binge eating disorder affects everyone differently; behaviors will not be the same and they fall within a spectrum. This could be infrequent emotional overeating, which would be classed as \u2018eating behavior\u2019, to frequent, distressing and compulsive binge eating, which can be classed as an eating disorder. The GP or medical doctor will be the first step in helping assess the severity and next step of support. This may include a referral to psychiatry for a psychiatric assessment. This will involve being asked about your eating habits and how you\u2019re feeling, leading to potential diagnosis and support.\u201d\n\nWhat are the risks of binge eating disorder?\n\nA review in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (opens in new tab) indicates that while binge eating disorder often occurs in non-obese individuals, it is often associated with weight gain over time and a higher risk of diabetes . As disordered eating habits are often tightly woven with negative body image, weight management in those with binge eating disorder is particularly difficult, and treating the underlying psychological condition is more important than enforced weight loss.\n\nWoodward says that binge eating disorder often goes hand-in-hand with other mental health conditions. \u201cIf people have binge eating disorder, they may have other mental health issues, such as depression , anxiety and low self-worth,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBinge eating disorder may contribute to the worsening of these symptoms. People may feel trapped in a cycle of feeling distressed and compulsive binge eating, which could mean they feel more depressed or have lower self-esteem. It can often, but not always, cause weight gain and there are a number of related health risks associated with this \u2014 high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, for example.\u201d\n\nA review in the Nutrients (opens in new tab) journal also indicates that maladaptive emotion regulation plays a significant role in the development of binge eating disorders. Those who experience symptoms of binge eating disorder tend to suppress their emotions, and eating disorders have been linked to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for binge eating disorder?\n\nA review in the Annals of Internal Medicine (opens in new tab) supports cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for those with binge eating disorder and also indicates the usefulness of medications, such as lisdexamfetamine, SGAs, and topiramate to help reduce binge eating. A combination of medication and therapy is often the most effective approach, but therapy on its own is also a powerful tool in treating binge eating disorder.\n\nLauren Salvatore, a doctor of psychology and the clinical director of the Eating Disorders Day Treatment Program at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center, says that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) are the best treatment options available.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe best treatment options are CBT, which helps you change your thoughts and behaviors around binges, or DBT, which can treat the underlying emotion dysregulation that can lead to binges,\u201d she says. \u201cThese therapies can be delivered individually or in a group format by licensed mental health professionals. Most importantly though is finding a provider who you trust and who makes you feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nWoodward says that you may need to go to your doctor for diagnosis before attempting therapy. \u201cStart with booking an appointment with the GP. It can be hard to take this first step, as sometimes people might struggle to admit they are finding things difficult,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSome people find it helpful to bring a friend or family member to the appointment for additional support. When it comes to specific treatment options, some people might prefer to explore guided self-help programmes: this will include working through self-help books alongside sessions with a therapist. For others, CBT might be the best option. This can take place one-to-one or in a group session. This will involve talking to a therapist about patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors which might be leading to your binge eating disorder. This also could involve discussions about triggers, meal planning and changing negative thoughts \u2013 as well as building new habits,\u201d he says.\n\nSupport for binge eating disorder\n\nSalvatore recommends the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) for specialist, judgment-free support. \u201cThere, you can find resources on treatment, providers and how to know when to seek help,\u201d she says.\n\nThe NEDA also has a helpline for those in acute crisis, or you can text if you prefer.. It has a quick screening tool available for those concerned about themselves or a loved one to see if it\u2019s time to seek professional help. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (opens in new tab) (ANAD) also has a daytime helpline and can set you up with an eating disorder support group, or mentor, to help you to take steps towards recovery.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice."

        "text": "Explorers abseiled, squeezed and crawled their way through Australia's deepest cave system on July 30, boldly going where no cavers had gone before and setting a new cave depth record.\n\nCavers from the Southern Tasmanian Caverneers, a speleological organization based in Hobart, Australia, made it through the 1,316-foot-deep (401 meters) cave in Tasmania, an island south of mainland Australia. Stephen Fordyce, who first discovered the cave and organized the expedition, named the cave \"Delta Variant\" after the delta variant of COVID-19 to remind future cavers of current events, according to a statement released by Southern Tasmanian Caverneers.\n\nThe team spent 14 hours underground, navigating a subterranean system that included a 535-foot-tall (163 m) waterfall.

        "text": "Paris, the capital of France, is awash with history; it's home to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre , the world's most-visited museum (opens in new tab).\n\nYet, despite the city's wealth of cultural hotspots, architectural delights and superb restaurants (it currently has over 90 Michelin one-star (opens in new tab) eateries) some tourists find themselves unable to enjoy a trip to Paris. A small percentage of those who venture to The City of Light experience \"Paris syndrome,\" a psychological condition with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate.\n\nBut what, exactly, is Paris syndrome? Who tends to be affected by it, and why?\n\nThough not indexed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Paris syndrome is recognized by many experts as a real, though rare, phenomenon. According to Mathieu Deflem, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina, Paris syndrome is \"most common among Japanese\" tourists. Why, then, are Japanese people so susceptible?\n\n\"We are talking about a culture that, historically, had a completely different belief system and development trajectory from places in Europe,\" Rodanthi Tzanelli, a professor of cultural sociology at the University of Leeds in the U.K., told Live Science. These cultural differences, as well as likely unmet romantic expectations, may explain why Japanese visitors are at an elevated risk for Paris syndrome.\n\nRelated: Did Marie Antoinette really say 'Let them eat cake'?\n\nNausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate are all symptoms of Paris syndrome. (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nParis syndrome should be regarded as an extreme form of culture shock, Deflem said. Culture shock can, in particularly severe cases, result in people feeling disorientated, depressed, irritable and physically ill, according to the University of the Pacific in California (opens in new tab).\n\n\n\n\"Culture shock is an illness resulting from the loss of meaning brought about when people from one symbolic reality find themselves immersed in another,\" Rachel Irwin, now a cultural sciences researcher at Lund University in Sweden, wrote in a 2007 article (opens in new tab). In other words, people can become bewildered \u2014 sometimes to a significant degree \u2014 when surrounded by symbols (logos, names, signs, brands) that are different from those they would usually encounter.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms associated with culture shock are similar to those experienced by someone who is feeling anxious. According to Calm Clinic (opens in new tab), a mental health resource website, when someone is experiencing anxiety, signals will be sent to the stomach that are \"related to the fight or flight response.\" As a result, the \"signals alter the way that the stomach and gut process and digest food, causing nausea.\" In particularly extreme cases of anxiety \u2014 as with culture shock \u2014 this nausea can lead to vomiting, disorientation and a host of other physical reactions.\n\n\n\nWhile everybody experiences culture shock \"in one form or another when visiting somewhere new,\" some people feel it in more pronounced and visceral ways when presented with a culture that is \"unexpected or nuanced,\" according to Deflem.\n\nWith regard to Paris syndrome specifically, \"a number of factors are at work,\" Deflem told Live Science. \"It will be a combination of expectations from Japanese culture and the reality of Paris.\"\n\nDeflem noted that, generally speaking, Japanese culture has a somewhat romanticized view of the West, \"especially Europe.\" This, Deflem suggests, is largely down to how Paris is represented in films \u2014 such as \"Am\u00e9lie\" (Miramax Films, 2001), \"Before Sunset\" (Warner Independent Pictures, 2004) and \"An American in Paris\" (Loew's Inc., 1954) \u2014 and books \u2014 \"A Night at the Majestic\" (Faber and Faber, 2006), \"The Ladies' Delight\" (1883) and \"A Moveable Feast\" (Scribner Classic, 1964) \u2014 which tend to focus on art, coffee culture, quaint restaurants and cordial, intelligent conversation. He suggested that these expectations are \"not realistic, especially in Paris, which is not known for being hospitable.\"\n\nIndeed, a 2014 study carried out by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler (opens in new tab) named Paris the world's fourth most unfriendly city; a 2020 study by CEOWORLD magazine (opens in new tab) awarded Paris the title of rudest city in Europe; and a 2021 survey by InterNations (opens in new tab), an organization dedicated to helping people relocate, concluded that Paris is Europe's third-least-friendly city for expats.\n\nRelated: How did bachelor and bachelorette parties get started?\n\nReality hits hard when visitors to Paris are forced to take off the rose-tinted glasses of which they've been viewing the city of romance. (Image credit: by-studio via Getty Images)\n\nIn popular culture, \"Paris is presented in ways that do not reflect the realities of the city, especially not in recent times, when much of Paris is no longer the France of old,\" Deflem said.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Deflem highlighted that \"Japan, for example, has a very orderly and polite culture,\" while Parisian everyday life is less so \"despite its image,\" he said. \"Parisians can sometimes be guilty of looking down on people \u2014 even non-Parisian French \u2014 which is seldom seen in Japanese culture. The confrontation is sharp.\"\n\nAccording to Deflem, \"very subtle differences\" regarding cultural norms or societal expectations can cause confusion because \"it makes situations tricky to navigate.\" Such misunderstandings can be difficult for tourists because it is hard to know when a \"particular value is at play, when to apologize, when not to ask a question etc. Culture is complex.\"\n\nBut could visitors to other cities experience similar feelings? Might someone exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with Paris syndrome in other historic cities, such as Vienna, New York or Beijing?\n\nTzanelli thinks Paris syndrome may not be specific to the French capital. Rather, she regards it as \"a very complex psychic phenomenon that has to do with disappointment, even despair, about the ways reality does not match our romantic expectations.\"\n\nThe syndrome is likely a \"generational phenomenon,\" because younger generations tend to be \"more globetrotting,\" and therefore are likely to be more prepared for what they will experience at a destination, she added.\n\nHowever, Tzanelli is keen to point out that nobody is immune to culture shock, regardless of their age or the amount they have traveled.\n\n\"We are creatures of habit,\" she said. \"We are inculcated into a particular way of life, adopt behaviors and habits from our surroundings, and become part of a culture and social group. We never think about these things, but habits, behaviors and values always work at the back of who we are and what we do. When we are suddenly taken out of this system of beliefs and habits, out of the ways we structure our life, we are left with no means to frame and define who we are.\"\n\nTzanelli noted that, although she's well acquainted with culture shock and has studied it in detail, she is by no means immune to its effects.\n\n\"I've had this experience [of culture shock] even in places I had previously visited,\" she said. \"Time affects memory, and the stored images we have of places are bound to differ from reality.\"\n\nOriginally published on Live Science."

OP-101 treatment, which targets activated macrophages, was associated with decreased serum concentrations of proinflammatory markers as well as markers of neurological injury (neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein). The drug may have the potential to treat systemic inflammation and brain injury in patients with severe COVID-19 and significantly reduce their chances of death.\n\nThe results of the trial were published in Science Translational Medicine in the article, \u201cDendrimer nanotherapy for severe COVID-19 attenuates inflammation and neurological injury markers and improves outcomes in a Phase IIa clinical trial.\u201d\n\nIn the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive Phase IIa trial, 24 patients classified as having severe COVID-19 across five clinical sites in the United States were randomized to receive a single intravenous dose of placebo (n = 7 patients) or OP-101 at 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6), or 8 mg/kg (n = 5 patients). All patients received standard of care, including corticosteroids.\n\n\u201cOP-101 is a novel nanotherapeutic compound that specifically targets activated macrophages and microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain,\u201d said Aaron M. Gusdon, MD, assistant professor in the Vivian L. Smith department of neurosurgery with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. \u201cDue to its excellent safety profile, we were excited to offer this therapy to these critically ill patients at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\u201d\n\nHyperinflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity in COVID-19. OP-101 was found to be better than a placebo at decreasing inflammatory markers, as well as better at reducing markers of neurological injury, including neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein.\n\nAdditionally, risk for the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 or 60 days after treatment was 71% for patients receiving the placebo, but just 18% for patients in the pooled OP-101 treatment arms. At 60 days after treatment, 3 of 7 patients given placebo and 14 of 17 patients treated with OP-101 survived.\n\nThe data shows that OP-101 was well tolerated in the critically ill patient population and could serve as an effective treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAlthough this was a small-dose escalation trial, there was clearly a strong signal toward benefit at both acute and chronic timepoint,\u201d Gusdon said. \u201cThe possibility that this therapy could also benefit patients with other diseases that lead to systemic inflammatory responses, including various forms of brain injury, is extremely exciting.\u201d"

        "text": "A pan-coronavirus vaccine\u2014one that provides protection against a number of different coronaviruses\u2014is public health\u2019s holy grail. To be effective, the vaccine would need to trigger antibodies that recognize and neutralize a range of coronaviruses, stopping the virus from entering hosts cells and replicating. This type of vaccine is a challenge to develop for coronaviruses, in part, because they frequently mutate and generally induce incomplete protection against reinfection.\n\nAlthough antibody cross-reactivity with the Spike proteins of different coronaviruses, including the common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs), has been shown, the authors of a new paper noted that it is unclear \u201cwhether such antibody responses, typically targeting the conserved S2 subunit, contribute to protection when induced by infection or through vaccination.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers have investigated whether antibodies that target the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein also neutralize other coronaviruses. This specific area of the spike protein tethers it to the virus membrane and allows the virus to fuse with the membrane of a host cell.\n\nThe researchers said their findings \u201cestablish the protective value of an S2-targeting vaccine and support the notion that S2 vaccination may better prepare the immune system to respond to the changing nature of the S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, as well as to future coronavirus zoonoses.\u201d\n\nThe study titled, \u201cSARS-CoV-2 S2-targeted vaccination elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies,\u201d is published in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe expectation for a vaccine that targets the S2 area is that it could offer some protection against all current, as well as future, coronaviruses,\u201d noted George Kassiotis, PhD, principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute. \u201cThis differs from vaccines that target the more variable S1 area which, while effective against the matching variant they are designed against, are less able to target other variants or a broad range of coronaviruses.\u201d\n\nThe S2 area of the spike protein has, until recently, been overlooked as providing a basis for vaccination. This is because certain critical targets in the S2 area are only revealed after the virus has bound to a cell, a process mediated by the S1 area. As a result, there may be a narrower window of opportunity for S2 antibodies to neutralize the virus than for antibodies that target the S1 area.\n\nUsing a mouse model, the team found that prior HCoV-OC43 S\u2013targeted immunity \u201cprimes neutralizing antibody responses to otherwise subimmunogenic SARS-CoV-2 S exposure and promotes S2-targeting antibody responses.\u201d\n\nAfter vaccinating mice with SARS-CoV-2 S2, the mice created antibodies that were able to neutralize a number of other animal and human coronaviruses, including: the seasonal \u201ccommon cold\u201d coronavirus HCoV-OC43, the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, the D614G mutant that dominated in the first wave, Alpha, Beta, Delta, the original Omicron, and two bat coronaviruses.\n\n\u201cThe S2 area of the spike protein is a promising target for a potential pan-coronavirus vaccine because this area is much more similar across different coronaviruses than the S1 area,\u201d noted Kevin Ng, a PhD student in the retrovirus laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute. \u201cIt is less subject to mutations, and so a vaccine targeted at this area should be more robust.\u201d\n\nLastly, in mice with a history of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan\u2013based S vaccination, further S2 vaccination induced broader neutralizing antibody response than booster Wuhan S vaccination, suggesting that \u201cit may prevent repertoire focusing caused by repeated homologous vaccination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile a potential S2 vaccine would not stop people being infected, the idea is it would prime their immune system to respond to a future coronavirus infection,\u201d added Nikhil Faulkner, a PhD student in the retroviral immunology laboratory at the Crick. \u201cThis would hopefully provide enough protection to survive an initial infection during which they could develop further immunity specific to that particular virus.\u201d\n\nThe researchers will continue this work studying the potential of a pan-coronavirus that targets the S2 area of the spike protein and how it could be integrated with currently licensed vaccines."

        "text": "A research team reports discovering a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that it says has the potential to become a universal coronavirus therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and all its variants of concern, including Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron.\n\nIn multiple animal models, the mAb shows effectiveness against the SARS-CoV, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that emerged in China in 2002, and MERS-CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the scientists, who had that it also shows effectiveness against several common cold coronaviruses.\n\nThe mAb targets the S2 stalk region of the viral spike (S) protein that is highly conserved among beta-coronaviruses yet is also essential for the virus to attach and enter cells, leading to infection. The mAb protected against infections when given as an intraperitoneal injection or a nasal dose.\n\nThe study \u201cPotent universal beta-coronavirus therapeutic activity mediated by direct respiratory administration of a Spike S2 domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibody\u201d appears in PLOS Pathogens.\n\n\u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third novel \u03b2-coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades. Although vaccines are available, too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape. To determine if antibodies could be identified with universal coronavirus activity, plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved between human \u03b2-coronavirus,\u201d write the investigators.\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies developed\n\n\u201cFrom these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad hmAb, able to recognize all human \u03b2-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of 1249A8 i.n. dose 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV Urbani strain, protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.\u201d\n\nThe mAb, and mAb discovered earlier by the researchers, are being developed as a therapeutic cocktail for COVID-19 under license to Aridis Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2 marks the third time in the last two decades a beta-coronavirus has caused significant mortality in humans,\u201d says James J. Kobie, PhD, co-senior study author from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 has caused the most infections and deaths worldwide. New variants pose the risk of evading the immune system, even in vaccinated and previously infected individuals, and there remains the potential for other genetically distinct coronaviruses to emerge as new pandemic strains in the future.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, finding new therapeutic and prophylactic drugs and vaccine strategies that have universal activity against the coronavirus is essential for protecting humanity against the current and future beta-coronavirus outbreaks or pandemics.\u201d\n\nVaccines and other monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the receptor-binding domain, or the RBD, located at the heads of the S viral protein spike that projects from the surface of the virus. Each virus has 24 to 40 spikes. The RBD is good at eliciting an immune response, but that portion of the S permits many mutations that can let the virus escape antibodies.\n\nOne key in the present research was finding an antibody target on a part of the spike called the S2, or the stalk region. This region is highly conserved and only rarely mutates because that would disrupt its essential function. After the RBD at the head of the S attaches the coronavirus to a receptor molecule on the surface of a target cell, the S2 stalk acts to bring the virus inside the target cell. There the virus replicates, killing the cell, and releasing a hoard of new, infectious virions.\n\nAridis is using the two hmAbs in its AR-701 cocktail designed for inhaled delivery. AR-701 is engineered for long-acting effectiveness, potentially lasting a year or more when used in humans, according to the company.\n\nAlso involved in the study are researchers from the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Colorado State University."

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association are collaborating to collect and share all publicly available data from states on child COVID-19 cases. The definition of \u201cchild\u201d case is based on varying age ranges reported across states (see report Appendix for details and links to all data sources).\n\nFor the week ending August 4th, almost 97,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, the fourth consecutive weekly increase of reported cases, with around 68,000 cases reported the week ending July 7th. Reported COVID-19 cases among children spiked dramatically in 2022 during the Omicron variant winter surge, peaking at 1,150,000 cases reported in one week. Cases have decreased substantially since the Omicron peak and are similar to what they were one year ago, August 5, 2021, when 94,000 child cases were reported.\n\nNearly 14.2 million children are reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports; over 359,000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks.

For the week ending August 4th, this portion was 13.4% (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). While COVID-19 cases are likely increasingly under-reported for all age groups, this decline indicates that children are disproportionately undercounted in reported COVID-19 cases.\n\nThere is an urgent need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children\u2019s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth.\n\n\n\n"

They experience persistent anosmia or parosmia.\n\nStudies have shown that the olfactory sensory epithelium\u2014located in the upper area of the nose, close to where the olfactory nerve enters the olfactory bulb in the brain\u2014carries a high viral load in people infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe olfactory bulb is the structure in the brain that manages the sense of smell and sends sensory information to other areas of the brain for processing. These other brain regions are involved with learning, memory and emotion.\n\n\u201cAll of this means that the [olfactory bulb] is involved in much more than smelling. It\u2019s involved in the sense of place, memory, context, emotion, reward and many other processes,\u201d said Leslie M. Kay, Ph.D., author of the review.\n\nDue to the proximity of the olfactory sensory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, COVID-19 infection could affect cognitive function even after recovery. A correlation between disrupted sense of smell and dementia has also been found in some people with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Animal studies have shown that damage to the bulb results in anxiety and a depression-like state.\n\nAlthough most people recover quickly from this dysfunction, an estimated 15 million people around the world are considered \u201csmell long haulers\u201d after otherwise recovering from COVID-19. They experience persistent anosmia or parosmia.

The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic led to a wave of people who developed Parkinson\u2019s disease, and data from Denmark find that people who have had the flu have a 70% higher risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease a decade later.\n\n\u201cThe review offers evidence that suggests inflammation introduced to the olfactory nerve and damage to the olfactory bulb via COVID-19 infection and immune response may also cause degeneration of brain structures connected to the olfactory system and cognitive impairment.\n\nMore research is needed and is possible due to the technological advances available to scientists during the current pandemic,\u201d Kay said.\n\n\u201cWhile a catastrophe on many levels, the COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to improve human health.\u201d\n\nAbout this COVID-19 and dementia research news\n\nAuthor: Press Office\n\nSource: APS\n\nContact: Press Office \u2013 APS\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?\u201d by Leslie M. Kay et al. Journal of Neurophysiology\n\nAbstract\n\nCOVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?\n\nOlfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nThe cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral \u2013 inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons.\n\nHowever, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide.\n\nThis epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19 related long term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggests a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Lewy Body dementias.\n\nThus, long term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration.\n\nFew treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment.\n\nThere is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19."

A new study reveals COVID-19 can predispose people to irreversible neurological conditions, accelerate brain aging, and increase the risk of stroke and brain bleeds.\n\nSource: Houston Methodist\n\nA new study by Houston Methodist researchers reviews the emerging insights and evidence that suggest COVID-19 infections may have both short- and long-term neurological effects.\n\nMajor findings include that COVID-19 infections may predispose individuals to developing irreversible neurological conditions, may increase the likelihood of strokes and may increase the chance of developing persistent brain lesions that can lead to brain bleeding.\n\nLed by corresponding authors Joy Mitra, Ph.D., Instructor, and Muralidhar L. Hegde, Ph.D., Professor of Neurosurgery, with the Division of DNA Repair within the Center for Neuroregeneration at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, the research team described their findings in an article titled \u201cSARS-CoV-2 and the Central Nervous System: Emerging Insights into Hemorrhage-Associated Neurological Consequences and Therapeutic Considerations\u201d in the journal Ageing Research Reviews.\n\nStill a major burden on our daily lives, a great deal of research has shown that the impacts of the disease go far beyond the actual time of infection. Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has surpassed a death toll of more than 5.49 million worldwide and more than 307 million confirmed positive cases, with the U.S. accounting for almost 90 million of those cases, according to the Our World in Data website.\n\nCOVID-19 is known to invade and infect the brain, among other major organs. While a lot of research has been done to help us understand the evolution, infection and pathology of the disease, there is still a great deal that remains unclear about the long-term effects, especially on the brain.\n\nThe coronavirus infection can cause long-term and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in the elderly and other vulnerable populations. Several brain imaging studies on COVID-19 victims and survivors have confirmed the formation of microbleed lesions in deeper brain regions related to our cognitive and memory functions.\n\nIn this review study, researchers have critically evaluated the possible chronic neuropathological outcomes in aging and comorbid populations if timely therapeutic intervention is not implemented.\n\nMicrobleeds are emerging neuropathological signatures frequently identified in people suffering from chronic stress, depressive disorders, diabetes and age-associated comorbidities. Based on their earlier findings, the investigators discuss how COVID-19-induced microhemorrhagic lesions may exacerbate DNA damage in affected brain cells, resulting in neuronal senescence and activation of cell death mechanisms, which ultimately impact brain microstructure-vasculature.\n\nThese pathological phenomena resemble hallmarks of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases and are likely to aggravate advanced-stage dementia, as well as cognitive and motor deficits.\n\nStill a major burden on our daily lives, a great deal of research has shown that the impacts of the disease go far beyond the actual time of infection. Image is in the public domain\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 infection on various aspects of the central nervous system are currently being studied. For instance, 20-30% of COVID-19 patients report a lingering psychological condition known as \u201cbrain fog\u201d where individuals suffer from symptoms such as memory loss, difficulty in concentrating, forgetting daily activities, difficulty in selecting the right words, taking longer than usual time to complete a regular task, disoriented thought processes and emotional numbness.\n\nMore severe long-term effects analyzed in the Houston Methodist review article include predispositions for Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cardiovascular disorders due to internal bleeding and blood clotting-induced lesions in the part of the brain that regulates our respiratory system, following the COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, cellular aging is thought to be accelerated in COVID-19 patients. A plethora of cellular stresses inhibit the virus-infected cells from undergoing their normal biological functions and let them enter into \u201chibernation mode\u201d or even die completely.\n\nThe study also suggests various strategies to improve some of these long-term neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative outcomes, as well as outlines the importance of the therapeutic regimen of the \u201cnanozyme\u201d in combination with various FDA-approved drugs that may prove successful to fight against this catastrophic disease.\n\nHowever, given the ever-evolving nature of this field, associations like the ones described in this review show the fight against COVID-19 is far from over, say the investigators, and reinforce the message that getting vaccinated and maintaining proper hygiene are key in trying to prevent such long-term and detrimental consequences.\n\nAbout this COVID-19 and neurology research news\n\nAuthor: Press Office\n\nSource: Houston Methodist\n\nContact: Press Office \u2013 Houston Methodist\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system: Emerging insights into hemorrhage-associated neurological consequences and therapeutic considerations\u201d by Joy Mitra et al. Ageing Research Reviews\n\nAbstract\n\nSARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system: Emerging insights into hemorrhage-associated neurological consequences and therapeutic considerations\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to impact our lives by causing widespread illness and death and poses a threat due to the possibility of emerging strains. SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering vital organs of the body, including the brain. Studies have shown systemic inflammation, cellular senescence, and viral toxicity-mediated multi-organ failure occur during infectious periods.\n\nHowever, prognostic investigations suggest that both acute and long-term neurological complications, including predisposition to irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, can be a serious concern for COVID-19 survivors, especially the elderly population.\n\nAs emerging studies reveal sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different parts of the brain, potential causes of chronic lesions including cerebral and deep-brain microbleeds and the likelihood of developing stroke-like pathologies increases, with critical long-term consequences, particularly for individuals with neuropathological and/or age-associated comorbid conditions.\n\nOur recent studies linking the blood degradation products to genome instability, leading to cellular senescence and ferroptosis, raise the possibility of similar neurovascular events as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIn this review, we discuss the neuropathological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID survivors, focusing on possible hemorrhagic damage in brain cells, its association to aging, and the future directions in developing mechanism-guided therapeutic strategies."

        "text": "Summary: Fatigue and headaches top the list of common lingering symptoms four months after COVID infection, with muscle aches, changes in sense of taste and smell, cough, and congestion following close behind.\n\nSource: Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University\n\nFatigue and headache were the most common symptoms reported by individuals an average of more than four months out from having COVID-19, investigators report.\n\nMuscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion were next in the long line of lingering symptoms.\n\n\u201cOur results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infections,\u201d Medical College of Georgia investigators write in the journal ScienceDirect.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of symptoms that we did not know early on in the pandemic what to make of them, but now it\u2019s clear there is a long COVID syndrome and that a lot of people are affected,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Rutkowski, MCG neurologist and the study\u2019s corresponding author.\n\nThe published study reports on preliminary findings from the first visit of the first 200 patients enrolled in the COVID-19 Neurological and Molecular Prospective Cohort Study in Georgia, or CONGA, who were recruited on average about 125 days after testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nCONGA was established at MCG early in the pandemic in 2020 to examine the severity and longevity of neurological problems and began enrolling participants in March 2020 with the ultimate goal of recruiting 500 over five years.\n\nEighty percent of the first 200 participants reported neurological symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5%, and headache close behind at 66.5%. Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5%) and taste (54%) and nearly half the participants (47%) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, with 30% demonstrating impaired vocabulary and 32% having impaired working memory.\n\nTwenty-one percent reported confusion, and hypertension was the most common medical condition reported by participants in addition to their bout with COVID-19.\n\nNo participants reported having a stroke, weakness or inability to control muscles involved with speaking, and coordination problems were some of the less frequently reported symptoms.\n\nTwenty-five percent met the criteria for depression, and diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and a history of depression were associated with those who met the criteria. Anemia and a history of depression were associated with the 18% who met the objective criteria for anxiety.\n\nWhile the findings to date are not surprising and are consistent with what other investigators are finding, Rutkowski says the fact that symptoms reported by participants often didn\u2019t match what objective testing indicated, was surprising. And, it was bidirectional.\n\nFor example, the majority of participants reported taste and smell changes, but objective testing of both these senses did not always line up with what they reported. In fact, a higher percentage of those who did not report the changes actually had evidence of impaired function based on objective measures, the investigators write.\n\nWhile the reasons are not certain, part of the discrepancy may be a change in the quality of their taste and smell rather than pure impaired ability, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThey eat a chicken sandwich and it tastes like smoke or candles or some weird other thing but our taste strips are trying to depict specific tastes like salty and sweet,\u201d Rutkowski says. Others, for example, may rely on these senses more, even when they are preparing the food, and may be apt to notice even a slight change, she says.\n\nEither way, their data and others suggest a persistent loss of taste and smell following COVID-19, Rutkowski and her colleagues write.\n\nMany earlier reports have been based on these kinds of self-reports, and the discrepancies they are finding indicate that approach may not reflect objective dysfunction, the investigators write.\n\nOn the other hand, cognitive testing may overestimate impairment in disadvantaged populations, they report.\n\nThe first enrollees were largely female, 35.5% were male. They were an average of 44.6 years old, nearly 40% were Black and 7% had been hospitalized because of COVID-19. Black participants were generally disproportionately affected, the investigators say.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Black participants and 23.4% of white participants met criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The findings likely indicate that cognitive tests assess different ethnic groups differently. And, socioeconomic, psychosocial (issues like family problems, depression and sexual abuse) and physical health factors generally may disproportionately affect Black individuals, the investigators write.\n\nIt also could mean that cognitive testing may overestimate clinical impairment in disadvantaged populations, they write.\n\nBlack and Hispanic individuals are considered twice as likely to be hospitalized by COVID-19 and ethnic and racial minorities are more likely to live in areas with higher rates of infection. Genetics also is a likely factor for their increased risk for increased impact from COVID, much like being at higher risk for hypertension and heart disease early and more severely in life.\n\nA focus of CONGA is to try to better understand how increased risk and effects from COVID-19 impact Blacks, who comprise about 33% of the state\u2019s population.\n\nA reason fatigue appears to be such a major factor among those who had COVID-19 is potentially because of levels of inflammation, the body\u2019s natural response to an infection, remain elevated in some individuals. For example, blood samples taken at the initial visit and again on follow up showed some inflammatory markers were up and stayed up in some individuals.\n\nThese findings and others indicate that even though the antibodies to the virus itself may wain, persistent inflammation is contributing to some of the symptoms like fatigue, she says. She notes patients with conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, both considered autoimmune conditions that consequently also have high levels of inflammation, also include fatigue as a top symptom.\n\n\u201cThey have body fatigue where they feel short of breath, they go to get the dishes done and they are feeling palpitations, they immediately have to sit down and they feel muscle soreness like they just ran a mile or more,\u201d Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThere is probably some degree of neurologic fatigue as well because patients also have brain fog, they say it hurts to think, to read even a single email and that their brain is just wiped out,\u201d she says. Some studies have even shown shrinkage of brain volume as a result of even mild to moderate disease.\n\nThese multisystem, ongoing concerns are why some health care facilities have established long COVID clinics where physicians with expertise in the myriad of problems they are experiencing gather to see each patient.\n\nCONGA participants who reported more symptoms and problems tended to have depression and anxiety.\n\nProblems like these as well as mild cognitive impairment and even impaired vocabulary may also reflect the long-term isolation COVID-19 produced for many individuals, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cYou are not doing what you would normally do, like hanging out with your friends, the things that bring most people joy,\u201d Rutkowski says. \u201cOn top of that, you may be dealing with physical ailments, lost friends and family members and loss of your job.\u201d\n\nFor CONGA, participants self-report symptoms and answer questions about their general state of health like whether they smoked, drank alcohol, exercised, and any known preexisting medical conditions. But they also receive an extensive neurological exam that looks at fundamentals like mental status, reflexes and motor function.\n\nThey also take established tests to assess cognitive function with results being age adjusted. They also do at-home extensive testing where they are asked to identify odors and the ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, brothy or no taste. They also have blood analysis done to look for indicators of lingering infection like those inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterization of how symptoms evolve over time, the investigators write.\n\nMuscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion were next in the long line of lingering symptoms. Image is in the public domain\n\nAnd particularly for some individuals, symptoms definitely linger. Even some previously high-functioning individuals, who normally worked 80 hours a week and exercised daily, may find themselves only able to function about an hour a day and be in the bed the remainder, Rutkowski says.\n\nThe investigators are searching for answers to why and how, and while Rutkowski says she cannot yet answer all their questions, she can tell them with certainty that they are not alone or \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nOne of the best things everyone can do moving forward is to remain diligent about avoiding infection, including getting vaccinated or boosted to help protect your brain and body from long COVID symptoms and help protect others from infection, Rutkowski says. There is evidence that the more times you are infected, the higher the risk of ongoing problems.\n\nRutkowski notes that their study findings may be somewhat biased toward high percentages of ongoing symptoms because the study likely is attracting a high percentage of individuals with concerns about ongoing problems.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is thought to have first infected people in late 2019 and is a member of the larger group of coronaviruses, which have been a source of upper respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, in people for years.\n\nAt least part of the reason SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have such a wide-ranging impact is that the virus is known to attach to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, or ACE2, which is pervasive in the body.\n\nACE2 has a key role in functions like regulating blood pressure and inflammation. It\u2019s found on neurons, cells lining the nose, mouth, lungs and blood vessels, as well as the heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. The virus attaches directly to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells, which functions much like a door to let the virus inside.\n\nExperience and study since COVID-19 started both indicate immediate neurological impact can include loss of taste and smell, brain infection, headaches and, less commonly, seizures, stroke and damage or death of nerves.\n\nAs time has passed, there is increasing evidence that problems like loss of taste and smell, can become chronic, as well as problems like brain fog, extreme fatigue, depression, anxiety and insomnia, the investigators write. Persistent conditions including these and others are now referenced as \u201clong Covid.\u201d\n\nFunding: The research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and philanthropic support from the TR Reddy Family Fund.\n\nAbout this COVID-19 research news\n\nAuthor: Toni Baker\n\nSource: Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University\n\nContact: Toni Baker \u2013 Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cNeuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID-19: Pilot results from the COVID-19 neurological and molecular prospective cohort study in Georgia, USA\u201d by Elizabeth Rutkowski et al. Brain, Behavior & Immunity: Health\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID-19: Pilot results from the COVID-19 neurological and molecular prospective cohort study in Georgia, USA\n\nBackground\n\nAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, there has been a growing interest in the chronic sequelae of COVID-19. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterization of how these symptoms evolve over time. Additionally, African American populations have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 Neurological and Molecular Prospective Cohort Study in Georgia (CONGA) was established to investigate the severity and chronicity of these neurologic findings over the five-year period following infection.\n\nMethods\n\nThe CONGA study aims to recruit COVID-19 positive adult patients in Georgia, United States from both the inpatient and outpatient setting, with 50% being African American. This paper reports our preliminary results from the baseline visits of the first 200 patients recruited who were on average 125 days since having a positive COVID-19 test. The demographics, self-reported symptoms, comorbidities, and quantitative measures of depression, anxiety, smell, taste, and cognition were analyzed. Cognitive measures were compared to demographically matched controls. Blood and mononuclear cells were drawn and stored for future analysis.\n\nResults\n\nFatigue was the most reported symptom in the study cohort (68.5%). Thirty percent of participants demonstrated hyposmia and 30% of participants demonstrated hypogeusia. Self-reported neurologic dysfunction did not correlate with dysfunction on quantitative neurologic testing. Additionally, self-reported symptoms and comorbidities were associated with depression and anxiety. The study cohort performed worse on cognitive measures compared to demographically matched controls, and African American patients scored lower compared to non-Hispanic White patients on all quantitative cognitive testing.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Our results suggest that self-reported neurologic symptoms do not appear to correlate with associated quantitative dysfunction, emphasizing the importance of quantitative measurements in the complete assessment of deficits. Self-reported symptoms are associated with depression and anxiety. COVID-19 infection appears to be associated with worse performance on cognitive measures, though the disparity in score between African American patients and non-Hispanic White patients is likely largely due to psychosocial, physical health, and socioeconomic factors."

        "text": "Share on Pinterest An animal study suggests that the COVID-19 oral antiviral pill molnupiravir may work better in males. Ziad Ahmed/NurPhoto via Getty Images Molnupiravir, an oral antiviral pill authorized to treat COVID-19, has been available in the United States and other countries since December 2021.\n\nAntivirals can reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce fatalities among people who are vulnerable to more severe COVID-19.\n\nNew animal research suggests that molnupiravir might work better for the male sex with Omicron infections.\n\nExperts say animal models can be used to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness on different variants, including Omicron, in preclinical trials. While COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in helping reduce the number of fatalities caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections, antivirals also played a part. One of those drugs is molnupiravir, which the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) authorized for use in people over the age of 1 in December 2021. It has been a particularly useful drug as it can be taken orally and at home in a bid to avoid hospitalization. Research published in October 2021 in the BMJ showed that molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization by 50% in people at higher risk of severe COVID-19. A multi-center group of investigators headed by a team at Georgia State University investigated the effect of molnupiravir on different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, on human cells, human cell-derived organoids, ferrets, and dwarf hamsters, with some mixed results. Researchers published the results in Nature Communications .\n\nMolnupiravir for COVID-19 When the drug was initially approved, the FDA noted that new variants of concern meant it was important to expand the number of therapies available while continuing to test their safety and effectiveness. Researchers had well-documented the immune evasion capabilities of new SARS-CoV-2 variants\u2014whether it was immunity gained via vaccination or previous infection. However, it is unclear how variants impact the effectiveness of antiviral drug treatments such as molnupiravir. As molnupiravir works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the viral life cycle in infected cells, studies of its efficacy need to be in the host cells rather than directly on the virus itself, said Dr. Hella Kohlhof, Chief Scientific Officer at Immunic Therapeutics. This host-based approach, such as designing drugs that could have an antiviral effect in the host cell rather than on the virus, could help develop treatments against future variations. Dr. Kohlhof told Medical News Today in an interview that molnupiravir is a relatively broad-based antiviral means that its efficacy should not\u2014in theory\u2014vary between different variants as much as vaccines, which were designed solely to target the spike protein. \u201cVaccination, to be really efficacious, needs to be as specific as possible on certain proteins from the virus. And if you do the antiviral drug development, and if you have this host-based approach, you\u2019re really acting on a mechanism within the infected cell and not on the virus directly,\u201d Dr. Kohlhof explained. It isn\u2019t easy to hold clinical trials for each new variant as these take months. In addition, a new variant may become dominant when the results are published. That\u2019s why it has spurred scientists to develop other models, such as human cells or animals, to test the effect of these antiviral therapies for COVID-19. The World Health Organization , for example, assembled its own COVID-19 modeling expert group in 2020. The group evaluates advances in animal models used as preclinical models. So far, experts have proposed non-human primates, mice, ferrets, and hamsters as potentially useful models. Dr. Simon Funnell, a scientific leader of the U.K. Health Security Agency and a member of the WHO expert group for the past two years, told MNT that one of the outcomes of this work was to highlight the importance of reproducing such findings in more than one species. \u201cExperience has shown, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, that there is great strength in data sharing and verification by independent groups,\u201d Dr. Funnell said. He gave an example of how research around hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 progressed. \u201cThis was the case for the preclinical assessment of hydroxychloroquine where human organ culture findings were supported by non-human primate and other animal model data [that showed it was not an effective drug] despite early findings in Vero cells and mice which suggested it would a beneficial drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d he explained.\n\nTesting molnupiravir in different models For their first experiment, the researchers looked at the drug\u2019s effect on human cells infected with different variants of concern. To do this, they looked at cells in vitro and developed organoids designed to behave like miniature organs made of tissues derived from human cell lines. As part of this experiment, the researchers developed organoids to mimic the epithelium of the lungs in humans, using cells from a male human donor. Their analysis found molnupiravir equally inhibited variants of concern in cells and organoids. They carried out further studies in ferrets, which showed that molnupiravir treatment reduced the shedding of the virus and prevented transmission.\n\nSex differences with Omicron However, one of the more surprising findings from the study was when male dwarf hamsters fared better overall than female hamsters when treated with molnupiravir after infection with Omicron. Researchers did not observe this variation with other variants, which matches previous trials on humans. The study did not investigate the impact of sex on the results in the other models as the only ferrets used were female and the cells used to develop organoids were male. Dr. Funnell said this could have been investigated further: \u201cFemale human donors are available for organoid culture and it seems that this could easily be investigated. The media used for such studies could also be balanced to reflect human hormonal differences in circulating blood.\u201d"

New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nFear and isolation The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress. Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nWorldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d\n\nWho is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d\n\nOn the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d\n\nTaking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d"

        "text": "Share on Pinterest What is decision fatigue, and how has this phenomenon evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Kayla Snell/Stocksy. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision fatigue happens when, after making many decisions at once, a person\u2019s ability to make decisions declines. Complex decisions, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, deplete one\u2019s capacity for decision making especially quickly. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32% of adults in the United States struggled to make basic decisions, such as what to wear, due to COVID-19-induced stress. Different age groups reported experiencing the phenomenon at different rates: 48% of millennials\n\n37% of Generation Z\n\n32% of Generation X\n\n14% of baby boomers\n\n3% of older adults These findings correspond with the survey\u2019s findings on stress levels. Younger groups were significantly more likely to report high stress levels than older groups. Parents with children under 18 years old were also disproportionately affected by stress compared with those without children. While 47% of these parents reported that day-to-day decisions were more stressful than before the pandemic, the same was true for 30% of those without children under 18 years old. People of Color have also been more affected by pandemic-related stress. According to the study, 38% of Hispanic adults and 36% of Black adults reported that pandemic-related stress impacted their decision making, compared with 29% of non-Hispanic White adults. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nHow the concept came to be Decision fatigue happens when a person becomes fatigued or exhausted from making too many decisions. It affects a person\u2019s ability to make further decisions, whether simple, such as deciding what to eat for dinner, or complex, such as determining whether or not to change jobs. The concept of decision fatigue originated in 1998. It centers on the idea that humans have a limited capacity to regulate their behavior. This means that after a certain point, people simply run out of energy to make decisions, much like a car running out of fuel once its petrol tank is empty. Running out of \u201cdecision making fuel\u201d is also known as ego depletion. Ego depletion changes the way we focus on and process information to make decisions, as well as our motivations. These motivational shifts can make a person more likely to make impulsive decisions that, under normal circumstances, they would not make. \u201cDoing repeated decision making [that] involves trade-offs between multiple competing values, such as risks and benefits\u201d increases a person\u2019s risk of experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g, an associate professor at Linkoping University in Sweden, told Medical News Today. \u201cCareful consideration of pros and cons in decision making is mentally taxing and may lead to decision fatigue when we feel stressed and mentally overloaded. This can lead people to shy away from engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning when tired and instead turn to decision\u2010making heuristics, that is, mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions on the basis of simple rules of thumb without engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g But decision fatigue does not just happen from making decisions. It can happen from any activity that demands the exertion of self-control. Dr. Grant A. Pignatiello, an instructor and clinical research scholar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told MNT that \u201c[d]ecision fatigue can manifest after repeated or effortful attempts of self-control.\u201d \u201cThe most common example is from making decisions. But it can also result from controlling your emotions, doing things that require cognitive effort, or intense physical exertion,\u201d he noted.\n\nSusceptibility Several factors are associated with a higher risk of decision fatigue, including: chronic exposure to stress and work complexity\n\nto stress and work complexity low knowledge and experience of independent decision making and a lack of direct managerial supervision\n\nand a lack of direct managerial supervision a high workload\n\na lack of time to make decisions Dr. Pignatiello said that everyone is susceptible to decision fatigue. However, the exact causes will differ from person to person: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the circumstances that lead to decision fatigue are unique for every person \u2014 for example, two individuals doing the same thing may experience different levels of decision fatigue. For a literal example, running a 5K may deplete your tank more than it would a person who runs every day.\u201d He added that the demands of modern everyday life, alongside modern work environments, necessitate complicated decisions that may make some more susceptible to decision fatigue than others.\n\nHow to spot decision fatigue Signs of decision fatigue include brain fog, feeling tired, and other signs of physical or mental fatigue. These may intensify the more decisions a person makes throughout the day. When asked how people may be able to spot whether or not they are experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Tingh\u00f6g said, \u201cIf there are drifts in the type of decision you are making throughout the day, without there being a logical explanation, this could be due to decision fatigue.\u201d \u201cBut also, it is possible to identify decision fatigue through introspection,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we feel that we don\u2019t have enough mental energy to make a thorough deliberation before an important decision, we are suffering from decision fatigue.\u201d Dr. Pignatiello also noted: \u201cIt requires some self-awareness for us to know when we may be in a state of decision fatigue. Some common signs include struggling with decisions that otherwise would not require much thought, e.g., \u2018What do I eat for dinner?\u2019 \u2018What should I wear?\u2019, feeling overwhelmed by our emotions, having a harder time remembering things or focusing, or simply just feeling more \u2018drained\u2019 than normal.\u201d"

        "title": "Long COVID's cardiovascular implications",
        "link": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/in-conversation-long-covids-cardiovascular-implications",
        "text": "Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 According to Dr. Fedorowski, \u201csomewhere between 1% and 10% of individuals [who contracted SARS-CoV-2] will develop all these [cardiovascular] complications, [such as] myocarditis, pericarditis, and even blood clots building in [the] arteries.\u201d The difficulty in treating these cases, moreover, is [because] the cardiovascular impact can be difficult to pinpoint at first. \u201cWe are talking about very small blood clots in very small arteries \u2014 they are not so easy to detect,\u201d said Dr. Fedorowski. \u201cBut some patients may report having blue fingers out of nowhere, just being infected a few days before. And this might be a sign of a very small, tiny blood clot in [the] peripheral blood arteries.\u201d The Nature Medicine study that we referred to earlier in the article shows that there is an increased risk of a whole range of cardiovascular outcomes even in those not admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 \u2014 that is, even in milder cases of the disease. To reach this conclusion, the study authors analyzed data from a large cohort of \u201c153,760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5,637,647 (contemporary controls) and 5,859,411 (historical controls) individuals.\u201d This ongoing risk of cardiovascular issues does not apply only to adults. According to a paper in Circulation in November 2020, children can also experience acute heart failure weeks after having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is likely to be an effect of long COVID in children, which is also under investigation. However, the syndrome that has most puzzled scientists regarding its association with long COVID is POTS.\n\nWhat is POTS, really? The medical community generally describes POTS, the syndrome that affects more and more people with long COVID, as a dysautonomic phenomenon \u2014 that is, something that affects the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the body\u2019s \u201cautopilot mode,\u201d which controls key bodily functions, such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion. POTS is one of several forms of dysautonomia, alongside neurocardiogenic syncope, which involves frequent fainting spells and multiple system atrophy, a rare and fatal condition that leads to rapid systemic deterioration. The symptoms of POTS are as numerous as they are varied, ranging from lightheadedness upon standing up from a seated position to tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate), shortness of breath, and digestive symptoms. This heterogeneity of symptoms can make POTS difficult to diagnose. Doctors often mistake it for an anxiety disorder , as symptoms such as a rapid heart rate and heart palpitations also occur in people who experience anxiety. \u201cThe problem with POTS is that it seems to be not only a cardiovascular problem \u2014 [a] heart and vessel problem \u2014 [but also] a problem of your nervous system, sometimes on your gastrointestinal system,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski explained. \u201cAnd in the end, we call it \u2018dysautonomia,\u2019 as it seems [to be] about your autonomic nervous system, which controls all your autonomic functions [\u2026]. And as the autonomic nervous system controls, first of all, your circulatory system, the main symptoms that you feel are from the circulatory or from your heart palpitations or blood pressure instability \u2014 you don\u2019t feel good when you stand up, and so on. But the problems are a little bit diffused,\u201d he noted, pointing out that even top specialists may find it hard to diagnose POTS correctly. Ms. Meriquez V\u00e1zquez described her experience of POTS as a life altering syndrome, and she confirmed the similarity between symptoms of POTS and those of a panic attack: \u201c[M]y POTS started as very severe adrenaline rushes along with a racing heart, especially when I was standing \u2014 I would get so nauseated and dizzy. From all of the adrenaline, it felt like a panic attack, but it would come out of nowhere.\u201d Why does adrenaline, or epinephrine, play a role? Dr. Kavi explained that \u201cthe sympathetic nervous system is the fight-or-flight system, and that\u2019s where the adrenaline [\u2026] \u2014 noradrenaline \u2014 comes in.\u201d \u201cThe parasympathetic system is the rest-and-digest system. And for us to function normally, we have to have a balance between the two \u2014 a sort of equilibrium. And it\u2019s when that equilibrium gets disrupted, and one or [the other] is overpowering that people develop problems,\u201d she explained.\n\nWhat causes POTS? The mechanisms behind POTS remain unclear, but ongoing research is searching for the likeliest explanations. A study published in February 2022 in Cells found that people with POTS have platelet storage pool deficiency, a phenomenon linked to symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds, dysmenorrhea, easy bruising, and anemia. It also showed that people with POTS have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, all of which may suggest a state of chronic inflammation. \u201c[T]he data provided [in this study] suggest that POTS is a mixed inflammatory pattern disease,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nPOTS before and after COVID-19 Although more and more media content has started looking at POTS as a long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections, POTS itself is not a newly emerged syndrome. According to data that the nonprofit organization Dysautonomia International cited well before the pandemic, an estimated 1\u20133 million people in the U.S. had POTS. Although it is unclear how many more people are seeking care in the aftermath of COVID-19 than they were pre-pandemic, anecdotal reports seem to indicate a steep increase in cases, most of them associated with long COVID. Dr. Fedorowski also told us that he and his colleagues at the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden have been seeing an influx of people with long COVID whom doctors have referred for POTS treatment: \u201cWe experience a huge inflow of new referrals from different parts of the region of Stockholm, meaning that in the Stockholm area, [where] we have around 2.5 million citizens, [\u2026] from [that] whole area, we are getting referrals from primary care doctors [and] from other specialists from other hospitals regarding people who developed what we call \u2018long COVID\u2019 or \u2018post-COVID syndrome.\u2019 The main reason they are sent to us is that [here] is quite [a] high clinical suspicion of POTS \u2014 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.\u201d According to Dr. Fedorowski, at almost 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of referrals for POTS rehabilitation \u201chas doubled or tripled.\u201d Dr. Chung made a similar observation about the Johns Hopkins POTS Program, saying that he and his colleagues \u201chave [had] at least twice or three times more referrals\u201d at their clinic since the start of the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic numbers. And Dr. Kavi told us that the situation is the same in the U.K.: \u201cHere, the feedback that I\u2019m getting from the clinicians that we work with \u2014 who run POTS services and secondary care [\u2026] \u2014 [is] that they\u2019re noticing a significant increase in their referrals. And, of course, that means that their waiting lists are getting longer as well.\u201d\n\nWho is at risk of POTS, and why? Current data indicate that the people who most commonly receive a diagnosis of POTS in long COVID are young females. However, both Dr. Fedorowski and Dr. Chung noted that there is a slight difference in the demographics of people presenting with POTS before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have POTS associated with long COVID. According to the researchers, pre-pandemic, most people with POTS tended to be in their teens or early 20s, while people with long-COVID-associated POTS tend to be in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Dr. Fedorowski speculated that the high levels of stress that women in these demographics often encounter, perhaps due to persistent issues of gender inequality in the home and workplace, may play a role. \u201cA lot of younger women [\u2026] get affected by POTS as a consequence of COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski told Medical News Today. \u201cAnd if you talk to them [\u2026], then you will see a picture of a woman who is working very hard, having [a] family, taking care of children, and trying to reach some higher position in [\u2026] society; or [there] are the women who are very much stressed by feeling that they are not good enough.\u201d During the pandemic, for instance, women have continued to bear the higher burden of child care and stay-at-home orders during the early stages have also disproportionately affected working women. Research has shown that chronic stress can have a very real physiological impact, leading to impaired immune system function and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. However, reflecting on the shift in POTS demographics outlined by Drs Chung and Fedorowski, Dr. Kavi wondered whether \u201cit\u2019s a real increase in older people having POTS [after COVID-19] or whether it\u2019s just not being picked up in younger people\u201d since POTS is often not given due consideration as a possible diagnosis. \u201cIn terms of pediatricians and [family doctors], for example, they often don\u2019t think about [POTS as a possible diagnosis], and then there\u2019s very little, almost nothing in the way of services for people in the U.K. with POTS that are under the age of 16, so I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s there and we\u2019re missing it or it\u2019s not [been] there [previously].\u201d \u2013 Dr. Lesley Kavi Ms V\u00e0zquez also wondered whether more people with long COVID are now receiving POTS diagnoses not because they have newly developed the syndrome after becoming ill with COVID-19, but because their existing POTS symptoms have worsened in the aftermath. In their online support group, she told us, people are \u201coften reflecting on how they may have had signs of autonomic dysfunction prior to getting sick [with COVID-19].\u201d Research on POTS conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic further indicates that the syndrome can be associated with various chronic conditions, including diabetes, sarcoidosis, and lupus, as well as with aggressive treatments, such as chemotherapy. There is also some suggestion that POTS can develop following a viral illness and that sometimes genetic factors may be at play. According to PoTS UK, the syndrome can have associations with inherited conditions, such as hypermobility spectrum disorder and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. POTS also has associations with mast cell activation disorder , which causes allergic symptoms."

Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nWhat were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity.\n\nThe role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem"

(Loss of taste from COVID is typically attributable to a loss of smell.)\n\nRespiratory symptoms involve possible damage to the lungs and include severe shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and chest pain.\n\nSystemic/inflammatory and abdominal symptoms include musculoskeletal pain, anemia, myalgias, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, and fatigue. For the study, researchers analyzed data for 336,652 individuals collected by ZOE\u2019s COVID Symptom Study. Of this group, 1,459 reported post-COVID symptoms defined as more than 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 infection. Dr. Jai Marathe of Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today, \u201cThis study definitely improves our understanding of post-COVID syndrome and more importantly, who might be at risk of prolonged illness and debility.\u201d \u201cPhysicians and patients,\u201d Dr. Marathe pointed out, \u201care both looking for answers regarding who is at risk for developing long COVID, how long symptoms will last, what will help resolve the symptoms, etc. While this study does not answer all these questions, it provides a strong framework to build on.\u201d The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, has been published on the pre-print server medRXiV.\n\nHow variants affect symptoms The researchers were also able to begin to identify the symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and with vaccinations. Dr. Liane S. Canas, corresponding author of the study and postdoctoral research associate at King\u2019s College London, told Medical News Today: \u201cOur results suggest that chest-related symptoms (respiratory cluster) in the U.K. population were more evident among unvaccinated patients infected by the initial form of the virus [referred to as the \u201cwild\u201d variant].\u201d \u201cDifferently,\u201d Dr. Canas continued, \u201cpatients with either the Alpha or Delta variants have shown a higher incidence of neurological symptoms, such as anosmia and brain fog.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, we could not robustly evaluate the effect of vaccination for these two variants. For Alpha, we didn\u2019t have enough individuals vaccinated at the time of infection. For Delta, we didn\u2019t have enough unvaccinated individuals at the time of infection who developed long COVID,\u201d she pointed out. Systemic/inflammatory and abdominal conditions were lightly associated with all variants.\n\nThe duration of symptoms \u201cOn average,\u201d said Dr. Canas, \u201cthe wild-type form of the virus has shown a longer prevalence of symptoms, 30 weeks when compared with Delta and Alpha at 24 and 25 weeks respectively.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d she noted, \u201csince we only analyzed data from individuals with illness for longer than 12 weeks, these results are less significant than the profiling of the clusters, and would require further research, which would also consider the effect of vaccination.\u201d \u201cThe findings of the study,\u201d said Dr. Marathe, \u201csuggest that individuals struggling with long COVID, who experience severe shortness of breath, hoarse voice, loss of smell, fatigue, delirium, anosmia, headache, and fever were more likely to [experience] prolonged and severe symptoms.\u201d \u201cPhysicians armed with this information,\u201d she said, \u201cmay be able to better counsel their patients and expectations for symptom improvement. They may also work towards targeted treatment approaches that address the symptom cluster impacting, and hopefully improving, clinical care for the patients.\u201d"

        "title": "Here, we cover 12 persistent myths surrounding IBD. Among other topics, we will discuss treatment, stress, personality, and symptoms beyond the gut.",
        "link": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-ibd",
        "text": "Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY.\n\n1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d\n\n2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD.\n\n4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\n\n5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d\n\n6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery.\n\n7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d\n\n8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d\n\n9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD.\n\n10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.\n\n11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure."

        "link": "https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-delta-aquarid-meteor-shower/",
        "text": "Every year, 2 meteor showers \u2013 the famous Perseids and the lesser known Delta Aquariids \u2013 converge in late summer. The Delta Aquariids always peak in late July. And the Perseids always peak around August 12 and 13. But \u2013 in 2022 \u2013 moonlight will interfere with Perseids\u2019 peak. So we recommend you to watch in late July and early August \u2013 on multiple nights \u2013 to catch meteors in these 2 grand showers.\n\nWhen to watch: Watch late July through early August, mid-evening to dawn. There\u2019s a nominal predicted* peak on July 29, 2022. But don\u2019t worry too much about that peak date. Delta Aquariid meteors fly for weeks!\n\nNearest moon phase: In 2022, new moon falls at 17:55 UTC on July 28. And full moon will fall at 1:36 UTC on August 12. Take advantage of the moon-free mornings in late July and early August for watching the Delta Aquariids (and the Perseids).\n\nRadiant: Rises in mid-evening, highest around 2 a.m. and low in the sky by dawn.\n\nDuration of shower: July 18 to August 21.\n\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: The Delta Aquariids\u2019 maximum hourly rate can reach 20 meteors in dark skies with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky. If you\u2019re watching in early August, you\u2019ll be adding that number to however many Perseids you see.\n\nNote: Like May\u2019s Eta Aquariids, July\u2019s Delta Aquariids favors the Southern Hemisphere. Skywatchers at high northern latitudes tend to discount it. But the shower can be excellent from latitudes like those in the southern U.S. Delta Aquariid meteors tend to be fainter than Perseid meteors. So a moon-free dark sky is essential. About 5% to 10% of the Delta Aquariid meteors leave persistent trains, glowing ionized gas trails that last a second or two after the meteor has passed.\n\nReport a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it\u2019s fun and easy!\n\nThe Delta Aquariid\u2019s parent comet\n\nFrom Don Machholz, who has discovered 12 comets \u2026\n\nThe Delta Aquariid meteor shower\u2019s parent comet comes from the 96P/Machholz Complex.\n\nThe 96P/Machholz Complex is a collection of eight meteor showers, including the Delta Aquariids, plus two comet groups (Marsden and Kracht), and at least one asteroid (2003 EH1). These meteors showers, and these comets, appear to share a common origin (although they\u2019ve now diverged slightly in their orbits around the sun).\n\nThey are all related to the comet known as 96P/Machholz, which I discovered on May 12, 1986, from Loma Prieta Mountain in California.\n\nAt discovery, the comet was magnitude 10 and two degrees south of the Andromeda galaxy. I was using my 6-inch homemade binoculars for this find. Read the story of the discovery.\n\nAs a matter of fact, scientists had suspected the existence of the 96P/Machholz Complex in 2003. Finally, they fully described it in 2005, after conducting more studies.\n\nComet 96P/Machholz orbits the sun every 5.3 years and gets eight times closer to the sun than we are. That is, its perihelion distance is 0.12 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. So this comet comes well inside the orbit of Mercury. Over the course of 4,000 years, the comet\u2019s orbit changes in shape and tilt, so that it leaves particles throughout the inner solar system. It gets around!\n\nA recent study suggests that the material causing the Delta Aquariid meteor shower left the comet\u2019s nucleus about 20,000 years ago. It\u2019s old dust streaking across our skies.\n\nPerseid? Or Delta Aquariid?\n\nPerseid and Delta Aquariid meteors fly in our skies at the same time of year. How can you tell them apart? This is where the concept of a radiant point comes in handy. If you trace all the Delta Aquariid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from a certain point in front of the constellation Aquarius, which, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, arcs across the southern sky.\n\nMeanwhile, the Perseids radiate from the constellation Perseus, in the northeast to high in the north between midnight and dawn as seen in Northern Hemisphere skies.\n\nSo \u2013 assuming you\u2019re in the Northern Hemisphere, and watching around midnight or after \u2013 if you\u2019re watching the Perseids and you see meteors coming from the northeast or north \u2026 they are Perseids. If you see them coming from the south \u2026 they are Delta Aquariids. In a particularly rich year for meteors, if you have a dark sky, you might even see them cross paths!\n\nConsequently, it can be an awesome display.\n\nDelta Aquariid meteor shower photos from the EarthSky community\n\nSubmit your night sky photos to EarthSky here\n\nBottom line: The nominal peak of the Delta Aquariid meteor shower is late July. But the shower rambles along steadily in late July and August, intermingling with the Perseids. In 2022, watch in late July and early August.\n\n*Predicted peak times and dates for 2022 meteor showers are from the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower peak times can vary.\n\nEverything you need to know: Perseid meteor shower"

        "text": "Jacqui Wise Kent\n\nThe largest study of confirmed monkeypox cases to date has identified new clinical symptoms that are similar to those of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections and could easily lead to misdiagnosis.1 These symptoms included single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anal mucosa.\n\nAn international collaboration across 16 countries reported 528 infections that were diagnosed between 27 April and 24 June 2022. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95% of these patients presented with a rash, 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions.\n\nA 10th of the patients (54) had only a single genital lesion. Another unexpected finding was that 15% had anal or rectal pain (or both).\n\nThe study authors said that the current case definitions for monkeypox should be expanded to help diagnosis and slow the spread of infection. Existing definitions do recommend consideration of monkeypox in the context of any \u201cunusual\u201d rash but do not cover the full range of possible manifestations.\n\n\u201cThe current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa, and single ulcers,\u201d said Chloe Orkin, professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London and director of the Sexual Health and HIV All East Research (SHARE) collaborative, which is based in east London and investigates the inequalities that lead to poor sexual health and HIV. Orkin added, \u201cThese particular symptoms can be severe and have led to hospital admissions, so it is important to make a diagnosis. Expanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognise the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.\u201d\n\nIn the case series, 98% of the people infected were gay or bisexual men, 75% were white, and 41% had HIV. Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), headache (27%), and lymphadenopathy (56%). Among the 23 patients with a clear exposure history the median incubation period was seven days (range 3-20).\n\nTransmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the cases. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 people in whom seminal fluid was analysed. However, this may be incidental, as it is not yet known whether it is present at high enough levels to facilitate sexual transmission.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stress that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense; it can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact,\u201d said study author John Thornhill, a consultant physician in sexual health and HIV and clinical senior lecturer at Barts NHS Health Trust and Queen Mary University of London. \u201cHowever, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity\u2014mainly, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men.\u201d\n\nMost of the cases reported in the series were mild and self-limited, and there were no deaths. The study also found that HIV infection was not linked to monkeypox severity. Although 13% of the patients were admitted to a hospital, no serious complications were reported in the majority of those admitted. Common reasons for admission were pain and bacterial superinfection. However, the study authors pointed out that rare serious complications, including myocarditis and epiglottitis, were observed and that therefore longer term follow-up of cases was needed.\n\nCommenting on the study, Claire Dewsnapp, president of the British Association for Sexual Health, said the UK government must be bold in acting against monkeypox. \u201cThese measures must include an effective vaccine procurement and delivery plan, a clearly accountable national response lead, and a national plan for testing, assessment, treatment, and prevention,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of 18 July 2022 there were 2137 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, 2050 of them in England. Almost three quarters (73%) of England\u2019s cases were in London.2\n\nIn response to the rising number of cases the UK Health Security Agency said that it had procured an additional 100 000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. Gay and bisexual men at high risk of exposure to monkeypox will be offered the vaccine.34\n\nOn 19 July the UK Health Security Agency also updated its guidance for close contacts of a confirmed monkeypox case.5 This said that close contacts won\u2019t need to isolate at home if they don\u2019t have symptoms, as the latest data showed that a relatively small number of close contacts had gone on to develop monkeypox and there was a lack of evidence of transmission outside close intimate or sexual contact."

This compared with only 8.7% (361/4130) of uninfected people followed over the same period.\n\nThe core long covid symptoms highlighted by the researchers include chest pain, difficulties breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and smell, tingling extremities, lump in throat, feeling hot and cold, heavy arms or legs, and general tiredness.\n\nThe questionnaire was sent out 24 times to the same people from March 2020 to August 2021. During this period people would have been infected with alpha or an earlier variant, and most people were unvaccinated.\n\nOver 76 000 participants completed a total of 883 973 questionnaires, the average age of respondents was 54, and 61% were female. A group of 4231 (5.5%) participants who had covid were then matched to 8462 controls who did not, taking into account sex, age, and the time of covid diagnosis.\n\nAranka Ballering, study author and a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, said, \u201cBy looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cPost-covid-19 condition is an urgent problem with a mounting human toll. Understanding the core symptoms and the prevalence of post-covid-19 in the general population represents a major step forward for our ability to design studies that can ultimately inform successful healthcare responses to the long term symptoms of covid-19.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledged some limitations to the study, including that it did not include an ethnically diverse population and that because of asymptomatic infection they may have underestimated the true prevalence of covid-19. Additionally, some symptoms that have been highlighted as potentially relevant to long covid, such as brain fog, were not considered during the study.\n\nThis article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "title": "Downplaying the catastrophic health impact of heatwaves costs lives",
        "link": "https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1940",
        "text": "Dann M Mitchell , professor of climate science , Y T Eunice Lo , fellow in climate and health Cabot Institute for the Environment, University of Bristol, UK\n\nThe UK recently well and truly surpassed its daytime and night time highest temperature records. A previous national daytime record of 38.7\u00b0C, set in 2019, was broken when temperatures rose above 40\u00b0C in the UK for the first time on 19 July and reached a new high of 40.3\u00b0C in Lincolnshire. That night, the previous overnight record of 23.9\u00b0C (recorded in 1990) was also broken, with the temperature provisionally hitting 25.8\u00b0C in Surrey.\n\nHeatwaves are often called \u201csilent killers,\u201d and are one of the clearest examples of an environmental hazard that leads to adverse health outcomes.\n\nOver the past two decades we have seen changes in individual heatwave characteristics that can be attributed to human induced climate change\u2014and in the past five years we have even detected an increase in excess mortality from heatwaves attributable to human activity. Attribution analysis is complex and time consuming, but a provisional rapid fire analysis by the World Weather Attribution has suggested that this event was made at least 10 times more likely by human induced climate change, although that number can change quite a bit depending on how the event is defined. It is therefore extremely likely that more excess deaths have occurred in this heatwave than would have without climate change.\n\nTypically, around 1000-2000 heatwave excess deaths occur during a UK summer, but extremely hot summers can see as many as 2500. An estimated 850 people lost their lives in England and Wales between 18 and 19 July, when the UK issued its first red warning for extreme heat since launching the warning system in 2021.\n\nWhen heatwaves become unprecedented, cascading impacts start to be very relevant. A clear example of negative physical and mental health outcomes from this heatwave were the fast paced and widespread wildfires.\n\nWildfires per se are not uncommon in the UK. A high risk of dangerous fire exists in around 10% of summers, but we expect the risk to more than double if we miss the upper goal set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. This goal sets out the ambition to limit global average warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and our planet is already at around 1.1\u00b0C above the baseline. Wildfires around London on 18 and 19 July meant that the capital\u2019s firefighters saw their busiest day since the second world war, and point toward areas of adaptation required to manage the effects of future climate change.\n\nWell informed and targeted information and advice from the government and the media, before and during heatwaves, are critical to keeping the community protected, and in helping to hammer home the importance of implementing climate policies to limit future climate change.\n\nSome recent media reporting has been excellent, alluding to the dangers of the heat and highlighting the role of climate change, but elsewhere misinformation, and denialism are rife. Some sections of the press downplayed, belittled, or attempted to counter the expert opinions of meteorologists and climate scientists, including launching personal attacks on them.\n\nNo one quite thought we would see the narrative of the satirical movie \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d played out in real life, but we did. A clip from the film, where an astronomer warns in a TV interview that a comet is hurtling towards that earth and will completely destroy it, and is told by the news anchor \u201cto keep the bad news light,\u201d went viral, with similarities drawn with the real life coverage of the heatwave. In reality, one news presenter said meteorologists were \u201charbingers of doom\u201d for stating that heatwaves lead to excess deaths. Meanwhile the editorial of a major UK newspaper said, \u201cListening to apocalyptic climate change pundits\u2026 you\u2019d think Britain was about to spontaneously combust\u201d on day one of the heatwave, then ran with the headline \u201cHottest UK day ever\u2026 nightmare of the wildfires\u201d the following day, seemingly unaware of the contradiction. We even saw a large anti-climate lobby group implying that the \u201cnightmare\u201d wildfires were caused by people pushing a pro-climate action agenda.\n\nMore and more we see how effective social media influencers can be in these types of communications, with this heatwave being one of the clearest examples. As with the traditional media, we saw some excellent reporting and advice from some of the well known science based authors and broadcasters, but we also heard the voices of disinformation and scepticism amplified through enhanced visibility from non-scientific creators with many thousands of followers, for example through tagging on Twitter.\n\nDownplaying, ignoring, or misreporting the catastrophic health impact of heatwaves costs lives. It costs lives at the time of the event, through giving the public an unrealistic view of the risk, and it costs lives in the longer term by hindering the climate change negotiation process.\n\nHeatwaves are only part of the global burden of climate change on health, but events like the 2022 UK record breaker act as a stark reminder for why urgent emission reductions are necessary. We have options available to us, what we need now is the national and international collaborative spirit to bring them to bear."

        "text": "We used data from a large cohort of people with covid-19 infection that occurred in December 2021 to examine the relative difference in covid-19 mortality between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants. Our study shows that the risk of covid-19 death was reduced by 66% after infection with the omicron BA.1 variant compared with the delta variant after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status and comorbidities. Importantly, we found that the relative risk of covid-19 death after omicron infection versus delta infection varied by age, with lower relative risk in younger people. The risk also varied by vaccination status, with the difference in covid-19 death between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants being lower for all vaccination statuses but less pronounced for people who had received two vaccinations.\n\nBecause the emergence of the omicron variant resulted in an increased rate of transmission, the number of people infected with the omicron variant in our sample increased considerably across the study period. To account for the difference in infection rate across the period, a cubic spline for calendar time was included in models 2-4. While the BA.2 subvariant of omicron does not have the spike gene deletion that causes SGTF, the UK only recorded an increase in the number of people with subvariant BA.2 in the week commencing 3 January 2022. 13 Our data include omicron compatible and delta compatible infections identified between 1 and 30 December 2021, which was a period when BA.1 was prominent and omicron could be identified from SGTF. These results provide clear evidence that in the UK the risk of covid-19 mortality after infection with omicron is considerably less than for delta.\n\nOur results extend these initial analyses quantifying the risk of omicron severity in terms of hospital admission to covid-19 mortality. Nyberg and colleagues 8 report a reduction in death after omicron infection (hazard ratio 0.31) compared with delta, which is similar to our findings. Importantly, our results account for more sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, and highlight that the reduction in risk remains consistent even after adjusting for these additional variables. Furthermore, our study specifically quantifies the risk of cause specific covid-19 mortality, using death registration data, unlike previous work which has defined covid-19 death as death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nEarly work exploring the clinical severity of the covid-19 omicron variant in a South African cohort found considerably reduced odds of hospital admission after SGTF versus non-SGTF infection across the same period. 7 A subsequent study in California on positive PCR tests between 30 November 2021 and 1 January 2022 also showed risk reductions for hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality after omicron infection compared with delta infection. 10 In Canada, in a matched sample, the risk of hospital admission or death was found to be 65% lower among those with the omicron variant than in people with the delta variant. 11 Emerging evidence has found that omicron replicates more readily in the upper airways than the lungs, potentially indicating a biological mechanism for the reduction in risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron compared with delta. 12\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study\n\nWe used a large sample of positive cases from the national testing programme, allowing us to estimate the relative risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron BA.1 and delta. By linking these infection data to information on vaccination status, comprehensive sociodemographic characteristics from the census and information on pre-existing conditions based on primary care and hospital data, we were able to estimate the relative difference in mortality between the omicron BA.1 and delta variants, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status with manufacturer type and key worker status. We also tested whether the relative mortality risk for omicron BA.1 versus delta depended on vaccination status and the number of comorbidities by including interactions between variant type and vaccination status (or comorbidities). This is an important result because we show that regardless of vaccination status omicron was milder than delta. However, no difference was found by number of comorbidities. To control for the prioritisation of the vaccination rollout, we adjusted for the interaction between vaccination status and age.\n\nWe used death certificate data to confirm covid-19 mortality, which prevented people who died from other causes after a positive covid-19 test being included in our sample. Additionally, it is important to note that the number of covid-19 deaths was low in people younger than 70 years of age, with 68.1% of events occurring in those aged \u226570. However, we had sufficient power to show important risk reductions in younger age groups, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders. We also compared the outcomes during the same time periods to minimise bias from management of patients with covid-19 in healthcare settings during the pandemic.\n\nOne study limitation is an ascertainment bias because the data do not cover all SARS-CoV-2 infections, but only a subset of people who tested positive as part of the national testing programme in the community and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Tests conducted in the community but processed by other laboratories and tests conducted in hospitals could not be used because they do not use the S gene molecular diagnostic assay, which we used to identify the variant type. A limitation of our work is not having access to data to determine covid-19 variants from tests in hospital (NHS pillar 1), which explains why our total sample is smaller than those used in other research.8 Differences in testing behaviours between groups could bias the estimates of risk of covid-19 death among people who tested positive. If some people only get tested if they experience severe symptoms, the estimated risk of death would be higher in this group than in people who get tested more routinely, even if the population has the same underlying risk. To mitigate this issue, we also adjusted the models for factors that might affect the propensity to get tested and might also be related to the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ethnicity, region, calendar date of infection, and key worker status. However, adjusting for these factors in models 3 and 4 had little effect on our overall estimates, suggesting that any selection effects according to these characteristics had smaller impacts than might be hypothesised. One explanation for this could be the restriction of our analysis to a short time period when both variants were circulating. Sociodemographic information was obtained from the 2011 census, which was the most up to date at the time of the study, however future validation work should be conducted when 2021 census data have been released and potentially using more breakdowns of variables, such as region.\n\nBecause of death registration delays, not all deaths that occurred in the period might have been registered at the time of the study. Deaths that occurred among people who tested positive in late December are less likely to have been registered than those that occurred in people who tested positive at the beginning of the month. As the proportion of omicron BA.1 infections increased during December, the delay in death registration, if unaccounted for, could lead to underestimation of the severity of the omicron BA.1 variant. However, we accounted for the effect of registration delay in December by adjusting for calendar time of infection in our models, reducing the difference between omicron BA.1 compared with delta as expected. To fully assess the impact of covid-19, additional outcome measures such as hospital admission need to be considered. Furthermore, if the data allow, symptom profiles could be used to predict outcomes to enable better management of healthcare requirements."

        "text": "Smell and taste disorders tended to be overlooked by clinicians before the covid-19 pandemic, possibly because these senses were considered as unessential for life compared with vision and hearing.50 As a result of the covid-19 pandemic, patients and doctors may now be aware that these are major problems that could adversely impact quality of life, personal-social functioning, mental health, general health, and safety, long after patients recover from covid-19.\n\nIn this meta-analysis of time-to-event data from 3699 patients in 18 studies, an estimated 74%, 86%, 90%, and 96% of patients self-reported smell recovery and 79%, 88%, 90%, and 98% self-reported taste recovery at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days, respectively. On the basis of parametric cure models, persistent smell or taste dysfunction might develop in about 5% of patients. Sensitivity analyses suggest this could be an underestimate. Female sex was associated with poorer recovery of both smell and taste, whereas greater initial severity of dysfunction and nasal congestion were associated with poorer smell recovery only.\n\nComparison with other studies\n\nThis study used comprehensive, flexible statistical modelling to estimate the recovery curves and the proportion of patients who develop persistent smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. We used statistical cure models to investigate recovery from smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19, and potentially our methods could be expanded to cover other major symptoms.\n\nOur recovery curves are consistent with the findings of recent studies, which suggest that recovery from smell and taste dysfunction mostly occurs early in the course of covid-19.751 More importantly, our cure models are consistent with other studies that explored the point prevalence of persistent dysfunction at long follow-up durations of six months to one year.22234952 We had excluded these studies as they did not provide appropriate graphs for reconstruction of IPD for this meta-analysis. These studies reported 9.0% of patients having little or no improvement in sense of smell at six months52; and 7.0-8.6% still had functional anosmia or persistent to worsening smell or taste impairment at one year,2249 which corresponds with our cure model predictions of 3-11% of patients who develop persistent dysfunction. This provides support for the external validity of our findings and suggests that these patients are less likely to experience recovery. Nonetheless, recovery even after many years remains possible, based on previous studies of post-viral olfactory loss53; thus patients with covid-19 should be followed-up over the long term.\n\nThe differential recovery rates could be explained by the underlying mechanisms of smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. Briefly, conductive barriers can prevent odorants and tastants from reaching receptors, and sensorineural interference can block sensory receptor function or signal transmission to the brain. Sensorineural mechanisms are currently thought to be the predominant mechanism of covid-19 related smell dysfunction,5455 although conductive mechanisms have been implicated too.56 SARS-CoV-2 infects and eliminates most olfactory epithelial support (sustentacular) cells that express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, which leads to olfactory neuron deciliation and necrosis.5557 Varying regeneration speed of support cells and sensory neurons, influenced by the degree of inflammation, could explain the delayed smell recovery. Stem cell damage and severe inflammation may also prolong smell dysfunction by slowing the regeneration of olfactory epithelial.57 For taste dysfunction, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the salivary glands could impair salivary flow, leading to \u201cconductive\u201d taste dysfunction.58 Viral binding with oral mucosal cells might trigger inflammation, abnormal cell turnover, and reduced tastebud sensitivity and thus sensorineural taste dysfunction,5859 which may have varying regeneration speed. As these hypotheses have not been explored in association with recovery rates, further mechanistic research is warranted among the different patient subpopulations with rapid recovery or persistent dysfunction.\n\nAlthough it is unsurprising that higher initial severity of smell dysfunction may prolong recovery, it is not clear why female sex is associated with poorer recovery and is notably consistent with previous reports of post-viral smell dysfunction disproportionately affecting women.60 One reason could be the better baseline olfaction and gustation in female participants,6162 which may result in greater sensitivity to changes and a larger subjective impairment. Biological explanations are also possible, as oestrogen upregulates the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, and the enzyme\u2019s gene is located on the X chromosome.63 These findings suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor\u2014the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 virus, may have higher expression in women, or may express heterodimers that alter virus binding,64 thus potentially enhancing viral invasion in women. Furthermore, immune related X linked genes are more activated in the immune cells of women.64 Although acute inflammation promotes olfactory epithelial regeneration, chronic inflammation is detrimental to recovery.6566 These factors could possibly account for the poorer observed recovery in women and should be investigated further. It is also unclear why recovery of taste occurs faster in Asian countries. One possibility is the ethnic differences between continents, which may affect smell or taste perception,67 as well as susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus.68 Alternatively, intercontinental genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 might influence biological mechanisms.168 As many of the included studies did not specify the ethnic distribution of participants, however, further research is required to explain this phenomenon.\n\nOur findings suggest an important burden from persistent smell and taste dysfunctions. Presently it is unknown if these sensory impairments might be associated with long term health related consequences. Smell dysfunction could predict the development of depression69 and is potentially associated with neurodegenerative disorders, often heralding neurological and cognitive manifestations by several years.70 Although recent studies of long covid have already reported a substantial burden of brain fog,71 anxiety, and depression,72 it remains uncertain if persistent smell dysfunction after covid-19 might prognosticate an increased risk of long term neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders.13 With more than 550 million people worldwide confirmed as having covid-19 as of July 2022, of whom about 50% report smell or taste dysfunction,2 just 5.6% and 4.4% of patients with persistent smell and taste dysfunction translates to more than 15 million and 12 million patients with long term smell and taste dysfunctions, respectively. These patients may require further investigation, longitudinal follow-up, and appropriate treatment.\n\nFinally, these findings should also be considered in the light of recent viral mutations. The omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is associated with a less noticeable reduction in loss of smell and taste compared with the delta and alpha variants.73 This has contributed to increasing difficulty in detecting omicron using a symptom based testing approach. In particular, one large study found that only 13-16% of patients lost their sense of smell and taste during the period when the omicron variant was dominant, compared with 44% when the delta variant dominated.73 This may be secondary to alterations in the omicron spike protein,74 which might result in less effective cell membrane fusion and olfactory host cell entry. Therefore, smell and taste recovery could also follow a different course after an omicron related infection. Although smell and taste dysfunction are less common with omicron, the fourfold transmissibility of omicron compared with the delta variant may still imply a net increase in the prevalence of chemosensory disorders.75 As we found no relevant studies in our systematic search that stratified recovery according to SARS-CoV-2 variant, this remains an important area of future research."

        "text": "There have been reports of the Zika virus being detected in the urine and saliva of two patients in Brazil. But experts in the UK have emphasised that the Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes and that it is found mainly in the blood. This means that avoiding mosquito bites is the most important way of preventing infection with the Zika virus. Although some of the virus may find its way into other body fluids, such as urine and saliva, this will be in such small amounts that the chance of any of the virus finding its way into the bloodstream of another person is extremely low, said the experts."

        "text": "Christopher Dye , professor of epidemiology , Moritz U G Kraemer , associate professor of computational and genomic epidemiology Department of Biology, University of Oxford, UK Correspondence to: C Dye christopher.dye{at}zoo.ox.ac.uk\n\nHere\u2019s what we know, and what we need to know\n\nBetween 4 and 25 May, 221 confirmed (by reverse transcriptase PCR) and 86 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 23 countries in Europe plus Argentina, Australia, Canada, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.1 Such a large number of cases has never previously been reported from so many countries outside Africa in just a few weeks. New cases are being reported daily; more can be expected and in more locations. Why the extraordinary surge now? What do we need to know to stop it?\n\nAlmost all patients so far are male (three are female) and presented with symptoms typical of monkeypox, including fever, vesicular rash, skin lesions and ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes.2 The first case in this outbreak was a man who visited Nigeria from the UK.3 He developed a rash on 29 April before leaving Nigeria, arriving back in the UK on 4 May. He was immediately isolated at a London hospital on the same day. His contacts on the flight to the UK, together with others in the community plus healthcare staff, are being followed for 21 days, considered the upper limit of the incubation period for monkeypox.4 By 24 May, none of these contacts had reported symptoms.\n\nAnother 70 confirmed cases have been reported in the UK (all in England except one in Scotland), in several different groups. There is evidently person-to-person transmission within groups but no known links between groups or with the first case in England. One group is a household of three; another is four men who identify as gay or bisexual and seem to have been infected in London.5 Other than the man who was the first case, none have recently visited, or are known to have contacts that visited, endemic areas of Africa.\n\nInformed response Against this background, at least six lines of investigation will help to develop national and global responses in the coming days and weeks. The first is to find out whether the exceptionally large number of exported infections is linked to the increased frequency of travel to and from endemic areas of Africa now that covid restrictions have been lifted. If it is, published travel schedules between countries will help to specify and then mitigate risk around the world. The second is to investigate whether and how the spread of monkeypox is being driven by a rise in case numbers at source in west and central Africa. The number of monkeypox cases increased in Africa between 1970-79 and 2010-19 following the demise of smallpox and the decline in smallpox vaccination, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).67 This rise has included major outbreaks, the largest of which affected 17 states of Nigeria in 2017-18.89 Thirdly, the main routes of transmission need to be re-examined. The 2017-18 Nigerian epidemic was caused by multiple introductions from animals (most likely rodents) to humans, plus limited and perhaps non-sustaining chains of transmission between people.81011 Now, however, waning immunity to smallpox and smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine could have magnified the risk of sustained transmission between people, within and beyond Africa.1213 The relative importance of different transmission routes could also have changed. Close contact is normally needed to acquire infection from skin lesions, body fluids, exhaled droplets, or contaminated clothing and bedding. The discovery of cases among gay and bisexual men, notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, points to sex as one among other forms of close contact, although monkeypox is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease. Fourthly, we need to reassess what proportion of infections cause severe or fatal disease. Historically, two different genomic clades of monkeypox virus have been described in west and central Africa.7 All cases so far genotyped in Europe during the current outbreak are more closely related to the west African clade and to viruses exported from Nigeria to Israel, Singapore, and the UK in 2018 and 2019.1415 The west African clade has been associated with milder illness and a lower case fatality rate (roughly 4%) than the central African clade (roughly 10%).7 If some infections are asymptomatic, as previously described,11 these estimates of case fatality could be too high. Asymptomatic cases might also be missing links in transmission chains. Case fatality, and the risk of severe disease, can be reduced with some antivirals effective against poxviruses, but there is undoubtedly more to be learnt about supportive and therapeutic clinical care.16 The fifth line of investigation is to determine whether monkeypox could evolve, or has recently evolved, to become more pathogenic or more transmissible, or transmissible in a different way. Monkeypox virus is genetically variable and adaptable. The two main African clades consist of multiple lineages and many variants within each lineage. One genetic deletion identified in samples from DRC has been associated with human-to-human transmission.17 Clinical, epidemiological, and genomic surveillance is vital to detect possible changes in mode of transmission, human susceptibility, infectiousness, and pathogenicity.1518 Lastly in this short list, the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting individuals and populations should be further evaluated. Because smallpox is caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to monkeypox, pre-exposure inoculation with vaccinia vaccine is efficacious (about 85%) against monkeypox disease and probably also reduces onward transmission.19 Post-exposure inoculation gives less protection, so vaccine effectiveness in practice\u2014assessed, for example, while tracing and vaccinating contacts of cases20\u2014will depend on what proportion of people at risk can be immunised before rather than after acquiring infection. On present evidence, monkeypox is unlikely to become a global health emergency. Nevertheless, vigilance and open minded investigation are needed worldwide because until these and other questions are answered, we will not know how best to contain the unprecedented spread of this disease.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

        "link": "https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1659",
        "text": "Melina Zachariou The BMJ\n\nMonkeypox symptoms seen in patients attending four sexual health clinics in London appear to differ from those seen in previous outbreaks in Nigeria, Sudan, and the US, a study has found.1\n\nResearchers from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College London looked at the 54 cases diagnosed during a 12 day period in May 2022. They found that patients had a lower prevalence of tiredness and fever than seen in previously studied outbreaks. Skin lesions on genitals also appeared to be more common in this outbreak, while lesions on the face were less frequently seen.\n\nStudy co-author Ruth Byrne from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said, \u201cIt is possible that at various stages of the infection monkeypox may mimic common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as herpes and syphilis, in its presentation. It\u2019s important that sexual health clinicians and patients are aware of the symptoms of monkeypox as misdiagnosis of the infection may prevent the opportunity for appropriate intervention and prevention of onward transmission. Additional resources are urgently required to support services in managing this condition.\u201d\n\nAs of 30 June, the total number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 1235.2\n\nThe paper, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that patients were all symptomatic and presented with skin lesions. A total of 49 (94%) had at least one skin lesion on the genital or perianal skin, and around nine out of 10 (37, 89%) had skin lesions affecting more than one anatomical site. Just over half of patients (30, 55%) had lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes), while one in four patients had a concurrent STI.\n\nPatients mostly experienced a mild illness and recovered while isolating at home, however five people required hospital admission because of pain or infection of the skin lesions. All improved and were discharged, with an average of seven days spent in hospital.\n\nAll patients included in the study identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The median age was 41 years and 70% (38 of 54) were white. All except two patients were not aware of having been in contact with a known case and none reported travel to sub-Saharan Africa, although many had recently visited other European countries.\n\nComparison with previous outbreaks The researchers found the prevalence of fatigue, asthenia, or lethargy among patients (67%, 95% confidence interval, 54 to 79) was much lower than seen in previous outbreaks in Nigeria and the US (over 80%). Fewer patients also reported fever or febrile chills (57%, 95% CI 44 to 71), compared with outbreaks in Nigeria, Sudan, and the US (85% to 100%). Skin lesions on the genital or perianal skin were more frequently seen in patients included in this study (94%), compared with two thirds in previous outbreaks, while the prevalence of lesions on the face and neck was much lower in this study, at around one fifth compared with 62% to 97% previously. But, commenting on the paper, Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, Atlanta, said the findings were consistent with the new cases now being reported around the world. She said, \u201cThe findings are similar to those reported in cohorts from EU countries and the US. One in four people in this cohort had a concurrent STI which may reflect the study being conducted in sexual health clinics but could also reflect the overlap between how monkeypox is presenting in the ongoing outbreak and common STIs. It highlights the need to clarify the mechanisms of transmission in the current outbreak better to inform policies and approaches to contain it.\u201d The authors noted that their data was subject to selection biases as current guidance and health promotion materials are focused on promoting monkeypox testing in symptomatic people who self-define as MSM. They have stressed that it is important to remain alert to the possibility of spread to other groups while still balancing targeted health promotion to groups disproportionately affected by the current outbreak."

        "link": "https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-071249",
        "text": "Results 1 951 866 and 3 219 349 eligible adults received two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, and 2 422 980 remained unvaccinated. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be similar across outcomes and vaccine brands. In the \u226565 years subgroup, ratios of adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.24) to 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) per four weeks. Despite waning vaccine effectiveness, rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death were substantially lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated adults up to 26 weeks after the second dose, with estimated vaccine effectiveness \u226580% for BNT162b2, and \u226575% for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in vaccinated people were similar to or higher than in unvaccinated people (adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) for BNT162b2 and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) for ChAdOx1).\n\nWe did a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY-TPP database ( https://opensafely.org ), which includes detailed linked data on 24 million people (approximately 44% of the English population) registered with an English general practice using The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) SystmOne electronic health record software. We compared rates of covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related and non-covid-19 related mortality, and infection with SARS-CoV-2, between adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) vaccine and those who were unvaccinated.\n\nExamination of waning of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness is difficult. The success of vaccine rollouts in many countries means that only a small and selected proportion of the population remains unvaccinated and uninfected. Continuing uptake of vaccination, as well as ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2, further depletes this group over time. Vaccines were offered in priority order determined by age and clinical vulnerability, so that the longest follow-up is in people at the highest risk of severe covid-19. Rapid changes in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, related to pandemic control measures and introduction of new variants, make accounting for the calendar date on which events occurred essential. Many studies of waning covid-19 vaccine effectiveness have used \u201ctest negative case-control\u201d designs, restricted to people tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and comparing those testing positive (cases) and negative (controls) 5 9 17 18 or reported indirect evidence such as changing rates of covid-19 with time since vaccination. 11 12 The extent to which test negative case-control designs control bias due to confounding, or are biased because of the restriction to people who were tested, remains unclear. 19 20\n\nThe effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines, first shown in randomised trials, 1 2 has been confirmed with longer follow-up in observational studies. 3 4 5 However, neutralising antibody titres decrease with time since vaccination, 6 7 8 and vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time. 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The extent of waning of vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 is less clear: studies have found no evidence of waning, 9 10 17 modest waning, 5 11 or substantial waning. 12 Clarification of rates of waning effectiveness is needed to determine the frequency with which booster doses are needed and whether booster vaccination should be targeted at groups defined by age, clinical vulnerability, or brand of primary vaccine.\n\nPublic contributors were not involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No public contributors were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Covid-19 vaccination is offered to the whole population, including the researchers involved in the study. The main barriers to involving external public contributors were the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, which means that evidence quickly becomes outdated, and the urgent need to conduct and disseminate the research. OpenSAFELY invites any patient or member of the public to make contact with the project via https://opensafely.org/ .\n\nWe did all analyses independently in four vaccine priority subgroups: aged \u226565 years and in JCVI groups 2-5, aged 18-64 years and clinically vulnerable (JCVI groups 4 or 6), aged 40-64 years (JCVI groups 7-10; most people in this subgroup received ChAdOx1), and aged 18-39 years (JCVI groups 11-12; this subgroup received only BNT162b2). The \u226565 subgroup included participants who were clinically vulnerable, whereas the 40-64 and 18-39 subgroups did not. We fitted additional models separately in men and women to investigate effect modification by sex and in 65-74 and \u226575 years subgroups to investigate effect modification by age in older adults.\n\nWe used meta-regression to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of hazard ratios per comparison period. The ratios of hazard ratios can be interpreted as follows: if the hazard ratio in the three to six week comparison period is 0.5 and the ratio of hazard ratios is 1.2, then the hazard ratios will be 0.6 (=0.5\u00d71.2), 0.72 (=0.5\u00d71.2 2 ), 0.86 (=0.5\u00d71.2 3 ), 1.04 (=0.5\u00d71.2 4 ), and 1.24 (0.5\u00d71.2 5 ) in the 7-10, 11-14, 15-18, 19-22, and 23-26 week comparison periods respectively.\n\nTo estimate hazard ratios, we fitted Cox regression models with baseline hazards stratified by JCVI group, eligibility date, and region used to define the second vaccination periods, and with the covariates described above. To avoid problems with model convergence, we excluded binary covariates from the model if any cell of the table defined by cross tabulating the covariate with vaccine group and comparison period contained fewer than three events. For categorical covariates with more than two levels, levels were merged until either all levels had more than three events or only one level existed, in which case the variable was excluded. We carried out this process independently for each outcome. We modelled age within strata as linear, with quadratic terms additionally included for strata with age range >5 years.\n\nFor each comparison period, we estimated hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients versus unvaccinated people, ChAdOx1 recipients versus unvaccinated people, and BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 recipients. We did not estimate hazard ratios for comparison periods with fewer than three events in either group. For each person, follow-up ended at the earliest of the outcome of interest, deregistration from the primary care practice, death, or 15 December 2021. However, for SARS-CoV-2 test, follow-up ended at the \u201coutcome of interest\u201d only when the test result was positive. Fully vaccinated people who received a booster dose, and unvaccinated people who received a first dose were excluded from subsequent comparison periods, but follow-up within comparison periods was not censored after these events.\n\nModels were adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, sex (male or female), English Index of Multiple Deprivation (grouped by fifths), ethnicity (black, mixed, South Asian, white, other, as per the UK census), body mass index, learning disability, serious mental illness, number of comorbid conditions in different organ systems (supplementary table S3), current pregnancy, number of SARS-CoV-2 tests between 18 May 2020 (when widespread testing became available) and eligibility for first vaccine dose, and receipt of one or more flu vaccines in the five years before the start of the second vaccination period.\n\nThe outcomes were covid-19 related hospital admission (identified using Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient hospital records), covid-19 related death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-covid-19 related death. We also investigated test seeking behaviour by comparing rates of testing for SARS-CoV-2 between the vaccine groups. Covid-19 and non-covid-19 related deaths (death certificates with and without a covid-19 code) were based on death registry data from the Office for National Statistics. We identified SARS-CoV-2 tests by using SGSS records, on the basis of swab date. Both polymerase chain reaction and lateral flow tests were included, without differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We defined all outcomes by the date of their first occurrence during the comparison follow-up period. Where no positive SARS-CoV-2 test was present, but a record of covid-19 related hospital admission and/or death was recorded, we imputed the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test as the date of covid-19 related hospital admission or death.\n\nWe followed up unvaccinated people for the full eight calendar weeks that spanned the comparison periods for vaccinated people. To avoid overlap in follow-up of unvaccinated people between comparison periods (see lines corresponding to unvaccinated individuals E-L in figure 1 ), follow-up time for unvaccinated people was assigned at random to start either two or six weeks after the start of the second vaccination period and was split into the three consecutive eight week calendar periods during which vaccinated people were followed in each comparison period. Unvaccinated people assigned to start at two weeks were followed during comparison periods 1, 3, and 5, and those assigned to start at six weeks were followed during comparison periods 2, 4, and 6.\n\nIllustrative example showing definition of four week comparison periods, within strata defined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation group, eligibility date, and region. Horizontal lines represent follow-up time for four vaccinated and eight unvaccinated people, and colours of lines correspond to six comparison periods. Individuals A and D received their second vaccinations on first and last day of second vaccination period (SVP), respectively\n\nFigure 1 depicts the study design. The analysis timescale was calendar time, which ensured that vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared on the calendar day on which each outcome event occurred. We split follow-up time for fully vaccinated people into six consecutive four week \u201ccomparison periods,\u201d starting two weeks after receipt of the second dose. Because each second vaccination period was four weeks long and each vaccinated person was followed up for four weeks per comparison period, vaccinated people were followed during eight calendar weeks in each comparison period. Vaccinated people entered and finished follow-up on the calendar dates corresponding to the start and end of their comparison period.\n\nWe defined the second vaccination period as the four week period during which the greatest number of people in the stratum received their second dose. We excluded people from the vaccine groups if they received their first dose before their eligibility date, had an interval between first and second dose of less than six or more than 14 weeks, or were flagged as a healthcare worker on their vaccination record. We assigned people to the unvaccinated group if they had received no covid-19 vaccine at the start of the second vaccination period for their analysis stratum. We excluded people from any group if they had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by the start of their second vaccination period (either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in SGSS or probable covid-19 coded in primary care records), had ever been recorded as being resident in a care home, or had evidence of having started an end-of-life care pathway.\n\nWe defined three groups who received two doses of BNT162b2, received two doses of ChAdOx1, or were unvaccinated. Eligibility for the vaccinated groups was restricted to people who received their second vaccine dose during a four week \u201csecond vaccination period\u201d within analysis strata defined by UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority groups (supplementary table S1), eligibility date (for priority groups within which eligibility was based on age; supplementary table S2), and English NHS region (defined using individuals\u2019 primary care practice address).\n\nThis study was approved by NHS England. People were eligible for inclusion if they were aged \u226518 years on 1 July 2021 and had been registered with a primary care doctor for at least one year before eligibility for their first vaccine dose (the \u201celigibility date,\u201d supplementary table S2). People were excluded if they were aged >120 years on the date at which they became eligible for vaccination; their sex, geographical region, ethnicity, or English Index of Multiple Deprivation were unknown; or they were resident in a care home or medically housebound at six weeks after their eligibility date. Full details are in supplementary figure S1.\n\nWe observed no consistent differences between vaccine effectiveness in men and women. For ChAdOx1, adjusted hazard ratios seemed to be broadly similar in men and women. For BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 related hospital admission seemed to be somewhat greater in women than in men in the \u226565 subgroup but greater in men than in women in the 18-39 subgroup (supplementary tables S51-58; supplementary figures S32-35).\n\nEstimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 recipients consistently favoured BNT162b2 ( fig 3 ; supplementary table S7; ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in supplementary table S8). In the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios were 0.51 (0.33 to 0.79) and 0.36 (0.23 to 0.55), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission during weeks seven to 10; 0.58 (0.36 to 0.94) and 0.49 (0.20 to 1.18), respectively, for covid-19 related death during weeks 15-18; and 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88) and 0.35 (0.29 to 0.41), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks three to six. Because the rate of waning was slightly higher for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, the adjusted hazard ratios for both the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups were attenuated by weeks 23-26, but they still favoured BNT162b2 over ChAdOx1 (0.69 (0.61 to 0.78) and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.57), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission; 0.65 (0.48 to 0.86) and 0.54 (0.28 to 1.05), respectively, for covid-19 related death; and 0.75 (0.72 to 0.78) and 0.70 (0.67 to 0.72), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test).\n\nWe observed 1 406 181, 2 907 849, and 674 534 SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (only the first test in each comparison period counted; supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, rates of testing during weeks three to six were higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61) to 2.09 (2.03 to 2.15) for BNT162b2 and from 2.01 (1.95 to 2.08) to 2.79 (2.75 to 2.83) for ChAdOx1 (supplementary figure S30; supplementary tables S7 and S8). The discrepancy in testing behaviour between the vaccinated and unvaccinated people increased slightly by weeks 23-26; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 2.06 (2.00 to 2.13) to 3.06 (2.66 to 3.53) for BNT162b2 and from 2.31 (2.27 to 2.36) to 3.70 (3.64 to 3.76) for ChAdOx1.\n\nWe observed 8463, 9135, and 3031 non-covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios during weeks three to six ranged from 0.29 (0.24 to 0.35) to 0.47 (0.34 to 0.64) for BNT162b2 and from 0.29 (0.20 to 0.44) to 0.36 (0.30 to 0.44) for ChAdOx1 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). By weeks 23-26, these ranged from 0.55 (0.40 to 0.76) to 0.58 (0.48 to 0.69) for BNT162b2 and from 0.64 (0.43 to 0.95) to 0.74 (0.61 to 0.90) for ChAdOx1. Rates of waning were lower than for the other outcomes (maximum ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.19 (1.09 to 1.31); supplementary table S8).\n\nWe observed 62 363, 186 137, and 118 216 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). For BNT162b2 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios across subgroups ranged from 0.19 (0.13 to 0.27) to 0.27 (0.23 to 0.31) during weeks three to six and from 0.87 (0.78-0.97) to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). For ChAdOx1 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios ranged across subgroups from 0.43 (0.32 to 0.58) to 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81) and waned to 1.23 (1.11 to 1.36), 1.35 (1.29 to 1.41), and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively. For BNT162b2, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.29 (1.23 to 1.35), 1.30 (1.23 to 1.36), 1.32 (1.17 to 1.49), and 1.54 (1.50 to 1.59) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups, respectively (supplementary table S8). For ChAdOx1, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24), 1.14 (1.11 to 1.17), and 1.20 (1.16 to 1.25) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively.\n\nWe observed 329, 595, and 889 covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). In the \u226565 subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks three to six after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.12 (0.08 to 0.17) and 0.15 (0.11 to 0.21) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.31 (1.07 to 1.61) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. In the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks 15-18 after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.16) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.08 (0.04 to 0.18) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.20) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.38 (0.77 to 2.47) and 1.21 (0.99 to 1.49) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks 11-14 to 0.10 (0.04 to 0.22) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.66 (1.08 to 2.55) per period). Too few covid-19 related deaths occurred in the 18-39 subgroup to allow estimation of hazard ratios.\n\nWe observed 2100, 5369, and 9443 covid-19 related hospital admissions in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the \u226565 subgroup were 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.13) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.23), respectively, during weeks three to six after the second dose, waning to 0.20 (0.17 to 0.25) and 0.25 (0.21 to 0.29), respectively, during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were similar for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1: 1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40), respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.12) and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.14), respectively, during weeks three to six, waning to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.12) and 0.23 (0.19 to 0.26), respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35) and 1.20 (1.14 to 1.27) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.12 (0.10 to 0.15) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.24 (1.16 to 1.33) per period). Adjusted hazard ratios for BNT162b2 could not be estimated in the 40-64 subgroup because too few covid-19 related hospital admissions occurred. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-39 subgroup waned from 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.18 (0.10 to 0.29) during weeks 19-22 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.31 (1.10 to 1.57) per period).\n\nFigure 2 shows adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccination versus no vaccination across the six comparison periods. The slopes of the lines correspond to ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per comparison period (also shown in supplementary table S8). The missing adjusted hazard ratios could not be estimated because too few events occurred in one or both groups (supplementary table S5).\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios are shown in supplementary tables S6 and S7, respectively, and compared in supplementary figures S24-29, with adjusted hazard ratios for each covariate shown in supplementary tables S9-50. For the models comparing people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated people, the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were generally similar. Where they differed, patterns were outcome and subgroup specific. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were similar for comparisons of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1.\n\nSupplementary figures S20-23 show the distribution of follow-up by calendar time in each comparison period, for each subgroup, relative to dates during which different variants were dominant. Follow-up in the \u226565 subgroup began on 15 March 2021 (when the alpha variant was dominant) and ended on 30 November 2021. Follow-up for the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups began on 21 April, 18 May, and 23 July 2021, respectively: the delta variant was dominant in England by 1 June 2021. The latest follow-up was on 15 December 2021; 54% of specimens sampled in England on this date had S-gene target failure, which suggests that the omicron variant became dominant in England by this date. 24\n\nThe cumulative incidence of first vaccine dose by week 23 in previously unvaccinated people was 16%, 28%, 13%, and 14% in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups respectively (supplementary figure S19). The UK vaccination programme initially offered third doses only after six months (23-26 weeks) since the second dose 21 ; however, among the 18-39 subgroup, 35% and 26% of those in the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups, respectively, had received a third dose by week 20, because the required time since second dose was reduced to three months in early December 2021 owing to concerns about the omicron variant. 22 23\n\nOf 13 841 107 people satisfying initial eligibility criteria (supplementary figure S2), 5 222 812 received second doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 during the second vaccination period for their stratum (supplementary figures S3-18) and 2 575 111 were unvaccinated at the start of their second vaccination period. Of these, 1 951 866, 3 219 349, and 2 422 980 were eligible for inclusion in the first comparison period for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and unvaccinated groups, respectively. Table 1 and supplementary table S4 show summary statistics for these three groups by subgroup. Compared with vaccinated people, unvaccinated people were less likely to be white, to live in a more affluent area, to have had a flu vaccine in the previous five years, or to have tested for SARS-CoV-2 before their eligibility date. The distribution of other characteristics between vaccine groups differed according to subgroup. For example, in the \u226565 subgroup, those vaccinated with BNT162b2 were older than those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (75 (interquartile range 72-80) years) versus 72 (70-75) years, whereas the converse was true in the 40-64 subgroup (44 (41-50) years versus 55 (50-59) years).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis cohort study estimated the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccines during six consecutive periods, each of four weeks\u2019 duration, starting two weeks after receipt of second dose. Rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death were consistently and substantially lower among fully vaccinated people compared with those who remained unvaccinated, up to 26 weeks after the second vaccination, and consistently lower among people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 than with ChAdOx1. However, by 23-26 weeks, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test (ascertained through freely available national routine testing) in fully vaccinated people were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated people. Rates of non-covid-19 related death were consistently lower among fully vaccinated than unvaccinated people.\n\nWhen quantified as ratios of adjusted hazard ratios, estimated waning of vaccine effectiveness was strikingly similar across risk groups, except that waning was fastest in the 18-39 year subgroup (those at lowest risk of severe covid-19, all vaccinated with BNT162b2). In those subgroups in which the two vaccines could be compared, estimated vaccine effectiveness was consistently greater for BNT162b2 than for ChAdOx1, but waning was somewhat faster for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, so that the two brands\u2019 comparative effectiveness became more similar over time. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death remained \u22640.20 (\u226580% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2 and \u22640.25 (\u226575% vaccine effectiveness) for ChAdOx1 during weeks 23-26 after the second vaccination.\n\nFindings in context A systematic review and meta-regression of the duration of effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines included 18 studies, most of which evaluated BNT162b2 or Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 vaccine.13 Estimates of vaccine effectiveness and the duration of vaccine effectiveness varied substantially between studies. Only two studies found minimal vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection by six months, and none found decreases in vaccine effectiveness against positive SARS-CoV-2 test as large as those reported in our study.914 The meta-regression estimated an average decrease in vaccine effectiveness from one to six months after full vaccination across studies of 9.5 (95% confidence interval 5.7 to 14.6) percentage points for severe covid-19 (hospital admission or death due to covid-19), and of 20.7 (10.2 to 36.6) percentage points for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The corresponding reductions in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were: covid-19 related hospital admission 12.8 (7.41 to 18.2) for BNT162b2 and 11.7 (3.44 to 20.0) for ChAdOx1; positive SARS-CoV-2 test 68.2 (56.4 to 80.0) for BNT162b2 and 79.6 (62.0 to 97.2) for ChAdOx1. However, the ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were similar for covid-19 related hospital admission (1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) for BNT162b2 and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40) for ChAdOx1) and for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1.29 (1.23 to 1.35) for BNT162b2 and 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24) for ChAdOx1). Thus, the metric used to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness can lead to strikingly different conclusions about its magnitude. The review concluded that the decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 was less than for SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease. However, by quantifying waning in terms of ratios of hazard ratios, we found that rates of waning were similar for these two outcomes (supplementary table S8). As in our study, Andrews and colleagues analysed NHS England electronic health records data to investigate the duration of protection by covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic and severe covid-19.5 They used a test negative case-control design, which aims to reduce confounding due to health seeking behaviour by considering only people who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.25 However, this restriction to the subpopulation of people who are tested if they have symptoms has potential biases. For example, if older people were more likely to seek testing when they had symptoms then vaccine effectiveness in the tested subpopulation may differ from that in the general population.20 The restriction to those tested can also induce so-called \u201ccollider bias,\u201d because associations between causes of being tested are distorted in the tested subpopulation.26 Comparisons between this study and that of Andrews and colleagues are restricted to the \u226565 and 40-64 subgroups, as these are identically defined in the two studies, and to the 15-18 weeks comparison period in this study and the 15-19 weeks since second dose in the other study, which were the most similar across the two studies. Compared with Andrews and colleagues, we consistently estimated lower effectiveness for both vaccines against covid-19 related hospital admission (differences ranged from 1.3 to 6.4 percentage points). Andrews and colleagues concluded (by contrast with our study) that waning was greater for ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 and greater among older adults and those in a clinical risk group. Whereas those authors found continuing vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 up to 26 weeks after receipt of the second vaccine dose, we found rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to be similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated participants by that time. Most of the follow-up in our study was while the delta variant was dominant in England. Previous studies found vaccine effectiveness to be lower for the delta variant than the alpha variant,31827 and lower for the omicron variant than the delta variant.2829 Consistent with the findings of this study, infection in vaccinated people has been widespread since the omicron variant became dominant; an estimated 71% of people in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 22 April 2022.30 It will be important to extend the analyses reported in this study to examine longer term effectiveness of two dose vaccination, and waning effectiveness of booster vaccination, against the omicron variant.\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study Our study is based on whole population data analysed within the OpenSAFELY Trusted Research Environment, which has stringent disclosure controls to protect patients\u2019 privacy. The large study size and large numbers of outcome events led to precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness according to brand of vaccine and time since second vaccine dose. We accounted for risk dependent vaccine allocation by separating the cohort into subgroups based on JCVI group,31 and by doing analyses within strata defined by JCVI group, eligibility date for primary vaccination, and geographical region. We fully accounted for rapid changes in incidence of covid-19 with calendar time, because the risk sets underpinning the Cox models compared people being followed on the calendar day when outcome events occurred. Our analyses also excluded people with a pre-vaccine rollout record of SARS-CoV-2 infection and accounted for censoring due to occurrence of outcome events and attenuation of comparison groups because of receipt of first vaccine dose by unvaccinated people and third dose by fully vaccinated people. The OpenSAFELY platform contains an unprecedented scale of NHS records that are refreshed every week, and the methods used for data storage and management facilitate rapid re-execution of all curation and analysis code. This will enable us to regularly reassess waning vaccine effectiveness over extended time intervals, the impact of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the effects of further doses of covid-19 vaccines. Our study has several limitations. Firstly, as in any observational study, our estimates could be affected by confounding by unmeasured factors. The detailed linked data analysed permitted adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, but we may not have been able to control completely for the associations of being vaccinated with health seeking behaviours and being less socioeconomically deprived. Secondly, patients registered with a primary care practice who have moved or emigrated (or whose death was not recorded)32 may contribute person time but not events. Because the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups are defined by recent vaccination, these \u201cghost\u201d patients are more likely to be present in the unvaccinated group, leading to bias in estimates of waning. Also, healthcare workers could be identified and excluded from the vaccinated groups, because this information was recorded at the time of vaccination, but not from the unvaccinated group. This limitation should not affect results for the \u226565 subgroup, most of whom are retired, or comparisons between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. Thirdly, consistent with an Australian survey,33 we found that unvaccinated people had tested less frequently than vaccinated people during the pre-vaccine rollout period when widespread testing was available (table 1) and were considerably less likely to be tested during follow-up (supplementary table S7). Fourthly, differential depletion of susceptible people in the unvaccinated groups over time may lead to attenuation of hazard ratios even when true vaccine effectiveness does not change. However, such bias is likely to be minimal when vaccine effectiveness is high.34 Fifthly, we excluded people vaccinated outside defined \u201csecond vaccination periods\u201d and estimated hazard ratios within four week periods subsequent to second vaccination. Modelling non-linear interactions of vaccine effectiveness with time since vaccination is a potentially more powerful approach that could avoid excluding so many people but would rely on more complex modelling assumptions than those underpinning our analyses."

        "text": "Trisha Greenhalgh , professor 1, Binita Kane , consultant respiratory physician 2, Stephen Reicher , professor 3 1Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford 2Manchester University Foundation Trust, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester 3School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St. Andrews\n\nIn May 2022, the UK Health Security Agency changed its guidance to make masking in healthcare settings a provider decision dependent on local risk assessment and prevalence.1 Local masking policies vary widely, but anecdotal reports indicate that some issue all visitors with a single-use disposable paper mask on arrival and ask them to replace the mask they are currently wearing with it. A request for examples on Twitter quickly drew dozens of responses including from immunosuppressed people who had attended for chemotherapy or scans and had been asked to remove their high-filtration FFP2 or FFP3 respirator and replace it with a single-use disposable mask as a condition of entry.2 In some, but not all, examples, the individual had been able to negotiate putting the single-use mask on top of their respirator.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an airborne pathogen which is transmitted when people inhale viral particles that infected individuals exhale when speaking, coughing, sneezing, and even just breathing.345 In contrast with droplet infection which usually occurs via a single ballistic hit, airborne infection risk increases incrementally with the amount of time the lining of the lungs spend continuously exposed to viral-laden air\u2014in other words, with time spent indoors breathing contaminated air.6\n\nSingle-use disposable masks substantially reduce (but, importantly, do not entirely eliminate) the egress of SARS-CoV-2 particles into the air from infected individuals (\u2018source control\u2019), hence a policy of requiring such masks is\u2014to the extent that people comply\u2014likely to substantially reduce the amount of virus circulating in the air and the overall level of transmission.789 However, single-use disposable masks are relatively ineffective at preventing ingress of viral particles in inhaled air (in other words, they do not adequately protect the wearer).7 This is partly because, unlike respirators (e.g. FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99), disposable masks are not made to any minimum filtration standard. But it is mainly because such masks often fit poorly, allowing air to enter around the gaps.10\n\nDowngrading masks and limiting protection matters for everyone. It puts us at greater risk of infection and thereby increases disruptions to our individual lives, increases load on the NHS, and exacerbates workforce shortages. However, it has a particular impact on those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. By April 2021, the UK\u2019s shielding programme had identified more than four million people who were at highest risk of severe illness from covid-19.11 Due to the much higher mortality rates in this group, the government went to great lengths early in the pandemic to protect them, advising them to leave home only to exercise or attend healthcare appointments. Use of health services by people classed as clinically vulnerable fell dramatically in the early months of the pandemic.11 There is anecdotal evidence that clinically vulnerable people in the UK are still choosing to avoid their GP and hospital appointments and cancel their operations rather than risk entering a healthcare facility in which few people are adequately masked.12 That they may be told to remove their own high-grade respiratory protection is an additional disincentive to accessing healthcare, with potential adverse consequences in the short- or longer-term.\n\nAsking patients and visitors to downgrade their masks is not limited to the UK. In a report from the US, healthcare facilities allegedly cited guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to justify such a policy.13 In British Colombia, Canada, a downgrade-your-mask policy is the subject of an ongoing class action lawsuit under province-wide human rights legislation.\n\nIt is unlikely that \u201cdowngrade your mask\u201d commands issued at the threshold of healthcare facilities were introduced as a deliberate policy intended to create disincentives and inequities for the most vulnerable patients. On the contrary, we believe they are the unintended consequence of two interacting influences, which we take in turn.\n\nFirst, poor understanding of transmission dynamics. It is hardly surprising that front line administrative staff misunderstand how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Major policy advisory bodies including the World Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England made confident announcements early in the pandemic that the virus was spread predominantly by droplets (which were believed to contaminate hands, objects, and surfaces) and that handwashing and surface cleansing were therefore the most crucial infection control measures. While face masks were depicted as \u201cfomites\u201d (accumulating concentrated virus as they became wet with exhaled droplets), the air people breathe was rarely depicted as a potential reservoir of infection except in rare circumstances such as the aerosol-generating procedures conducted by specialist doctors. Using this flawed mental model, replacing a \u201cdirty\u201d mask with one that is known to be \u201cclean\u201d before entering a healthcare facility makes sense.\n\nSecond, a rigid \u201ccompliance\u201d culture. A compliance organisation is defined as one that passively takes policy in from a regulator, implements that policy, and monitors how well it is followed (i.e. the only data collected in this case is whether visitors are wearing the issued masks).14 In contrast, a learning organisation is one where local implementation of policy is accompanied by feedback loops intended to evaluate and improve policy\u2014for example, by measuring nosocomial infection rates and systematically analysing complaints about the policy from patients or staff.15 Given that rigidity is associated with burnout and that increased cognitive load can often reduce flexibility of thinking, it is hardly surprising that we are seeing increasing instances of a \u201ccompliance\u201d culture in today\u2019s overloaded, burnt out NHS.161718\n\nThe above factors may help explain local downgrade-your-mask policies, but they do not excuse them. The practice is not supported by evidence, puts patients and others at risk, excludes vulnerable people from health services, thereby exacerbating health inequalities, and could potentially lead to expensive lawsuits. More widely, at a time when covid prevalence is at an all-time high and clear and consistent messages are needed about the importance of wearing high-filtration well fitting masks, when NHS staff suggest that loose paper masks are better than respirators, it becomes all the harder to persuade people that the opposite is the case.19\n\nIf, conversely, the NHS were to provide all visitors with free FFP2 or FFP3 masks to replace paper or cloth masks, it would bring multiple benefits within and beyond healthcare settings. It would address the alarming dropoff of health service usage by clinically vulnerable people and it would constitute a powerful public health intervention. It is time for the NHS to switch its policy from downgrading to upgrading masks.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: TG, SR and BK are members of Independent SAGE.

        "text": "Conclusions These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission.\n\nResults The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6%). 170 (86.3%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling.\n\nSetting A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022.\n\nThe observed clinical features of monkeypox infection in the 2022 UK outbreak differ from those in historical reports. We describe the characteristics and clinical features of monkeypox infection in people managed through a single south London centre and present a series of novel presentations.\n\nhas an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset\n\nA person with an unexplained rash on any part of their body plus one or more classical symptom or symptoms of monkeypox infection*\u2020 since 15 March 2022 and either:\n\nA person with an illness where the clinician has a high suspicion of monkeypox (for example, this may include prodrome or atypical presentations with exposure histories deemed high risk by the clinician, or classical rash without risk factors).\n\nA person with a febrile prodrome* compatible with monkeypox infection where there is known prior contact with a confirmed case in the 21 days before symptom onset.\n\nMonkeypox is designated as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK. 18 In the 2022 outbreak, the rapid community spread meant that most infected individuals were managed at home after risk assessment. 19 The box shows the current UK Health Security Agency case definition of possible and probable monkeypox infection. 20\n\nThe incubation period of monkeypox is currently understood to be about 12 days (range 5-24 days). 11 12 Classic descriptions of monkeypox infection depict biphasic clinical features, with a prodromal phase characterised by fever, malaise, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and headache, followed by skin eruption 2-4 days later. 11 Skin lesions follow a typical pattern of evolution, starting as macules and progressing into papules, vesicles, and pustules, which subsequently crust over and then desquamate. 13 15 Historically, lesions have appeared simultaneously and progressed sequentially. 16 Lesions have predominantly affected the face (95% of infected people), palms and soles (75%), mucous membranes (70%), and, less commonly, genitals. 5 Most infections are self-limiting and relatively mild, with symptoms lasting 2-4 weeks. Severe manifestations of infection include encephalitis, secondary skin infection, pneumonia, and ocular disease leading to loss of vision. Higher risk populations include neonates, children, and those with immunodeficiency. 17\n\nMonkeypox is due to an orthopoxvirus, which rarely causes disease in humans. Although the exact reservoir of the virus is still unknown, rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus was first identified in 1958, among primates in captivity for research purposes. 4 Two genetically distinct viral clades are described: Central African (Congo Basin) and West African. 5 The first reports of humans becoming infected were recorded in 1970, when a smallpox-like illness was investigated in areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo thought to be free of variola. 6 7 Monkeypox is endemic in the Congo Basin and West Africa, where outbreaks involving 23 to 88 people have been described. 8 9 Several animal species are susceptible to the infection, and animal to human transmission through handling and ingesting wild game animals has been identified as the primary route of infection in African outbreaks, followed by human to human transmission through close contact with infected individuals. 10 Spread of respiratory droplets and direct contact with skin lesions and scabs have been described as the predominant routes of transmission between humans, but transmission can also occur via fomites. 11 In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak in the Western hemisphere was reported in 11 people in the United States who had been in close contact with infected prairie dogs. These animals had been transported alongside a Giant Gambian rat, presumed to be the primary source of the infection. 12 Since 2018, travel associated monkeypox infection has been diagnosed in four people in the UK, with onward transmission to three further people. 13 Sporadic cases of imported infections have also been reported in the US, Singapore, and Israel. 14\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the UK High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) network was alerted to an individual with monkeypox who had recently returned from West Africa. Six further infected individuals were identified the following week, without epidemiological linkage to West Africa. As of 12 July, 1735 people had been identified with monkeypox in the UK, most (96%) occurring in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and 79% occurring in London. 1 2 People with monkeypox infection have also been reported in several other non-endemic countries in Europe and the Americas, with the highest reported case loads outside of the UK in Spain and Germany. 3\n\nThe research question for this study was formed through discussions with patients. Although there was no further direct patient or public involvement in this paper owing to limited resources, we have asked members of the public to read our manuscript after submission and also plan to disseminate key messages through social media and conferences.\n\nWe calculated means and medians for continuous data, and percentages for nominal data. The Clopper-Pearson exact method was used to calculate confidence intervals for symptom prevalence. Kaplan Meier for length of stay analysis was calculated using Graphpad Prism version 9.3.1. All other analysis was calculated using Microsoft Excel version 16.62.\n\nClinical data were collected through one of three electronic healthcare systems: Electronic Patient Record iSOFT Clinical Manager 1.6 (iSOFT Group, Falls Church, VA), eNoting Client (an in-house patient records system), and preView (IMS MAXIMS, Milton Keynes, UK). Data were collected on personal characteristics, signs and symptoms reported at presentation, mucocutaneous manifestations (description, number, characteristics, and locations), risk factors as defined by the UK Health Security Agency (travel, contacts, and sexual history), HIV status, and sexual health screen results. Typical lesions were defined as macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, umbilication, crust, or scab.\n\nAll people tested for monkeypox virus between 13 May and 1 July 2022 were identified through routine tracking of samples sent from the centre\u2019s virology laboratory to the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. Those who tested positive were included for further study.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective observational analysis of people with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed monkeypox virus, who were tested and managed through a south London HCID centre. The centre is one of five HCID centres in the UK and serves an inner city central and south London population. Swabs for diagnostic sampling were taken from the lesions at affiliated community sexual health and HIV medicine services, on admission to hospital (inpatient ward or emergency department) or on transfer of patients with suspected monkeypox from neighbouring NHS trusts (see supplementary figure 1). Samples were processed at the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Porton Down, UK. 21 People with suspected and confirmed monkeypox infection were risk stratified according to disease severity, immune status, and their ability to self-isolate, and managed accordingly. As part of routine clinical care, individuals were clinically assessed before testing. All people with a positive PCR test result for monkeypox virus took part in a telephone consultation to be counselled about their result and to conduct a risk assessment.\n\nOf the 98/295 people who tested negative for monkeypox virus by PCR, the most common clinical presentations were rash (n=46, 47.0%), oral or genital ulcers (n=16, 16.3%), and pustules (n=24, 24.5%). Other presentations included rectal symptoms (n=8, 8.2%), sore throat (n=2, 2.0%), fever (n=1, 1.0%), and hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1, 1.0%).\n\nMedian length of stay for discharged participants was 8 days (interquartile range 3.5 to 10 days) (see supplementary figure 3). One participant remains in hospital, and one additional patient was transferred to a different hospital for capacity reasons.\n\nNo participants required organ support or died. One participant required patient controlled analgesia with fentanyl for severe rectal pain. Five participants had substantial proctitis confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one participant with rectal pain developed a rectal perforation that was managed conservatively, and one patient developed necrotising secondary bacterial infection. Participants with rectal pain were treated with oral and topical analgesia (paracetamol, ibuprofen, opioids, and lidocaine gel); rectal suppositories containing emollient, mesalazine, or steroid; and oral laxatives. To date no adverse events associated with these treatments have been observed.\n\nThe most common clinical reasons for admission were perianal or rectal pain (8/20 participants) and penile swelling (5/20). Three participants had perianal or groin abscesses. Two participants had tonsillar abscesses. Two participants required ophthalmology review owing to eye involvement. Urinary retention, superimposed bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, and disseminated lesions in the context of immunocompromise occurred in one patient each. Of 20 participants admitted to hospital for clinical reasons, 15 (75.0%) had HIV co-infection. Three (15.0%) of the admitted participants were considered to have immunosuppression due to either HIV or immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nTwenty five (12.7%) participants were admitted to hospital, of whom 20 (10.2% of the total cohort) were admitted for clinical reasons. The remainder were admitted for containment as they were unable to effectively self-isolate at home.\n\nOf those tested for concomitant sexually transmitted infections, 34 (21.1%) tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 18 (11.2%) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 11 (7.0%) for herpes simplex virus 1 or 2, and 6 (3.7%) for Treponema pallidum ( table 4 ). Overall, 56/178 (31.5%) participants had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection, and 12 of these cases had more than one simultaneous sexually transmitted infection. Nineteen participants were not screened for any sexually transmitted infection at initial review.\n\nSeventy of the 197 (35.5%) participants had HIV-1 co-infection (n=2 unknown). Sixty four (91.4%) of these participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (n=4 unknown) ( table 3 ). Fifty five (78.6%) had an undetectable HIV-1 viral load (<200 copies/mL) (n=13 unknown). The median CD4 count was 664 cells/\u03bcL (interquartile range 522-894 cells/\u03bcL) (n=40 unknown).\n\nFifty four (27.4%) participants had a history of travel abroad within four weeks before symptom onset. Most common destinations were within western Europe: Spain (20), France (8), Belgium (4), Germany (4), and Greece (4). One participant had returned from an endemic area (West Africa).\n\nForty one of 155 (26.5%) participants reported known close contact with someone who showed symptoms of or had confirmed monkeypox infection (n=42 not recorded).\n\nOf the 197 participants, 196 (99.5%) identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\n\nNotably, 71 (36.0%, 29.3% to 43.2%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, 33 (16.8%, 11.8% to 22.7%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%, 11.0% to 21.6%) penile oedema. Overall, 31/111 (27.9%, 19.8% to 37.2%) participants with genital lesions had penile oedema and 60/82 (73.2%, 62.2% to 82.4%) participants with perianal lesions had rectal pain.\n\nSystemic illness was reported by 170 (86.3%) participants. The most commonly described systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%, 54.8% to 68.7%), lymphadenopathy (n=114, 57.9%, 50.6% to 64.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%, 25.1% to 38.5%) ( table 2 ). In contrast with existing case reports suggesting that prodromal systemic symptoms precede skin lesions, we observed a variable temporal association between mucocutaneous and systemic features. In 102/166 (61.5%, 53.6% to 68.9%) participants, symptoms developed before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestation and in 64 (38.5%, 31.1% to 46.4%) after (n=4, unknown). Twenty seven participants (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic symptoms.\n\nThe median number of lesions at presentation was 5 (interquartile range 3-11). Eight (4.1%) participants had more than 100 lesions. A numerical count of lesions was not documented for 29 participants. Twenty two (11.2%, 7.1% to 16.4%) participants presented with a solitary lesion: 12 involved the genitals and seven the perianal area. Twenty seven (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) participants described mucocutaneous manifestations as being pruritic and 27 (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) reported a concomitant widespread maculopapular rash.\n\nAll 197 participants (100%, 95% confidence interval 97.8% to 100%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations. These had a range of documented descriptions (see supplementary figure 2) and not all lesions progressed through the traditionally recognised evolution of macule to papule to vesicle to pustule to scab. Lesions were most commonly found on the genitals (n=111, 56.4%, 49.1% to 63.4%) and anus or perianal area (n=82, 41.6%, 34.7% to 48.8%). Genital lesions or perianal lesions, or both, occurred in 174 participants (88.3%, 83.0% to 92.4%) ( table 1 ).\n\nOf 295 people tested for monkeypox virus by PCR between 13 May and 1 July 2022, 197 (66.8%) tested positive. Overall, 155 (78.7%) of the participants presented via affiliated sexual health and HIV medicine services, 24 (12.2%) via an emergency department, and 18 (9.1%) after acute admission to a ward.\n\nNovel presentations\n\nWe describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men.\n\nPenile oedema Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis. One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment. Fig 1 Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant\u2019s arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over.\n\nSecondary bacterial infection One participant, a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 755 cells/\u03bcL), was referred for review with extensive genital lesions, penile swelling, and purulent penile discharge. He attended the emergency department when he first noticed spreading vesicles on his scrotum. A swab taken from the lesion confirmed monkeypox virus. The patient re-presented to the emergency department with progressive scrotal swelling, pain, and worsening penile ulceration and was subsequently admitted to hospital. On examination, extensive purulent lesions were identified on the penis and scrotum, with surrounding oedema (fig 2, also see supplementary figure 4). Vesicles were also noted on the arms and torso. No pain was elicited during digital rectal examination. Although there was no urinary retention or dysuria, the patient was catheterised because of concerns about increasing swelling of the penis. He was treated with co-amoxiclav to cover for a superadded bacterial infection but was switched to meropenem and clindamycin because of clinical suspicion of Fournier\u2019s gangrene. A swab sample taken from the penis grew Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Lesions were negative for herpes simplex virus. A computed tomography scan showed extensive penile ulceration, a large hydrocele, and fluid within the scrotum. There was no collection or gas within soft tissue. The participant remains an inpatient at the time of writing. Fig 2 Secondary bacterial infection of penis due to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Also see supplementary figure 4\n\nRectal perforation Overall, 71 (36.0%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, and this was a common reason for admission (n=8). Five participants had proctitis confirmed on MRI, with one having a perforated rectum and one a perianal abscess. One participant, a 46-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 1200 cells/\u03bcL), presented with severe rectal pain. Symptoms started with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, followed by severe rectal pain. He was seen in the sexual health service, started on empirical doxycycline for proctitis, and tested for monkeypox virus. Over the next two days the patient developed a papular rash on his upper arms and trunk. A week after symptom onset, the rectal pain became so severe the patient required admission to hospital for pain control. On examination, a papular rash with white exudates was identified in the oral cavity, along with right sided cervical lymphadenopathy. A cluster of tender, white perianal papules were located at the 3 o\u2019clock position. Digital rectal examination elicited noticeable tenderness in the rectum and anal canal. The patient had ongoing fevers and continued to develop new skin lesions. He was started on tecovirimat 600 mg twice daily for 14 days. Results were negative for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). No evidence of concomitant T pallidum infection was found. MRI on day 12 of symptoms showed active proctitis with evidence of a localised lower rectal wall perforation and associated collection (fig 3). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Fig 3 T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan of pelvis showing a 3.5 cm cavity in left mesorectum, adjacent to the rectal wall representing an area of localised perforation (arrow)\n\nSolitary lesion In total, 22 (11.2%) participants presented with a solitary cutaneous lesion. One participant, a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a single skin lesion on his thigh. Initially this was a small papule on the medial right thigh but developed into a painful mass with surrounding erythema. After review by a general practitioner, the patient started flucloxacillin, but with no benefit. He presented to the emergency department because the lesion had increased in size. He had no associated fever or other systemic symptoms. On examination a 4\u00d72 cm, tender area of induration with a central area of crusting was noted, along with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 4). The patient was admitted to hospital for treatment with intravenous antibiotics and further investigation. Ultrasound imaging showed inflamed subcutaneous tissues within the upper right thigh, with a tract to a further lesion in the upper right outer thigh, and reactive groin lymph nodes (see supplementary figure 5). Samples were negative for Leishmania, Rickettsiae, and T pallidum, and for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). The patient was discharged with oral co-amoxiclav. However, because of ongoing symptoms and the increase of monkeypox infection in the UK, he was reassessed and tested for monkeypox virus, with a positive result 13 days after symptom onset. How the patient became infected is unclear and there was no known sexual or other exposure to the virus. The patient was reviewed on day 18 by virtual consultation, at which time the crust on the thigh lesion had fallen off. Fig 4 Development of solitary lesion on right upper inner thigh, tracking laterally to outer thigh. Also see supplementary figure 5\n\nPolymorphic lesions Seventy (35.5%) participants had cutaneous manifestations at different stages of evolution at a single time point documented in the clinical notes. One participant, a 48-year-old man, presented with polymorphic skin lesions having first noticed a single erosion on his scrotum, which spread to the penile base and foreskin. On day 3 he developed pustular lesions with an erythematous base on his arms, behind his knee, below his ear, and on the bridge of his nose (fig 5). He attended the sexual health service and emergency department with ulcerated genital lesions and was treated with flucloxacillin. On day 5 he developed systemic symptoms, including fever, myalgia, back pain, headaches, and lethargy. By day 17 the genital lesions had crusted over; however, the patient developed new pustular lesions on his hands. By day 24, the lesions on the hands, legs, and face had crusted over. The previously crusted scrotal and penile lesions became ulcerated, and the patient was treated with co-amoxiclav for a suspected secondary bacterial infection. A swab grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Screening results were negative for herpes simplex virus, T pallidum, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis. Fig 5 Cutaneous lesions on the nose, hand, and penis over time. On day 17 there were fresh pustular lesions on the hand, a partly scabbed lesion on the face, and fully scabbed lesions on the penis\n\nMaculopapular rash Twenty seven (13.7%) participants reported an erythematous maculopapular rash of varying distribution and rapid onset, separate to areas of blistering or pustules. One of these participants had positive syphilis serology (n=4 unknown). One participant, a 36-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count >400 cells/\u03bcL), reported a rapidly progressive maculopapular rash soon after developing perianal vesicles. The vesicles initially progressed into three pruritic, pustular, perianal lesions. On day 4 the patient presented to the sexual health service with rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and difficulty defecating. He was treated empirically for proctitis with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and aciclovir 400 mg three times daily. On day 6 the patient awoke to a widespread symmetrical, pruritic maculopapular rash across his torso, back, legs, and buttocks, and reported inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 6; also see supplementary figure 6). He denied any fever or systemic features. Results for herpes simplex virus, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis (3 in 1 sampling) and T pallidum were negative. By day 8 the perianal lesions had begun to crust over, tenesmus had improved, and the rash had started to diminish. Fig 6 Symmetrical maculopapular rash of the torso, back, and buttocks. Also see supplementary figure 6\n\nOropharyngeal manifestations Twenty seven (13.7%) participants had oropharyngeal lesions and nine (4.6%) had tonsillar erythema, pustules, oedema, or abscess. One participant, a 25-year-old man, presented with a right sided tonsillar abscess. He described developing right sided neck pain, quickly followed by an erythematous, pruritic rash over his trunk. He subsequently developed fever, progressively worsening right submandibular swelling, and pain, and he reported fatigue. The swelling increased, resulting in dysphagia and difficulty breathing. The patient was referred to his local ear, nose, and throat centre where a right tonsillar abscess was observed. A single papule was noted on the patient\u2019s right forearm. A swab taken from the papule tested positive for monkeypox virus, and the patient was transferred to the high consequence infectious diseases ward. On examination he had a widespread symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash over his chest (sparing the midline), back, and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema (fig 7). Smaller areas of a petechial rash were also noted. The right tonsil was enlarged, with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate, with associated right cervical lymphadenopathy (fig 7). A small, crusted lesion was evident on each antecubital fossa. The patient had no genital or anal lesions. He was treated with benzylpenicillin and metronidazole. Tonsillar and skin swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Over the course of hospital admission, the rash subsided and the dysphagia improved. Two repeat throat swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were negative. Additionally, test results for blood cultures, respiratory viral screen, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus PCR, and HIV, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and mumps IgM were all negative. Fig 7 (Left) Symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash on back and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema. (Right) Right tonsillar enlargement with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate with slight deviation of the uvula\n\nAbscesses Two participants had soft tissue abscesses identified on ultrasound examination. One of these participants, a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a left sided groin abscess 10 days after he had shaved the area. The patient attended the emergency department for a left inguinal swelling, which had enlarged over three days, and the patient had associated fever and headache. The swelling had an overlying pustule, which the patient had described as an ingrown hair follicle. On examination, the swelling, measuring 6\u00d78 cm, was incised and drained by the surgical team. The next evening the patient developed papules and pustules over the mons pubis and face, followed by his neck, wrists, and back (eight lesions in total). Test results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling) were negative. About five days later all the lesions had crusted over."

        "text": "Ramon Lorenzo-Redondo , assistant professor and bioinformatics director 1 2, Egon A Ozer , assistant professor and director 1 2, Judd F Hultquist , assistant professor and associate director 1 2 1Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA 2Center for Pathogen Genomics and Microbial Evolution, Northwestern University Havey Institute for Global Health, Chicago, IL, USA Correspondence to: R Lorenzo-Redondo ramon.lorenzo{at}northwestern.edu\n\nDeath certification data support an intrinsically lower case fatality rate for omicron\n\nSoon after the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern was first reported to the World Health Organization on 24 November 2021, preliminary observational studies in South Africa suggested this highly transmissible variant was associated with lower hospital admission and mortality rates in people with covid-19 infection.1 However, given omicron\u2019s increased propensity to cause reinfections and vaccine breakthrough,23 it was unclear if this effect was due to previous immunity in the population or an inherent property of the genetically divergent variant.\n\nSubsequent analyses further supported a lower risk of severe outcomes in infections with omicron compared with delta, although these data were limited to all cause deaths within 28 days of diagnosis.4 Additionally, many public health measures previously enacted to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission were being relaxed in early 2022, potentially resulting in more infections in relatively low risk populations. These limitations complicated efforts to assess the true risk of severe disease and mortality associated with omicron infection.\n\nThe linked retrospective cohort study by Ward and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070695) takes a further step towards addressing this question. The study reported new evidence that mortality rates were lower for infections with the omicron BA.1 subvariant than for the delta variant of concern, even after controlling for patient demographics, previous infection, and vaccination status.\n\nThe study team used the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset to access census data, mortality records, vaccination dates, and other standardised measures for over one million UK adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2021 when omicron and delta were circulating. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction test results were mined for spike gene target failure, with specimens failing to amplify the S gene classified as BA.1 compatible. Although less reliable than whole genome sequencing, this technique can distinguish delta from BA.1 by detecting the deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike gene characteristic of BA.1 (present in almost 95% of BA.1 lineage sequences v 0.2% of delta).5 Death certification records definitively identified over 350 covid-19 related deaths in the cohort. Ultimately, the risk of covid-19 related death was found to be 66% lower in people infected with omicron than in those with delta, similar to the 69% lower risk reported by Nyberg and colleagues.4\n\nThis study provides the most conclusive evidence to date that infection with the omicron subvariant BA.1 was inherently less deadly than delta when controlling for a number of key covariates. Combining death certification records with molecular surveillance is the main advantage of this study, which avoids previous biases in covid-19 death designations. Accounting for a broad array of standardised covariates, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, and previous immunity, is another strength.\n\nSimilar to previous reports, risk of covid-19 death with omicron decreased in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Although the reduction was more pronounced in unvaccinated and boosted populations relative to the double vaccinated, this is likely skewed by the very low mortality rate among vaccinated people and the fact that booster shots were prioritised for at-risk populations during the study period.\n\nThe study also has some limitations that curtail its generalisability. Despite the strengths of the Public Health Data Asset, data collection is limited to adults in the UK and might not reflect observations in other countries or in children. A reliance on hospital system data likewise could skew cohort characteristics due to possible biases in the population captured by these data. Finally, as previously noted, the use of spike gene target failure as a proxy for variant identification carries some risk of misclassification.\n\nWhile consensus is forming that omicron infections are associated with lower mortality rates (including preliminary data on BA.4 and BA.5), several considerations remain. Firstly, it is still unclear why the risk of death is lower. Is this due to omicron\u2019s increased capacity to avoid immune recall67 leading to lower immune activation, altered viral tropism,89 changes in anatomical localisation,10 improvements in clinical care, or a combination of these and other factors? Understanding the causes is critical for assessing risks as variants continue to emerge.\n\nSecondly, a broader discussion on optimal strategies for communicating risk and implementing appropriate public health responses is necessary. Early reports suggesting lower mortality in people with omicron infections11 were widely broadcast with limited emphasis on the underlying uncertainty. While these early observations are ultimately being corroborated, effective communication will be essential for individual risk assessments and broader public health responses as the pandemic continues to evolve.\n\nFinally, it is essential to continue to develop, optimise, and deploy systems that integrate molecular surveillance, demographic, epidemiological, and clinical datasets to enable timely research. Investment in this infrastructure will be critical for the continued response to covid-19 and for future pandemic preparedness.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

        "text": "Elisabeth Mahase The BMJ\n\nOne in eight covid-19 patients (12.7%) is likely to experience long term symptoms, a study from the Netherlands has reported.1\n\nUsing digital questionnaires, researchers collected data on the frequency of 23 symptoms commonly associated with covid in an uninfected population and in people who had had a covid diagnosis.\n\nThe findings, published in the Lancet,1 found that 21.4% (381/1782) of adults who had had covid experienced at least one new or severely increased symptom three to five months after infection when compared with before. This compared with only 8.7% (361/4130) of uninfected people followed over the same period.\n\nThe core long covid symptoms highlighted by the researchers include chest pain, difficulties breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and smell, tingling extremities, lump in throat, feeling hot and cold, heavy arms or legs, and general tiredness.\n\nThe questionnaire was sent out 24 times to the same people from March 2020 to August 2021. During this period people would have been infected with alpha or an earlier variant, and most people were unvaccinated.\n\nOver 76 000 participants completed a total of 883 973 questionnaires, the average age of respondents was 54, and 61% were female. A group of 4231 (5.5%) participants who had covid were then matched to 8462 controls who did not, taking into account sex, age, and the time of covid diagnosis.\n\nAranka Ballering, study author and a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, said, \u201cBy looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cPost-covid-19 condition is an urgent problem with a mounting human toll. Understanding the core symptoms and the prevalence of post-covid-19 in the general population represents a major step forward for our ability to design studies that can ultimately inform successful healthcare responses to the long term symptoms of covid-19.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledged some limitations to the study, including that it did not include an ethnically diverse population and that because of asymptomatic infection they may have underestimated the true prevalence of covid-19. Additionally, some symptoms that have been highlighted as potentially relevant to long covid, such as brain fog, were not considered during the study.\n\nThis article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "title": "Covid-19: virology, variants, and vaccinesThis latest review discusses the genetics, structure, and transmission methods of covid-19 variants, highlighting how mutations provide enhanced abilities to spread the virus",
        "link": "https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000040",
        "text": "Introduction Seven coronaviruses can infect humans, all belonging to the alpha or beta subgroups, including 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta).1 Over the past two decades, three notable beta coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2011; and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019) have emerged and caused severe illness, resulting in debilitating disease and worldwide deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and has caused more than 5.59 million deaths in around two years and resulted in multisystem illness in several million people.2 All viruses change and mutate over time, with most changes having little to no impact. However, some mutations could alter its pathogenic or transmission potential and might, therefore, increase disease severity or hinder the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization3 classifies variants of concern as SARS-CoV-2 variants that increase transmissibility, disease severity, or virulence or that decrease the effectiveness of public health measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. Variants of interest are variants with genetic changes predicted to enhance the virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which have been identified to cause community transmission in multiple countries and pose a possible risk to global public health. Lastly, variants under monitoring are those with genetic changes are suspected to affect virus characteristics and have currently unclear phenotypic or epidemiological effects. Variants under monitoring are not typically assigned a name until they are upgraded to variants of interest or concern. The full working definitions of variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring can be found on the WHO website for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).3 As of 25 January 2022, WHO reports five variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron), two variants of interest (lambda and mu), and three variants under monitoring.3 Former variants of concern, variants of interest, or variants under monitoring have been reclassified as \"formerly monitored variants,\" owing to these variants no longer circulating, having little impact on the epidemiological situation, or having no concerning properties.3 Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the rapid development of effective covid-19 vaccines has taken place around the world. As of 24 January 2022, 33 vaccines have been approved for use in 197 countries, with 10 vaccines having gained emergency use listing approval from WHO.4 In this review, we provide an overview of the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2, describing how these elements allow the virus to infect and replicate inside of host cells, before outlining how certain mutations harboured by SARS-CoV-2 variants enhance these abilities. Next, we examine the current state of vaccine development around the world and provide evidence of the effectiveness of booster doses.\n\nSources and selection criteria We searched PubMed and Embase databases for covid-19 related articles published between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2022 and for general coronavirus related articles published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Our search terms included SARS-CoV-2, covid-19, and specific terms including virology, genome, variants, and vaccine. Additional, specific search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 1. We performed further manual searching for additional articles and data using relevant databases, including who.int, gov.uk, and ecdc.europa.eu/en. Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of the literature involving SARS-CoV-2, we also searched preprint databases including MedRxiv and BioRxiv. We selected studies through different criteria (online supplemental file 1), owing to the various topics discussed here. Overall, studies were selected on the basis of quality and impact factor of publishing journal, with real world studies with large sample sizes of the greatest interest. Supplemental material [bmjmed-2021-000040supp001.pdf]\n\nViral transmission, clinical presentation, and genetic susceptibility of covid-19 SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread via respiratory droplet transmission, spreading between people through close contact, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission, fomite transmission, and via other modes, such as through biological material including urine and faeces.5 6 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces or survive suspended in air droplets for long periods. Indeed, on plastic, stainless steel, and glass surfaces, the half life of the virus is around 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 hours, respectively,7 with no difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 variants.8 Although SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on inanimate surfaces for hours and days, owing to the evaporation of water droplets (the viruses\u2019 living environment), the concentration of the virus plummets rapidly.9 Protective measures, including use of personal protective equipment, maintenance of indoor ventilation, and disinfection hands and surfaces, can effectively limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.10 Once inside the airways, SARS-CoV-2 can infect ciliated, mucus secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes within the lungs, and the conjunctival mucosa.11 The clinical presentation of covid-19 is non-specific and heterogeneous, and infection can result in a wide spectrum of symptoms. After an incubation period of 4-14 days, symptoms range from mild to severe disease and, in some instances, can result in death.12 The most common covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue,13 14 while myalgia, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms are reported. Asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for covid-19.15 16 Although the entire population is susceptible to covid-19 infection, some subgroups within the general population are more susceptible to developing poorer clinical outcomes. Risk factors associated with increased probability of hospital admission, severe disease, and fatal outcome with covid-19 have been identified. Older age17\u201319; male sex20 21; belonging to an ethnic minority group21 22; and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease,18 23\u201325 malignancy, and immunodeficiency26\u201328 have all been associated with more severe covid-19. The duration and treatment of covid-19 symptoms will also have profound influences on the severity of disease and the acute and long term outcomes after recovery. The host genetic background is thought to have an influence on the susceptibility and severity of covid-19, possibly explaining the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that can develop in seemingly similar individuals. A meta-analysis, consisting of 49,562 patients with covid-19 across numerous ancestry groups, identified four gene loci associated with susceptibility to covid-19 (SLC6A20, RPL24, ABO, PLEKHA4) and nine associated with increased risk of severe covid-19 (LZTFL1, FOXP4, TMEM65, OAS1, KANSL1, TAC4, DPP9, RAVER1, and IFNAR2).29 Meanwhile, genome wide association studies spanning across Europe, the US, and the UK identified a gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) as being strongly linked with susceptibility and severity of covid-19.30 31 Polymorphisms in the genes of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have also been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 viral entry,32 33 with differential polymorphisms seen across ethnic minority populations, which might partly explain why certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe covid-19. Increased ACE2 receptor levels have also been associated with other risk factors of covid-19, including smoking and increasing age.34 The use of polygenetic risk scores might be useful in determining an individual\u2019s risk for developing severe disease caused by covid-19.35 A polygenetic risk score infers a person\u2019s risk of susceptibility to, or development of, a certain disease based on the total number of genomic variations they possess. Determining polygenetic risk scores with the inclusion of comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,36 or other aspects such as coagulation factors,37 could improve the usefulness of these scores in determining a person\u2019s risk of severe covid-19.\n\nVirology of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses, which have crown-like appearances, are the largest known RNA viruses and are thought to primarily infect vertebrates.38 39 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus of the coronaviruses and has a genome size varying from 29.8 to 29.9 kb.40 Human coronavirus genomes consist of a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs). Following the typical 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order, the beginning two thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, inside the host cell, are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum into polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), respectively.40 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp): nsp1-11, from pp1a; and nsp12-16, from pp1ab. The proteolytic release of nsp1 occurs rapidly, which enables it to interfere with translation processes of the host cell by inducing cellular mRNA degradation.41\u201343 Nsp2-16 contain the viruses\u2019 replication and transcription complex and encode multiple enzymes with many functions, including proteases, helicase, polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease, N7-methyltransferase and 2\u2019O-methyltransferase, and de-ubiquitination enzymes.44 45 The final third of human coronavirus genomes contain genes that encode structural and accessory proteins. The four major structural proteins encoded here are the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike glycoprotein (S) proteins.46 47 The N protein is associated with the viral RNA genome, is involved in RNA synthesis regulation, and interacts with the M protein during viral budding.39 48 The M protein is important for viral assembly, it contains a short N-terminal domain that projects onto the external surface of the envelope and a long internal C-terminal.39 The E protein function is largely unknown; however, along with the N and M proteins, it is required for viral assembly and release.47 Lastly, the S protein gives coronaviruses their characteristic spikes that compose their crownlike appearance. This protein projects through the viral envelope, is heavily glycosylated, and regulates host cell membrane receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.49 The functions of the 11 accessory proteins encoded within the one-third closest to the 3\u2019 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not fully understood. These accessory proteins are encoded by the ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORC9c, and ORF10 genes. Some of these proteins, including ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, are interferon antagonists that impair the host cell immune response,50\u201353 whereas ORF3a might promote virus release54 and is involved in apoptosis of host cells through caspase-3 activation.55 ORF9b and ORF9c are known to suppress the host antiviral response by interacting with host cell organelles,56\u201358 whereas a clear understanding of the functions of ORF3c, ORF7b, and ORF10 remains unclear.59 Figure 1 (A,B) depicts the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genome and spike (S) protein amino acid composition. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30 000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of open reading frames (ORF) and elements that are essential for the virus\u2019 structure. The S protein is responsible for binding and entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain various S protein non-synonymous mutations that result in amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain (orange bracketed text) and the S1/S2 subunit interface (black bracketed text), which have been shown to enhance transmissibility of the virus. Variants of concern include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and omicron (O). (B) SARS-CoV-2 structure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has a crown-like appearance and contains four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M). (C) Viral S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with human ACE2 receptors in order to gain entry into host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein tightly binds to ACE2. (D) S protein structure. The S protein protrudes out from the main SARS-CoV-2 bulk and is comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 contains the RBD, which directly interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, while the S1/S2 interface contains a furin cleavage site that is cleaved to allow S2 to fuse with the host cell membrane. Both the RBD and the S1/S2 interface contain transmissibility increasing mutations that are harboured in variants of concern The S glycoprotein is composed of two functionally distinct subunits (S1 and S2) and is essential for viral entry into host cells. The N-terminal S1 domain of the protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cell, which is the primary receptor that SARS-Cov-2 uses for cell entry.60 The C-terminal S2 domain fuses the host and viral membranes to allow for entry of the viral genome into the host cell.61 The subunits of the trimeric S complex are either in a closed (pre-fusion stage) or open (post-fusion stage) conformation,62 with one subunit always in an open conformation to allow for ACE2 recognition and binding.63 The RBD itself consists of five anti-parallel \u03b2 strands surrounded by several \u03b1 helices.64 From closed to open conformation, the RBD undergoes structural rearrangement whereby the globular head region rotates clockwise, which alters is elecropotential surface.64 Once positioned, numerous residues within the RBD form either hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with residues of the ACE2 receptor, allowing for tight binding,65 while the concave structure of the RBD allows for three distinct binding regions.64 Following binding between the S protein and the host cell receptor, host cell proteases cleave the S protein, causing the release of the S2 domain which allows for fusion and cell entry.66 Figure 1 (C,D) shows the structure and function of the S protein. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous cell types throughout the human body, including in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosas, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain,67 highlighting the widespread infection that SARS-CoV-2 can inflict. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2, a host cell protease, facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes,68 and could have a role in the spread of the virus in the airways.68 Host cell cathepsin L might also aid in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the S protein.69 Indeed, a clinically approved protease inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.70 Figure 2 depicts the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into and replicates inside host cells, and summarises the host cell immune response.

Epithelial cells in the lungs express both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing for infection by SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the virus within these cells induces an intense immune response that attracts monocytes, T cells, and macrophages and, in some instances, can result in a cytokine storm. (B) Within nearby blood vessels. Cytokines produced by the epithelial cell layer are released into blood vessels supplying the infected tissue, which causes the recruitment of further immune cells to the area, driving the damaging inflammatory response further. Circulating cytokines also create a systemic inflammatory environment. (C) Adaptive immune response. Circulating lymphocytes carry viral antigens to lymph nodes and bone marrow to begin the adaptive immune system processes whereby B cells, and later antibodies, are activated. (D) SARS-CoV2 host replication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into human cells. Following release of the viral RNA within the host cell, the virus uses the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to produce and manufacture new viral particles, which are released out of the cell to infect other cells and new hosts\n\nEmerging treatments As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19.309 Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK,310 311 US,312 313 and Europe314 315 for treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK,316 US,317 and Europe.318 These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below.\n\nGuidelines The treatment and management of covid-19 is a continually evolving topic; however, health authorities have published and continue to update guidelines and recommendations for treating covid-19. The WHO living guideline on covid-19 and treatment is regularly updated, with the latest version (published on 14 January 2022) containing 14 recommendations on covid-19 treatment.319 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence320 and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency321 provide updated guidelines on covid-19 treatment, and in Europe, the ECDC regularly publishes several guidelines providing recommendations on a range of covid-19 related topics.322 The US National Institutes of Health323 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention324 provide guidance on covid-19 treatment and management, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplying guidelines for specific groups such as employers, schools, health departments, and governments.\n\nConsiderations for the future Novel infectious diseases and pandemics are an unpredictable but inevitable aspect of nature; therefore, we should learn from past pandemics to prepare for future ones. Firstly, the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and amplified the existing inequalities within society,325 with Black ethnicity, social disadvantage, and unemployment being risk factors for covid-19 infection326 and those groups most economically deprived found to be particularly vulnerable.327 These inequalities need resolving in order for us to be better prepared for similar situations in the future. Next, to progress through a pandemic we should be racing against the pathogen, and not against each other. This statement becomes apparent when considering the problems faced by countries seeking out personal protective equipment,328 and the vaccine inequity seen worldwide,329 with developed countries often better placed to be able to purchase these items. Initiatives such as WHO\u2019s COVAX programme are vital to protect the most vulnerable groups and reduce the global spread of disease. In October 2021, the UK government released a publication outlining where the policies implemented to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic failed, and the lessons learnt from these failures.330 The publication then presents conclusions and recommendations on how to enhance pandemic preparedness, lockdown and social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, social care, and vaccines. In countries such as the UK, US, and much of Europe, where the covid-19 death rate has been high, steps need to be taken and lessons need to be learnt in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. The responsibility of improving pandemic response lies with policy makers, the medical/scientific community, and the public, and will ultimately require a collaborative approach. However, certain aspects of the response to the covid-19 pandemic have been a triumph. One major victory was the rapid development and rollout of vaccines,331 which continue to be effective. The rollout of rapid testing and quarantine for infected individuals was also important to at least disrupt the spread of the virus, especially given that asymptomatic individuals can contribute to the spread. Furthermore, the swift identification and sharing of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants between countries should be applauded. Lessons can be learnt from countries where covid-19 was controlled. In Taiwan, authorities managing the pandemic as directed by pre-covid-19 pandemic plans prompted an immediate response. Screening of all airline passengers arriving from Wuhan and high risk areas, restricting entry for non-Taiwanese citizens, 14 day quarantine periods for contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 or returning travellers, a ban on large gatherings, and widespread mask wearing were some of the quickly implemented management strategies.332 New Zealand implemented similarly effective restrictions, with the addition of a national lockdown.332 Many of the pandemic control components that kept infection and death numbers low in Taiwan and New Zealand could be adopted by other countries in the future and could lead to improved outcomes in terms of protecting the health of individuals and the health and wellbeing of the country. Overall, much can be learnt from the covid-19 pandemic and, as we emerge from it, the inspection of which policies failed and which succeeded is imperative.\n\nConclusion Covid-19 remains prevalent and life threatening. Although the rollout of vaccines has been successful, attaining a high global vaccination coverage and ensuring that all healthcare systems have the capacity to cope with seasonal waves are essential. With the omicron variant highly prevalent, we must continue to learn, develop therapeutics, and remain vigilant to new variants of concern. Here, we have provided an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, including the mutations harboured by variants of the virus and how these mutations effect its transmissibility and virulence. We have also discussed the vaccines that have been developed and used around the world and have provided evidence supporting the rollout of booster doses. Future priorities should focus on continuing vaccination programmes and developing variant specific vaccines as new mutations emerge. This strategy, along with the expansion of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and which treatments are most successful to treat covid-19 infections will ultimately lead to favourable outcomes. Questions for future research How will the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutate in the future, and which mutations will give a competitive advantage that will allow the virus to inflict disease to many people?\n\nHow do we keep up with the rapidly changing SARS-CoV-2 environment and ensure that vaccines remain effective?\n\nHow do we manage the booster programme and when will future booster vaccinations be required in order to maintain high levels of immunity?\n\nHow can we learn from the current and past pandemics so that we are better prepared for the next one?

        "text": "Conclusion Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.\n\nResults The study found increased risk of thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (incidence rate ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.47 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (5.27, 4.34 to 6.40 at 8-14 days); increased risk of venous thromboembolism after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.10, 1.02 to 1.18 at 8-14 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.86, 12.76 to 15.05 at 8-14 days); and increased risk of arterial thromboembolism after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.06, 1.01 to 1.10 at 15-21 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.02, 1.82 to 2.24 at 15-21 days). Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nMain outcome measures The primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism within 28 days of three exposures: first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; and a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events.\n\nParticipants 29 121 633 people were vaccinated with first doses (19 608 008 with Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and 9 513 625 with Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2 mRNA)) and 1 758 095 people had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. People aged \u226516 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest were included in the study.\n\nWe evaluated the short term risks of thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism associated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccines, or a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021. We also evaluated the risk of prespecified secondary outcomes of interest, namely CVST, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events according to a prespecified protocol. 15\n\nThe situation is further complicated by evidence on the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and thromboses. 4 A US study estimated that the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately seven times greater than that associated with the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) covid-19 vaccines. 13 Direct comparisons between these vaccines and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were not possible because the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is not used in the US. Evaluation of the safety of new vaccines relies on case reports or series, and analyses of large scale health data. While informative, case reports are limited by small numbers, and potential selection, recall, and recording biases. In contrast, routinely collected electronic health data contain recording of the exposure, outcomes, and confounders, and provide a rich source of data to enable the robust evaluation of rare vaccine safety events. 14\n\nRecently, thrombocytopenia and rare thromboembolic events after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine have been reported in Denmark, Norway, 6 7 Germany, Austria, 8 and the United Kingdom. 9 This prompted several countries to limit the use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on the basis that the benefits might not outweigh the risks. 8 9 10 11 The United States has reported similar events associated with the Ad26.COV2-S (recombinant) Janssen vaccine, resulting in a pause in its roll-out. 12\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have been tested in randomised clinical trials 1 2 3 that are designed to establish efficacy and safety, but insufficiently powered to detect rare adverse events. If a new vaccine has a serious adverse profile (even if the risk is rare), then a risk-benefit evaluation could lead to withdrawal of the vaccine or restrictions on its use in the interests of public safety. These risks, however, need to be balanced against the risks of covid-19 itself leading to adverse events and death. 4 Safety evaluation is particularly important when vaccine development has been accelerated, the vaccines are new, and when rapid worldwide deployment of covid-19 vaccines has occurred, with 1.43 billion doses already administered worldwide. 5\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and period We undertook a self-controlled case series from 1 December 2020 to 24 April 2021 (the latest date for which outcome data were available) to examine the associations between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and thrombotic events during the ongoing covid-19 vaccination programme in England. We also investigated the association between a SARS-CoV-2 positive test and the thrombotic events of interest among the same vaccinated population. The self-controlled case series was originally developed to assess risks of adverse events to vaccination.16 The case series determines the relative incidence of the outcome of interest for exposed time periods (eg, after vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection) compared with unexposed baseline periods in people with the outcome of interest (see supplementary fig 1). Inference is within people and therefore this implicitly controls for all covariates that remain constant during the study period. We selected patients with each outcome during the study period and determined dates when they had the vaccine or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Separate analyses were carried out for each outcome of interest.\n\nData sources We used the National Immunisation Management System register of covid-19 vaccination to identify vaccine exposure, which includes vaccine type, date, and doses for all people vaccinated in England. We linked individual level data to national data for mortality, hospital admissions, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Linkages are conducted to protect patient anonymity because the hashed ID used to link patients cannot be reversed. Vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 positive test data were available until 24 April 2021. Hospital admission data were obtained from two sources: Hospital Episode Statistics (up to 31 March 2021), which includes any admission, and Secondary Users Service (up to 24 April 2021), which includes only admissions with an outcome (death or discharge). We used the QResearch database of 12 million patients linked to the above dataset to calculate background incidence rates for each outcome before the pandemic (2015-19). QResearch includes demographic, clinical, and drug data, and is used for clinical1718 and drug safety research.1920 QResearch is one of the largest and most representative primary care research databases nationally,21 covering approximately 20% of the population of England.\n\nInclusion criteria We included all people aged \u226516 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest. We excluded people who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine because of very small numbers. We used the first event in the study period and excluded patients from the analysis of each outcome if they had a hospital admission for the same event in the two years before the start of the study period.\n\nExposure Our main exposures were the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We censored people on the earliest of the following: date of their second dose, date of death, or study end date (24 April 2021). Our secondary exposure was a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, using the first date of a positive test (not the date of reporting) as the exposure date. We defined the exposure risk intervals as the following prespecified time periods: 0, 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28 days after each exposure date (vaccination date or date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Multiple risk intervals were used to differentiate between acute and non-acute phases after vaccination. The baseline period (without exposure) was defined as any time between 1 December 2020 and 29 days before the exposure date, and from 29 days after the exposure date until 24 April 2021 or the censored date if earlier. A pre-risk interval of 1-28 days before each exposure date was included to deal with possible bias that might arise if the occurrence of the outcome temporarily influenced the likelihood of exposure.22 Histograms of the data by interval between vaccination and event day are shown in supplementary figure 2a. The graphs show a drop of hospital admissions or deaths for each outcome about 28 days before vaccination, hence the choice of the pre-risk period. Hospital admissions for the event of interest are probably the trigger for the covid-19 test. Such events might be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the reverse causality involved in their detection induces bias. To reduce the bias, which could overestimate or underestimate the effect of infection, we decided to allocate day 0 to a risk period on its own.23\n\nOutcomes Our three composite primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism. Our prespecified secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: CVST, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events. Hospital inpatient admissions from 1 December 2020 to 24 April 2021 with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases version 10) diagnosis code in their first 13 diagnoses fields that indicated the outcome of interest were identified in the Hospital Episode Statistics and Secondary Users Service databases. Supplementary table 1 gives a list of ICD-10 codes and groupings for each outcome. We used the earliest date of hospital admission or date of death for the relevant event as the event date. Cause of death in the UK is assessed by the medical practitioner who attended the patient during their last illness, and if not seen in the preceding 14 days, the cause is determined by a coroner based on assessment of medical evidence.\n\nStatistical analysis We described the characteristics of each cohort (patients who had been vaccinated with the outcomes of interest) in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. The self-controlled case series models were fitted using a conditional Poisson regression model with an offset for the length of the risk period. Incidence rate ratios, the relative rate of hospital admissions or deaths due to each outcome of interest in risk periods relative to baseline periods, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using each model. Exposure terms for both vaccines and for infection with SARS-CoV-2 were included in the same model. To account for temporal changes in background rates, we divided the study period into weekly blocks starting on 1 December 2020 and adjusted for these changes as discrete covariates in the analysis. We used Wald tests to compare risks associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. We investigated whether the associations between vaccine exposures and outcomes are sex or age dependent by running the analyses in separate subgroups by sex and age group (younger or older than 50 years).\n\nSensitivity analyses We conducted six sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding those who died from the outcome; (2) restricting analysis to the period after vaccination or after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test, without censoring at death; (3) censoring at 12 weeks after vaccination; (4) censoring on 10 March 2021; (5) restricting the study period until 31 March 2021; and (6) restricting the analysis to patients who had their vaccination after 1 January 2021. The first two analyses tested the assumption that the occurrence of an outcome event did not influence the probability of subsequent exposures, such as through death.22 The third analysis tested the sensitivity to our approach of censoring patients at the time of the second dose (to avoid contamination of baseline time). The additional censoring at 12 weeks after the first dose of vaccine was used because this is the recommended time for a second dose in the UK. Concerns over CVST and blood clots were raised first in Europe around 10 March 2021, and so we censored on this date for the fourth sensitivity analysis; this allowed us to include only time unaffected by any notoriety bias (because of media attention, thrombotic events might have been more likely to be reported on death certificates or hospital admission records if healthcare professionals were aware of recent ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination). The fifth analysis tested the completeness of the data, and the sixth analysis was done to have comparable time periods and priority groups for the two vaccines.\n\nAssessing the self-controlled case series assumptions To further assess the assumptions of the self-controlled case series and our modelling choices, we visually examined the data. We plotted a histogram of the number of occurrences of an event by time before or since vaccination for each outcome to assess the possibility that a hospital admission for that event might affect subsequent vaccination (supplementary fig 2a). We plotted a histogram of the time from event to actual end of observation in patients who were censored and uncensored to assess if event dependent observation periods could be a problem for the analysis (supplementary fig 2b). Event dependent exposures\u2014supplementary figure 2a shows the number of occurrences of an event by time before or after vaccination. We observed a decrease in the 28 days immediately before vaccination, indicating that occurrence of an event might have reduced the likelihood of vaccination. This pattern is similar for most of the outcomes and for both vaccines. Therefore, we have added the pre-risk period of 28 days. Event dependent observation periods\u2014supplementary figure 2b shows the frequency of days from event to actual end of observation in censored and uncensored patients. A spike close to zero is apparent in the censored data histogram for most of the outcomes, excluding CVST. This finding indicates the presence of event dependent observation periods (censoring on death date due to outcome), which we tested further with the first and second sensitivity analyses (excluding those who died from the outcome; restricting analysis to the period after vaccination, without censoring at death). These additional analyses agreed with the main analysis, suggesting that there should be little concern about these outcomes.\n\nAbsolute measure of risk In self-controlled case series analysis, results are presented in relative terms\u2014the ratio of the incidence in the exposure risk periods relative to the incidence in control periods. We supplemented these results with measures of effect of each exposure in absolute terms using a method developed to estimate the number of exposures needed to produce one excess adverse outcome and the excess number of events per 10 million exposed for each outcome.24 These measures were computed for a period of 8-28 days after vaccination to remove the healthy vaccinee effect seen at 0-7 days after vaccination. To make numbers comparable, the same measures were computed for the same period after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test.\n\nNegative or positive controls We examined the associations of exposures with coeliac disease as a negative control outcome25 because it was not thought to be associated with exposure to vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection; and with anaphylaxis as a positive control outcome because it could occur shortly after either vaccine.26"

The term \u201clong covid\u201d was coined by patients, initially being used on social media to describe symptoms that were impairing quality of life.9 We argue that this experience generates an obligation to recognise long covid as a potentially disabling condition defined by clinical diagnostic criteria and supported by ongoing clinical research. Such recognition would also re-enforce the obligation of the state to extend and expand supportive infrastructure and policy for people with other disabilities. The need for just social policies grounded in contemporary theories of disability, designed by disabled people for disabled people, can also form the basis for advocacy and policy change beyond the pandemic.\n\nWhat is long covid? Although long covid is widely acknowledged to exist, diagnostic criteria vary, with different authorities acknowledging a diversity of symptoms and severity levels. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and impaired memory, and sensory changes like permanent loss of smell or taste.10 Physiologically, long covid may cause damage to extremities, in some cases requiring amputation1112; multiorgan injury such as chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis or transplant1314; or respiratory complications and persistent post-exertional symptoms. These symptoms may exist in isolation or in clusters, and though they range in severity, many greatly affect people\u2019s wellbeing and life plans. The exact prevalence of long covid is unknown because the wide range of presentations overlap numerous other conditions, there is no definitive diagnostic test, some people with long covid may struggle to access care (and thereby be counted), and covid-19 testing was difficult to access in many settings at the beginning of the pandemic. In the UK, the Coronavirus Infection Survey conducted from April 2020 to August 2021 estimated between 3% and 11% of 15 061 participants with covid-19 infection experienced symptoms for more than 12 weeks.15 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found up to 20% of 353 000 patients aged 18-64 years had one symptom attributable to covid-19 more than four weeks after infection.16 At its lower bound, at least 16.5 million of the 562 million people infected with covid-19 worldwide as of 20 July 202217 may have long covid, but at its higher estimates, the number could extend to over 100 million people. Symptoms of long covid can persist for over a year and potentially be permanent. One international online survey in 2020 of 3762 people in 56 countries with confirmed or suspected covid-19 who had illness lasting over 28 days found 45% of respondents had required a reduced work schedule, and another 23% had left the workforce because of suspected long covid.18 Long covid in children and young people could similarly jeopardise educational attainment.\n\nLong covid and disability Long covid itself may not be a disability but given its potentially debilitating effects on people\u2019s lives, it can be disabling. Long covid symptoms may also constitute disabilities because of loss of human function or because of a persistent impairment that undermines a person\u2019s quality of life.19 Another way in which long covid symptoms may be disabling is if a person experiences social discrimination or social subordination, wherein they lose status in society as a result of perceived \u201cdefective bodily functioning.\u201d1920 Some evidence suggests that people with long covid already experience discrimination. For example, in a cross sectional survey of 127 patients with long covid symptoms conducted between August 2020 and March 2021 in Japan, 55 people had experienced at least one form of discrimination and stigma, including being treated as if still contagious or being the subject of harmful rumours or verbal harassment.21 Subsequent research does not suggest attitudes have changed.22 People with long covid can also experience social isolation, stigma, and loss of social identity because of their inability to perform at work, maintain their relationships, care for their families, exercise, and so on.23\n\nClear diagnostic criteria facilitate care and legal recognition Long covid would be better understood as a potentially disabling condition if there were clinical diagnostic criteria to create meaningful pathways to care. This would benefit people with disabling symptoms in at least three ways. Firstly, those affected may need ongoing medical and allied care to retain or restore functions or to fulfil their life plans. Applications for state funded disability related health assistance usually require a clinical examination and sometimes a diagnostic code, such as an ICD-10 code. Diagnostic criteria for long covid may facilitate access to interventions and services that support social engagement and physical function (eg, hand rails, modified work environments, or access to rehabilitative therapy or psychiatric care). Clear diagnostic criteria\u2014supported by ongoing research into the underlying mechanisms of persistent symptoms24 \u2014might also reduce uncertainty and validate the experience of patients with long covid, including those who did not have access to testing at the time of presumed infection. A 2020 qualitative study in 24 patients with long covid identified uncertainty and being taken seriously as important concerns.25 The third and potentially more profound implication of establishing diagnostic criteria for long covid is in legal recognition of disability through instruments such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US and the Equality Act 2010 in the UK. Because people with long covid may experience long term, substantial impairment of their ability or autonomy to participate in society, in principle these instruments may already cover long covid. For example, the Equality Act covers discrimination on the grounds of \u201cprotected characteristics,\u201d one of which is disability, and can require employers and others to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d for people with disabilities. However, the widely variable presentations of long covid and absence of definitive diagnostic criteria or biomarkers may make it harder for patients to prove that they qualify as disabled. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act also requires people to prove qualification before they can claim a right to accommodations.26 This means that the disability must be recognised by a court rather than relying on self-reported limitations in a person\u2019s ability to undertake major life activities. Conversely, formally conceiving of long covid as a disability in law or policy is not the same as an individual determining whether their identity has changed to include \u201cdisabled.\u201d This creates a tension between self-identification as disabled and the law, where it is often necessary to have clear definitions and boundaries. Excessive focus on biomarkers or black and white diagnostic criteria for long covid could inadvertently exclude people who experience debilitating symptoms that do not fit accepted definitions of disease.27 Disability is not merely a medical phenomenon but a social one, and a loss of social function should be included as part of an assessment of disability. Given the strong grassroots and patient led movement to recognise long covid, patients and advocacy groups should be included in developing disease criteria as a basis for self-identification.28 The successes of disability rights movements and other movements such as HIV/AIDS activism, in which self-advocacy formed the basis for change are instructive: nothing about us, without us.29 Establishing well defined criteria can empower people with long covid by providing a long term basis for coalitions and building communities. These can be leveraged into activism and political action to bring about social change, including by organising to motivate state responses to long covid.\n\nState obligations Diagnostic criteria can provide the basis for care and accommodations, but it is the state that is required to meet the needs of people with disabilities through medical care or other political, infrastructural, or welfare systems. In the case of long covid, these needs may be diverse. People with organ injury will require continued and robust access to affordable and accessible healthcare. Those whose symptoms impair mobility may require aids or modifications to their physical environments, like many other people with physical disabilities. People with cognitive deficits, profound fatigue, or psychiatric symptoms may require specific support\u2014for example, access to unemployment or other benefits, modifications to their work duties or schedule, or allowances for remote working when symptoms preclude commuting.30 Flexible attendance and modified activities for students with brain fog and other stress mediated effects of long covid may be necessary to support educational attainment.31 Increases in funding for, training, and availability of home care aides for families will arguably be needed when care givers and primary earners are affected by long covid. Many of these accommodations and improvements will arguably be best financed or accomplished through state intervention and may require policy interventions. For example, private firms may decide against the perceived additional expense of accessibility unless it is considered \u201creasonable\u201d and enforceable by legal protections such as the Equality Act in the UK. Given the potential scale of long covid, novel workplace legislation mandating the right to remote work and flexible work hours (for long covid as well as other important needs such as other disabilities, family illness, and childrearing) would improve accessibility. There may even be grounds to invert the status quo on accessibility and make the right to flexible work a presumption, effectively placing the onus on employers to justify on-site work requirements. For people whose symptoms flare or require additional medical leave, legislation introducing formal paid time off legislation in countries that do not have it would be a step towards an equitable society built on the recognition of disability. In other cases, accommodation may simply be a public good. Historically, mobility aids such as dropped kerbs in pavements allowing access to the road and ramps into or through buildings rather than stairs benefit people with a variety of mobility needs\u2014some, but not all, resulting from disability.32 These public works are typically achievable at scale only with state support and also benefit the broader population. These accommodations are social needs that predated the pandemic but are now critical with the rise of long covid. Crucially, support services are currently understaffed and under-resourced. The covid-19 pandemic has seen the degradation or collapse of welfare services, combined in some countries with decades of defunding and neglect.33 These services now have millions of new users. Recognition, respect, access to care, and an adjustment of our social norms and infrastructure have long been demands of disability activists. Covid-19, as in many other areas of life, may have shown the depth of our failures, but it did not create them. The emergence of long covid has made visible an emerging disability community that has the potential to shine a light on disability rights. What is now needed is a concerted political will to act to benefit the millions of individuals who are, or will become, disabled as a result of this global pandemic. Key messages The rise of long covid has created millions of new people with disabilities who will have to navigate the post-pandemic world\n\nThe need for change to support people with disabilities predated the pandemic\n\nLong covid needs to be legally recognised as disabling through clinical research and practice\n\nThe state must support people with long covid through expanded or reformed infrastructure and policy and by changing social norms\n\nSuch changes will benefit all disabled people and wider society\n\nFootnotes Contributors and sources: The authors include philosophers, public health experts, and social scientists.

These limitations complicated efforts to assess the true risk of severe disease and mortality associated with omicron infection.\n\nThe linked retrospective cohort study by Ward and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070695) takes a further step towards addressing this question. The study reported new evidence that mortality rates were lower for infections with the omicron BA.1 subvariant than for the delta variant of concern, even after controlling for patient demographics, previous infection, and vaccination status.\n\nThe study team used the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset to access census data, mortality records, vaccination dates, and other standardised measures for over one million UK adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2021 when omicron and delta were circulating. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction test results were mined for spike gene target failure, with specimens failing to amplify the S gene classified as BA.1 compatible. Although less reliable than whole genome sequencing, this technique can distinguish delta from BA.1 by detecting the deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike gene characteristic of BA.1 (present in almost 95% of BA.1 lineage sequences v 0.2% of delta).5 Death certification records definitively identified over 350 covid-19 related deaths in the cohort. Ultimately, the risk of covid-19 related death was found to be 66% lower in people infected with omicron than in those with delta, similar to the 69% lower risk reported by Nyberg and colleagues.4\n\nThis study provides the most conclusive evidence to date that infection with the omicron subvariant BA.1 was inherently less deadly than delta when controlling for a number of key covariates. Combining death certification records with molecular surveillance is the main advantage of this study, which avoids previous biases in covid-19 death designations. Accounting for a broad array of standardised covariates, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, and previous immunity, is another strength.\n\nSimilar to previous reports, risk of covid-19 death with omicron decreased in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Although the reduction was more pronounced in unvaccinated and boosted populations relative to the double vaccinated, this is likely skewed by the very low mortality rate among vaccinated people and the fact that booster shots were prioritised for at-risk populations during the study period.\n\nThe study also has some limitations that curtail its generalisability. Despite the strengths of the Public Health Data Asset, data collection is limited to adults in the UK and might not reflect observations in other countries or in children. A reliance on hospital system data likewise could skew cohort characteristics due to possible biases in the population captured by these data. Finally, as previously noted, the use of spike gene target failure as a proxy for variant identification carries some risk of misclassification.\n\nWhile consensus is forming that omicron infections are associated with lower mortality rates (including preliminary data on BA.4 and BA.5), several considerations remain. Firstly, it is still unclear why the risk of death is lower. Is this due to omicron\u2019s increased capacity to avoid immune recall67 leading to lower immune activation, altered viral tropism,89 changes in anatomical localisation,10 improvements in clinical care, or a combination of these and other factors? Understanding the causes is critical for assessing risks as variants continue to emerge.\n\nSecondly, a broader discussion on optimal strategies for communicating risk and implementing appropriate public health responses is necessary. Early reports suggesting lower mortality in people with omicron infections11 were widely broadcast with limited emphasis on the underlying uncertainty. While these early observations are ultimately being corroborated, effective communication will be essential for individual risk assessments and broader public health responses as the pandemic continues to evolve.\n\nFinally, it is essential to continue to develop, optimise, and deploy systems that integrate molecular surveillance, demographic, epidemiological, and clinical datasets to enable timely research.

        "title": "Incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis following covid-19 vaccination",
        "link": "https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-069445",
        "text": "Conclusions These findings indicate that adolescent and young adult men are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Use of a Pfizer vaccine over a Moderna vaccine and waiting for more than 30 days between doses might be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 years is very rare but certainty was low. Data for clinical risk factors were very limited. A clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appeared to be benign, although longer term follow-up data were limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (eg, biopsy and tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism.\n\nResults 46 studies were included (14 on incidence, seven on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short term course, three on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines was highest in male adolescents and male young adults (age 12-17 years, range 50-139 cases per million (low certainty); 18-29 years, 28-147 per million (moderate certainty)). For girls and boys aged 5-11 years and women aged 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) could be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). Incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine had very low certainty evidence. For individuals of 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12-17, 18-29, or 18-39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine for covid-19 might be lower when administered \u226531 days compared with \u226430 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18-29 years indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to \u226556 days to substantially drop myocarditis or pericarditis incidence. For clinical course and short term outcomes, only one small case series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In adolescents and adults, most (>90%) myocarditis cases involved men of a median 20-30 years of age and with symptom onset two to four days after a second dose (71-100%). Most people were admitted to hospital (\u226584%) for a short duration (two to four days). For pericarditis, data were limited but more variation than myocarditis has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing, and rate of admission to hospital. Three case series with longer term (3 months; n=38) follow-up suggested persistent echocardiogram abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms or a need for drug treatments or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. Sixteen hypothesised mechanisms were described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence.\n\nEligibility criteria for selecting studies Large (>10 000 participants) or population based or multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination; case series (n\u22655, presentation, short term clinical course and longer term outcomes); opinions, letters, reviews, and primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesised mechanisms.\n\nData sources Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 6 October 2020 to 10 January 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to 13 January 2021). One reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine learning program to prioritise records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\n\nObjectives To synthesise evidence on incidence rates and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after use of mRNA vaccination against covid-19, clinical presentation, short term and longer term outcomes of cases, and proposed mechanisms.\n\nFinally, we asked what are the hypothesised mechanisms involved in myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA covid-19 vaccines, and do they vary by patient or vaccine characteristics?\n\nThe fourth question asked what the prognosis is in the longer term (\u22654 weeks) among individuals of a similar age and sex who had myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination, and does this vary by patient characteristics or vaccine?\n\nThirdly, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination, in children younger than 12 years, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? From our original review, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination (ie, across all ages and after a second vaccine dose)?\n\nSecondly, among individuals of a similar age and sex, what risk or protective factors exist for myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? Examples of factors include pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, pharmacotherapies (eg, hormones), type of vaccine product, length of vaccine dosing interval, and vaccine combinations for first v second v booster doses.\n\nWe asked five main questions for the review. Firstly, what is the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? We used data stratified by age and sex, in individuals aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, or 18-29 years after their second dose, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination.\n\nThis evidence synthesis included systematic reviews of incidence rates (in people aged 0-39 years) and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination, evidence reviews of initial presentation and clinical course and of longer term outcomes of cases, and a description of proposed mechanisms and their supporting evidence. We originally reviewed (in our literature search on 6 October 2021) incidence rates, risk factors, and case presentation and short term outcomes of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination across all vaccines, ages, and sexes. Our results indicated that incident rates were very low to none after non-mRNA vaccines and in adults aged 40 years and older, that rates after mRNA vaccination varied by sex, age, and dose, and that the case characteristics and clinical course of myocarditis and pericarditis differed. 15 At that time, no data were available for children aged <12 years or for people after receiving a third dose. For this review, we refined the questions to focus on gaps and priorities of the stakeholder or decision maker, specifically, mRNA vaccines, priority age and risk groups, and cases after a third vaccine dose. Where possible, we limited cases to those confirmed by medical record review and of myocarditis or myopericarditis, or pericarditis rather than in combination (when data were available separately). We also expanded the scope to include evidence on longer term outcomes. Finally, we added descriptions and studies of hypothesised mechanisms. This report focuses on the refined questions but also includes findings on characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after any dose of the vaccine across all ages from the original review.\n\nMyocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and pericarditis, an inflammatory disease of the pericardial sac, can occur in isolation, although some patients present with overlapping features. Viral causes are common for both disorders. Symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis typically include new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or a combination of these symptoms. 11 Diagnosis of a probable case of myocarditis usually requires elevated troponin concentrations or findings from imaging (eg, echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging) or other testing (eg, echocardiogram); histopathology for a definitive diagnosis is not usually done. 12 Differential diagnoses, including covid-19 infection or other viruses, should be considered and ruled out. 12 13 Most people with these conditions will fully recover. Myocarditis can lead to heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, whereas long term consequences associated with pericarditis include one or more recurrences and, rarely, thickening of the pericardium and constrictive heart filling. 14\n\nCase reports and surveillance signals 1 2 3 4 of myocarditis (including myopericarditis) and pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination appeared as early as April 2021, leading to the surveillance of adverse events of special interest after vaccination with mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). Estimated rates of myocarditis are 11 per 100 000 person years in the UK 5 and 1-2 cases per 100 000 person years in the US, 6 7 regardless of age. In the US, estimated background rates or expected rates after covid-19 vaccination of myocarditis is 0.2 per one million people and of pericarditis is 1.4 per one million people, after adjustment for a 7 day risk period where most cases appear. 6 Historically, myocarditis has been more prevalent in male than female individuals, from childhood through young adulthood, 8 and this tendency was reflected in early post-covid-19 vaccination case series. 9 10\n\nMethods\n\nWe developed a protocol before screening began and synthesis of evidence. Knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada contributed to scoping the reviews but did not participate in their conduct. We followed guidance for systematic reviews when conducting16 and reporting17 questions one and two. The reviews are now living and future updates will be posted on the COVID-END website at https://www.mcmasterforum.org/networks/covid-end.\n\nLiterature search We worked with an experienced medical information specialist to develop the search strategy, which was peer reviewed (see acknowledgments).18 Searches combined concepts for covid-19, vaccines, and myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiovascular manifestations, adverse events, surveillance; each concept included various keyword and medical subject heading terms. We originally searched on 6 October 2021 and updated the search on 10 January 2022; the updated search (appendix 1) was slightly modified from the original search (eg, adding omicron, removing non-mRNA vaccine terms). We did not add limits for language, country, or study design, but had limits to exclude case reports and news or newspaper articles. Using the multifile option as well as the de-duplication tool in Ovid, we searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and epub ahead of print, in-process, in-data-review and other non-indexed citations and daily from 1946 to 10 January 2022, inclusive, and Embase 1974 to 10 January 2022, inclusive. We searched grey literature by scanning 20 key national websites (eg, Public Health Agency of Canada, UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to identify unpublished data. On 13 January 2022, we searched L-OVE, CT.gov, Cochrane covid Reg, WHO Covid reg, and Google Scholar for additional grey literature. We scanned reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews and consulted our clinician authors (AM and IP) and an expert consultant (Bruce McManus; see acknowledgments) to identify potentially eligible studies on mechanisms. All studies and reports included in the original review were screened for eligibility for the revised questions in this update.\n\nEligibility criteria Our inclusion criteria are outlined in box 1. Studies could be eligible for more than one question. Box 1 Eligibility criteria for each question Population People of any age; data for questions one and two (Q1 and Q2) must be reported using age categories (eg, 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 18-29, 30-39, \u226540 years) and by dose. If incidence rates were very low and for question two on risk factors, we included data across sexes if no other study reported by sex.\n\nIncident rates after a second dose of vaccine in Q1 were intended to be limited to people younger than 30 years; because several studies reported on an 18-39-year-old category, we included these data, as well as that for people aged 30-39 years, in a post hoc manner. Intervention or exposure Q1: mRNA vaccines approved in Canada: BNT162b2 RNA/PfizerBioNTech/Comirnaty, mRNA-1273/Moderna Spikevax (alternative manufacturers of same vaccine are eligible), by type of vaccine and dose.\n\nQ2: Same as Q1, plus potential risk or protective factors: pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, length of vaccine dosing interval, type of vaccine, vaccine combination for first versus second versus booster doses.\n\nQ3-Q5: Confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination. For Q3, part 2, cases did not need to be confirmed.\n\nAt least one dose of the vaccine needed to be with an mRNA vaccine; one or more other doses might have been with a non-mRNA vaccine.\n\nFor Q3-Q5, we included exposure to myocarditis or pericarditis (combined) if no separate data were available. Control or comparator Q1: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but no longer at risk for outcome, previously vaccinated with other vaccines (ie, controlling for confounders associated with vaccine uptake), or unvaccinated people; or no comparator.\n\nQ2: People vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but without the risk or protective factor. Might be a different type of mRNA vaccine, interval between doses, or mixture of vaccines for different doses.\n\nQ3: No comparator.\n\nQ4: No comparator but will include data for any comparisons with people vaccinated and no myocarditis or pericarditis.\n\nQ5: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine who did not have myocarditis or pericarditis; or no comparator. Outcome Q1: Incidence rate or cumulative risk of confirmed myocarditis (including myopericarditis) or pericarditis by dose. Effect measures: incidence rate or cumulative risk (might be risk difference if accounting for background rate in control group). Will include rates of myocarditis or pericarditis (reported collectively) if no data are available for these separately.\n\nQ2: Ratio measures of incidence or reported events by risk or protective factor (eg, RR or odds ratios), adjusted for key confounders (eg, previous covid-19 illness and severity) when reported. Will include rates of myocarditis or pericarditis (reported collectively) if no data is available for these separately.\n\nQ3: Characteristics of the patients (eg, age, sex, pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases) and infections (eg, recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infection), race and ethnicity) and case presentation (eg, timing, dose, type of vaccine; diagnostics; illness severity; treatments provided; short-term outcomes).\n\nQ4: As in Q3, plus any outcomes measured \u22654 weeks after onset of myocarditis or pericarditis (eg, re-admission to hospital, functional capacity, chest pain).\n\nQ5: Authors\u2019 summaries of any hypotheses or findings after investigating potential mechanisms (eg, histology, experiments with viral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (encoded by mRNA vaccine)), gene panels, serology for innate and acquired immune system components, autoimmune antibodies). Setting Any setting and country.* Study design Q1: Large (>10 000 vaccinated people) sample or multisite or health system based observational studies; reports or databases of confirmed case using surveillance data.\n\nQ2: Observational studies (including case control studies) with number of \u226510 with the risk or protective factor; data for subset of people with myocarditis or pericarditis may come from passive reporting systems.\n\nQ3: Case series with five or more cases; data could come from medical record review of cases reported to active or passive surveillance systems (if reporting more than age, sex, and dose and type of vaccine); for Q3, part 2, we relied first on case series reported in systematic reviews and added data on cases from more recent case series or studies included for incident rates if they reported sufficient data on clinical course.\n\nQ4: Case series with at least five cases; data might come from medical record review of cases reported to active or passive surveillance systems.\n\nQ5: Any primary study, systematic review, or expert opinion article or letter on the topic.\n\nLetters and commentaries will be included if they provide sufficient data. Publication language English full texts.\n\nWe cite those excluded based on language. Publication year and status From October 2020 onwards (vaccines were authorised in mid-September 2020).\n\nPreprints are included. RETURN TO TEXT\n\nStudy selection All reviewers JP, LH, LB, LG, and AW undertaking screening conducted a pilot round in Excel using 300 records. We then conducted screening in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners) using structured forms. For title and abstract review, we applied the machine learning program Daisy AI, which continually reprioritises records during screening.19 Records were divided among reviewers with one reviewer screening titles and abstracts and another reviewer verifying exclusions for the first 50% of records. For full text selection, one reviewer reviewed all records, and a second reviewer verified all exclusions. Studies were further verified for inclusion during data extraction. For question three part 2, we mapped the case series by country and data source to identify the most recent and comprehensive data source for each geographical region (ie, US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Israel). For regions with multiple reports, we prioritised data that were most recent, most comprehensive (largest numbers), and based on confirmed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. We aimed to avoid overlap in data (ie, the same cases reported in different sources). However, we did include sources that reported on specific subgroups (eg, 12-17 year olds) to present more details on these groups of interest. We have noted in the tables where overlap might be present in cases between reports and we avoided aggregating events and counts across studies.\n\nData extraction We extracted all data into a structured format in Microsoft Word and conducted a pilot exercise with two studies for each question. Thereafter, one reviewer extracted data and another verified study eligibility and all data. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead (JP or LH). For question one, we extracted data that related to all elements of the eligibility criteria (box 1) and data used for risk of bias assessment. We focused on methods for identifying cases (ie, passive surveillance versus active surveillance or registry data), outcome ascertainment and confirmation or adjudication (including criteria for case definitions and classification), as well as the dosing interval and risk interval for which the events were captured. We preferred estimates of incidence compared with an unexposed group (ie, excess incidence or risk differences) over those without a control. For question two, we extracted data as for question one, along with associations or subgroup analyses based on pre-existing conditions, different vaccine types or products, dosing interval, and combinations of vaccines. We extracted rates in each group and (if reported) the relative effects between groups (eg, incidence rate ratio and odds ratios), adjusted for key confounders (ie, infection status, cardiac and immunodeficiency or autoimmune conditions) when reported. For questions three and four, we based data extraction on the evidence table presented in an existing review9 because these findings covered most of the items specified under our outcomes in box 1. We added the following items: criteria for confirmation of cases, breakdown of cases by diagnosis (myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis), data source, age included, percentage of patients with pre-existing conditions, percentage of patients admitted to an intensive care unit, percentage of patients admitted to hospital, and number of fatalities. For question four, we also added longer term investigations and outcomes. For question five, we extracted verbatim authors\u2019 summaries of any hypotheses and, where available, findings by the authors or cited works investigating potential mechanisms (eg, histology, gene panels, serology for innate and acquired immune system components, autoimmune antibodies, tissue biopsies, autopsy findings, etc). We checked references used to support statements made by authors in proposing or explaining hypotheses to identify whether they provided direct empirical evidence (ie, specific to covid-19 mRNA vaccination). Three content experts (AM, IP, BM) reviewed proposed mechanisms for comprehensiveness and interpretation.\n\nRisk of bias assessment For questions one and two, all reviewers involved in the risk of bias assessments (JP, LB, LG, and AW) piloted the risk of bias tool with two papers. We used the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) checklist for cohort studies,20 with modifications mainly to ascertain valid risk factor measurement (appendix 2). We focused on valid and reliable case finding and confirmation, and, for question two, accounting for key confounders. Assessments were completed by one reviewer and verified by another. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead. For questions three and four, we did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The intent of these questions was to characterise patients and their clinical course, rather than providing quantitative estimates, for example, of incidence. In this case, we judged the main risk of bias to come from case ascertainment: whether each report includes only cases confirmed or verified by clinicians. To deal with this potential bias, we limited inclusion to confirmed cases (question three part 1 and question four) or extracted this information and considered its potential effect when summarising the results (question three part 2).\n\nData synthesis and certainty assessments For question one, we did not pool results due to heterogeneity in case finding (passive v active surveillance), dosing and risk intervals, age groupings, and, in some cases, some degree of overlap in cases expected between studies. We tabulated all results and compared and contrasted findings between studies based on the major differentiating population, vaccine, and methodological variables. We report the range in incidence rates across studies, or, when all rates are low, concluded that the incidence is fewer than 20 cases per million, which, based on our clinical investigator input, we considered very rare. Based on input from clinicians and our knowledge users from Public Health Agency of Canada, we developed the key age categories (0-4, 5-11, 12-17, and 18-29 years) to rely on when possible. If a study contributed more than one result within these (eg, 20-24 and 25-29, results for each mRNA vaccine) we calculated a weighted average (eg, by proportion of years in the age range) of the incident rates. When a study reported an incidence rate (or data to calculate this) and an incidence rate ratio compared with a control or background rate, but not the difference in incidence (excess incidence over background rate), we calculated the excess incidence (ie, crude incidence \u2212 (crude incidence/ incidence rate ratio)). We assessed the certainty for each of our conclusion statements using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance.212223 We did not apply a threshold for an important incidence rate, but in general, we considered fewer than 20 cases per million doses to be very rare. For question two, associations (odds ratio or relative risk) of 1.5 or more were considered clinically relevant (ie, odds ratio <1.5 shows little-to-no association). Observational studies for incident rates (question one) started at low certainty (ie, our confidence in the incident rate is limited; the true rate might be substantially different from the estimate) and studies on risk factors (question two) started at high certainty21 (ie, we are very confident that the true difference in rate between risk groups lies close to the estimate). We rated down for serious concerns about risk of bias, inconsistency or absence of consistency (single study), indirectness, imprecision, or reporting biases. We rated down for risk of bias when only studies having high risk for case ascertainment contributed to an outcome (eg, passive surveillance where we assume there is under-ascertainment). We also rated down for indirectness for comparisons across both sexes or if the age group reported did not match one of our groups of interest (eg, 13-39 year olds) and the incident rates could vary substantially among ages. We rated down for imprecision in groups with fewer people than would be expected for one event to occur based on estimated baseline incidence rates (eg, a subgroup with 8000 people but reporting zero events). We considered uprating when incidence rates were large (eg, twice or more than our 20 per million threshold) when no other major limitations were evident and we had moderate confidence in our conclusion, often reported as a range of incidences.24 In our conclusions, we have used the terms probably, might, and uncertain to reflect, respectively, moderate, low, or very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE. When we have very low certainty, we made no conclusions about specific incident rates or other outcomes. For questions three and four, we present the details for each case series in an evidence table and provide a descriptive summary. For question five, we present a summary of the mechanisms and a more descriptive table."
