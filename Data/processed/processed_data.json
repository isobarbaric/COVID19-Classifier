        "text":"Answer: N95 masks are the gold standard, but other good options exist if you do not have an N95, primarily KN95 masks and well-made, well-fitting, 3-layer cloth masks. Disposable surgical masks are also readily available but tend to leave gaps between the mask and face, reducing their usefulness (although there are ways to improve it). If you want to find and buy a good mask that meets the guidelines of the U.S. CDC as well as the World Health Organization, go right to Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy. If you want an N95 respirator, see Finding the Best N95 Masks section. If you want a KN95 respirator, see the Finding the Best KN95 Masks section. If you want to make your own mask (which can be quite effective) see the Best combination of materials for making a mask section. We also identify what seem to be the best disposable filter materials. Masks can be used alone or, for increased protection, particularly for the eyes, with a face shield \u2014 which we have also reviewed. Here's what we cover in this answer: Why and when you should wear a mask While vaccination to protect against COVID-19 has led to a decreased need for masking in certain situations, unvaccinated individuals are still advised to wear a mask when in public indoor settings. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, masks are recommended for fully vaccinated individuals when in indoor spaces with high community transmission rates, as well as for fully vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems or who are taking immune-suppressing drugs. Masks are also required for all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, when required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws (including local business and workplace guidance), on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. (Get more details about masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in our article about COVID vaccines). Along with social distancing, a mask provides additional protection from infecting others as well as preventing exposure. In addition, according to the CDC, \"cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns.\" A review of studies found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses was 82% lower with physical distancing of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or more, compared with shorter distances, and protection might increase with additional distance. Face mask use could result in an 85% reduction in risk of infection versus no face mask, with stronger associations for N-95 or similar respirators, while surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks were less effective but offered more protection than single-layer masks (Chu, Lancet 2020). As wearing a mask may reduce the amount of virus to which a wearer is exposed, it has been postulated that even if a mask-wearing person becomes infected, the reduced viral load to which they were exposed may mean that they suffer a milder disease. For example, on cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of infected patients (81%) were asymptomatic on a ship that had provided masks to all passengers and staff compared to only 18% of cases being asymptomatic on a cruise ship without masking (Gandhi, J Gen Intern Med 2020; Gandhi, N Engl J Med 2020). Another benefit of wearing a mask is that, due to the heat and moisture of exhaled breath, masks have been shown to increase the humidity and temperature of inhaled air, which, researchers have proposed, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as COVID by promoting the clearance of pathogens in the lungs (Courtney, Biophysical J 2021 -- preprint). Although previously reserved for healthcare workers to due a shortages in supply, the CDC advised on January 14, 2022 that N95 and KN95 respirators may be worn by the general public, with the exception of surgical N95 respirators, which are standardized for fluid resistance, i.e. blood splatter, and continue to be reserved for use in healthcare settings. In its updated guidance regarding masks and respirators the agency stated, \"While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, properly fitted respirators provide the highest level of protection.\" (See our reviews of N95 and KN95 respirators below.) It also emphasized that use of well-fitted masks and respirators are particularly important in high-risk situations and for people who may be at risk for more severe disease. [Note: On January 19, 2022, the U.S. government announced that it will make approximately 400 million N95 respirators available free of charge to the public, possibly as early as the week of January 24th. According to a New York Times article about the announcement, the N95s will be distributed through community centers and retail pharmacies and will be limited to three per person. Details about brands or models were not provided.] If using a cloth or disposable mask, be sure it fully covers the nose and mouth. Clear panel masks are acceptable to facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or who otherwise need to see a speaker's mouth in order to communicate. In addition to fully covering the nose and mouth, masks should also fulfill the following guidelines: Cloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source). (See our Top Picks among cloth masks that meet these requirements. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. Masks should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face. Masks should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures. Scarves, ski masks, turtlenecks pulled over the face, masks made from loosely woven material, and masks with slits, exhalation valves, or punctures are not acceptable. Face shields and goggles can be worn with masks, but cannot be worn instead of a mask. (See our Top Pick among face shields). Failure to wear a mask as described above is a violation of federal law and can be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and state and local authorities. The TSA has proposed a fine of $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders (TSA 2021). However, there are several exceptions to the requirement: Masks may be removed for brief periods of time when eating, drinking, or taking medication, while communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when required to verify one's identity, and when requested by a ticket agent or law enforcement officer. Any benefit to wearing masks at home? Although CDC guidelines do not currently include the use of face masks at home, the rate of transmission from one household family member to another was 79% lower when members wore face masks prior to the first member developing COVID-19 symptoms, according to a study of 124 families in Beijing in which there was at least one infected person. Overall, there was a 23% rate of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected family member to another, but this was no lower when mask wearing began after the first member developed symptoms. These results are consistent with the fact that viral load is highest two days before symptoms and on the first day of symptoms. Daily use of disinfectants reduced transmission by 77%. Transmission rates were four times higher if the primary case had diarrhea and 18 times higher when there was frequent daily close contact (less than 3 feet apart). The researchers recommended use of face masks in families in which a member has been at risk of getting infected. In China, over 70% of transmission occurred within families (Wang, BMJ Global Health 2020). Best combination of materials for making a mask Currently, both the CDC and WHO provide basic guidelines for choosing a cloth mask. According to CDC guidelines, a cloth mask should: Use a minimum of 2 - 3 layers, preferably with batting between the layers Use fabrics with high thread count and fine weave, water-resistant fabric, and hybrid fabrics such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel (cotton blends may be better than pure cotton). (In addition, the CDC notes that, due to their electrostatic charge, materials such as polypropylene may enhance filtration efficacy and fabrics such as silk can help to repel droplets.) Cover the nose and chin Fit snugly on the sides of the face without gaps Be secured with ties or ear loops Use ties rather than ear loops because ties provide better fit It also advises that if wearing a neck gaiter, choose one with two layers or fold it to make two layers. In addition, the CDC warns not to choose masks that are: Made of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, such as vinyl Have exhalation valves or vents, as this allows virus particles to escape Reserverd for healthcare workers (i.e. surgical N95s The World Health Organization (WHO) provides more details about which types of fabrics may work best. It recommends using three layers of fabric for non-medical, cloth masks in order to achieve the best combination of filtration efficacy and breathability: 1. Innermost layer: Hydrophilic material (i.e., one that can absorb moisture, such as cotton or cotton blends) 2. Middle layer: Hydrophobic material (i.e., repels moisture) of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a second cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets. 3. Outermost layer: Hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearer's nose and mouth. (See Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy for our review of masks for sale that appear to meet the WHO requirements) Note that polypropylene, a material often used to make disposable surgical masks, has an electrostatic charge which can improve the filtration efficiency of masks. Polypropylene \"spunbound\" is sold in fabric and many other retail and online stores under brand names such as Oly*fun and Pellon. Polypropylene is sold in different weights (measured in grams per square meter or GSM). Most commercially manufactured surgical masks are made of 3-ply 25GSM. Polypropylene materials between 25 and 40 GSM tend to have similar filtration efficacy and breathability, while polypropylene 60 GSM has a higher filtration efficiency but less breathability (Zhao, Nano Lett 2020). Be aware that some forms of polypropylene should not be machine washed. See below for a more detailed discussion of the filtration efficacy of various cotton and synthetic household fabrics. Note that Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) has advised against using face masks labeled as containing graphene (or biomass graphene) due to concerns that graphene particles might be inhaled (Health Canada April 2, 2021). Graphene is promoted for use in some masks as having antibacterial and antiviral properties. Preliminary research suggests that graphene particles may cause early lung toxicity in animals, but the agency noted that the \"potential for people to inhale graphene particles from face masks and the related health risks are not yet known, and may vary based on mask design.\" Health Canada has asked distributors in Canada to stop selling graphene masks while it investigates the safety of using graphene in masks, and advised that people who have used graphene face masks and \"have health concerns, or symptoms such as new or unexplained shortness of breath, discomfort or difficulty breathing,\" to consult with their healthcare provider. For examples of graphene masks sold in the U.S., sign in and read the full answer. Standards for masks ASTM International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), has published voluntary standards for non-medical cloth face masks. Masks labeled \"Meets ASTM F3502\" must be shown, in an accredited laboratory, to meet one of two designations that will also appear on the mask label: Level 1: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 20% and airflow resistance of < 15 mm H2O Level 2: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 50% and airflow resistance of < 5 mm HH 2 O (For comparison, a NIOSH approved N95 must have an airflow resistance of no more than 35 mm H 2 O). Masks that claim to meet ASTM standards are also required to provide user instructions for size proper selection, proper use, and cleaning or disposal instructions. How cotton and other household fabrics compare in blocking coronavirusdish cloth (85% polyester and 15% nylon) was slightly better -- 97.9%. In addition, most household fabrics were more breathable than the material in a medical mask. The dish cloth, for example, was twice as breathable as the medical mask (Aydin, medRxiv 2020 --preprint). (See the CDC website to learn how to make a cloth face covering.) Tightly woven cotton, combined with silk or chiffon A study at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory found that tightly woven, high-thread count cotton (600 thread-per-inch (TPI) sheet by Wamsutta) was more effective in filtering large droplets (similar to larger-sized SARS-CoV-2 droplets) than loosely woven cotton with a lower thread count (quilters cotton, 80 TPI), while fabrics with an electrostatic charge (such as silk and chiffon) were best for blocking aerosols -- the smaller sized droplets that remain suspended in air for extended amounts of time. Using layers of both fabrics, together, was most effective for blocking both large and small droplets. For example, two layers of 600 TPI cotton fabric had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.5% and 82%, respectively, but one layer of 600 TPI cotton combined with two layers of chiffon (90% polyester, 10% spandex from Jo-Ann Stores) had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.2% and 97% -- which, at low airflow rates (i.e., when not all air is drawn through the mask) is nearly as good as a properly-fitted N95 mask for blocking large particles and better than the N-95 with respect to small particles, of which only 85% are blocked by an N-95 mask). However, as emphasized in a published correction to the study, it is not known how efficient this fabric combination will be at normal or high rates of airflow when made into a fitted mask, i.e., when there are no leaks and all air flows directly through the mask, particularly when one is engaged in high levels of exertion. The researchers also found that small holes or leaks around the edges of the fabrics could decrease the blocking efficacy by 50% or more, and emphasized the importance of a good fit (snug and without gaps) (Konda, ACS Nano 2020). [Note: An illustration in the study shows the electrostatic layer of fabric as the inner layer when fabrics were combined. However, ConsumerLab contacted the author of the study who suggested that electrostatic fabric (such as chiffon) may be best used as the outer layer of the mask to avoid humidity from the nose or mouth, which could interfere with the electrostatic properties, but emphasized that was his suggestion, not something that was tested in the study.] Cotton bandanas and handkerchiefs In another study, researchers at Florida Atlantic University tested masks made from common household fabrics, as well a typical \"cone\" mask (often sold at pharmacies) to see how well they worked to stop droplets using a simulated model of coughing (a mannequin head through which liquid was manually pumped). Without any covering, droplets from the simulated cough traveled an average of 8 feet. With a bandana (single-layer, elastic T-shirt material, 85 threads per inch) droplets traveled an average of 3 ft. 7 inches, with a folded cotton handkerchief (as shown in this instructional video featuring the U.S. Surgeon General), 1 ft. 3 inches, and with a cone mask (CVS Cone Face Mask), 8 inches. The most effective mask was a stitched cotton mask (using two-layers of cotton quilting fabric, 70 threads per inch), with which droplets traveled just 2.5 inches. The researchers noted that \"healthcare professionals trained properly in the use of high-quality fitted masks will not experience leakage to the extent that we have observed in this study. However, leakage remains a likely issue for members of the general public who often rely on loose-fitting homemade masks.\" (Verma, Phys Fluids 2020). Polypropylene and surgical masks Rather than focus on how far droplets travel, researchers at Duke looked at how well different masks block droplets during speaking. A fitted N95 mask without a valve was most effective in retaining droplets, with less than 1% of droplets being transmitted. The next most effective, in order, were a 3-layer surgical mask, a cotton-polypropylene-cotton \"apron\" mask, a 2-layer polypropylene mask, a 2-layer cotton pleated mask, and then an N95 with a valve. Neck gaiters (fleece, microfiber & polyester) The Duke researchers found that two masks offered little protection: A double-layer bandana was only slightly more effective than using no face covering at all, while the worst face covering was a \"gaiter\" style neck fleece (often worn during running or sports) that showed a 10% increase in the number of droplets. The researchers suggested that the neck fleece material breaks larger liquid droplets into smaller droplets than can more easily be dispersed into the air (Fischer, Sci Adv 2020 \u2014 includes photos of the masks but no details about origin or brands). However, tests conducted by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute found that, when measuring droplets that dispersed in an outward direction at a distance of about 1 ft. (30 cm), neck gaiters (one made of thin, 100% polyester (Chaos) and the other, a thicker, microfiber gaiter made of 87% polyester and 13% elastane (Cirque)) worked as well as a cloth mask (a no-sew mask made of cotton T-shirt material), blocking 100% of larger droplets (> 20 microns), 90% of droplets 5 microns in size, and 50% of 0.5 micron aerosols. They were somewhat less efficient than the cloth mask at blocking smaller aerosols, although when the thinner gaiter was doubled over, it blocked about 90% of droplets and aerosols (0.5 to 5 microns) (Pan, Virginia Tech PDF 2020). When doubled over, some neck gaiters may be more effective than a triple layer, all-cotton cloth mask. A study conducted by researchers at the CDC and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), found that a single-layer polyester neck gaiter (FKGIONG Sun UV Protection Neck Gaiter, 95% polyester, 5% Spandex) blocked 47% of outward moving cough aerosols (ranging in size from 0 to 7 microns) and when doubled over, blocked 60%. This was slightly better than a medical procedure mask with ear loops, which blocked 59% and a cloth mask made of 3 layers of cotton fabric and ear loops (Hanes Defender), which blocked 51%. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (Lindsley, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). It should be noted that the cotton cloth mask tested did not have an outer layer made of hydrophobic material (such as polypropylene or polyester) as recommended by WHO. If wearing a neck gaiter, make sure it fits securely and consider choosing one with an adjustable cord, to help prevent it from falling down (off of the nose and mouth) during strong sudden movements, such as during a sneeze. Which masks protect you best? A study that evaluated how well masks protect the wearer from breathing in small particles (ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.6 microns) and factored in the fit of the mask as well as its filtration efficiency found that a NIOSH approved N95 (3M 9210) had the highest filtration efficiency at 98%, followed by 80% for a medical procedure mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health) with nylon hosiery placed over it, and 71.5% for a surgical mask with ties. [Note: The filtration efficiency of the medical procedure masks can range dramatically depending on how it was worn.] The filtration efficiency was 74% for a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops (Easy Masks LLC) with an aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert which, interestingly, had a slightly higher filtration efficiency after being washed once, 49.9% for a folded, cotton bandana, 39.3% for a single-layer woven polyester\/nylon mask with ties (Renfro Corporation), 37.8% for a single-layer woven gaiter\/neck cover balaclava bandana MPUSA LLC), 28.6% for a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops (Red Devil Inc), and just 26.5% for a 3-layer woven cotton mask (100% cotton) with ear loops (Hanesbrands Inc) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020). Best Materials for Making Your Own Mask Filter As discussed above, the WHO recommends that the middle layer of a cloth mask be made of a synthetic, nonwoven fabric such as polypropylene, or a second layer of cotton (high thread count cotton has been shown to have better filtration efficacy than lower-thread cotton). Many cloth masks that you can buy online come with a \"filter pocket\" as the middle layer, which you can buy pre-made filters for, or add your own. We've reviewed common materials for making mask filters, including Filti Face Mask Material and Medline Dry Baby Wipes, as well as materials such as polypropylene and other non woven fabrics (100% polypropylene, Pellon Sew-In Interfacing and Oly*fun), cotton and quilter's cotton.

How Cloth, N95, KN95 and other Masks Compare As noted above, well-constructed cloth masks may reduce your risk of exposure to virus-containing particles, but their main purpose is to help protect others from potentially infectious particles that you may emit. They generally do not provide the same level of protection to the wearer as N95 or KN95 respirators. The extent to which cloth masks can filter particles (filtration efficiency) can vary widely depending on the type of fabrics used, the number of layers, and the fit. Cloth masks are also not held to the same standards as N95 and KN95 respirators, as they do not have to be tested by a government agency or meet standardized criteria in order to be sold. If you choose a cloth mask, be sure to it meets basic CDC and WHO guidelines. You can also look for cloth masks that has been tested and shown to meet voluntary ASTM standards. A cloth mask that has received a \"Level 2\" designation has been shown to have a particulate filtration efficiency \"of at least 50%.\" In comparison, NIOSH approved particulate N95 respirators have been tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the U.S. CDC. They must meet certain minimum criteria, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, an inhalation resistance of < 25 mm H20 and an exhalation resistance of <35 mm H20 (these are measures of how difficult is to breath in and out while wearing the respirator). Unlike cloth masks, NIOSH approved N95s are also required to attach to the head with head straps, rather than ear loops, as head straps can provide a more secure fit and reduce gapping. KN95 respirators, the Chinese \"equivalent\" of N95 respirators, must meet similar standards, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, and limits for inhalation and exhalation resistance. They are not required to have head straps (most have ear loops), although some do. Be aware that, during the pandemic, there have been many reports of counterfeit KN95s sold in the U.S., so you need to be careful where you buy KN95s. (For more about the differences between N95s and KN95s and quality concerns, see Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s?). Sign in to see CL's Reviews of Popular N95 Respirators. Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy If you prefer to purchase a cloth mask, we reviewed many masks sold online and identified several that we believe best meet WHO guidelines and\/or are constructed with materials that offer a good combination of filtration efficacy and breathability. We also considered features that can affect fit and comfort, such as adjustable\/bendable nose wires and adjustable straps, which can be particularly important for people who wear glasses or hearing aids. We also reviewed oversized masks designed to accommodate beards or to be used when singing, and masks with clear panels to enable lip reading by others. In addition, we assessed eyeglass fogging with each mask when worn in cool air. Our list starts with our overall Top Pick for quality, comfort and breathability, fit, and minimal eyeglass fogging. This is followed by our next favorites, as well as masks for those who need clear panels. In our review of masks, we considered those from Allet, Atelier, Giftington, Graf Lanzt, LA Linen, Proper Cloth, Rafi Nova, Stark's, Tom Bihn, Vertex, Vida, Vistaprint, and masks sold on Etsy. Be aware that there is a shipping fee for most masks, calculated before check out based on location and\/or other factors. Most companies provide an estimated time for the product to ship, but delivery time will depend on the shipping option you choose. ConsumerLab.com derives no revenue from sales of these products. (To see our list of the best cloth masks you can buy, sign in. If you are not a ConsumerLab member, join now.) How to reduce air leakage around a mask Air leakage around a mask reduces the level of protection it provides you and those around you. There are several ways to reduce air leakage, as discussed below. Also be aware that if you are infectious, the area of your face beyond a leak, including eyeglasses, may become contaminated due to exhaled droplets, as demonstrated in OSHA study (Stephenson, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Knotting ear loops The fit and filtration efficiency of medical procedure masks with ear loops can be significantly improved by knotting the ear loops and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (see illustration), according to research conducted on manikins by the CDC. This was shown to reduce exposure to aerosols from a cough by 64.5%. Double masking Wearing a medical mask (i.e., a blue \"procedure\" mask) under a cloth mask improves protection, (likely by minimizing leaks between the medical mask and skin), but wearing a medical mask over a cloth mask has less benefit. A study found that wearing a medical mask under a cloth mask increased the filtration efficiency of cloth masks (which, alone, were 41 to 44% efficient), as well as medical masks (which, alone, were 43 to 62% efficient). Adding a medical mask beneath a cloth mask increased fitted filtration efficiencies to 66% for a simple cotton ear-loop mask, 77% for a cotton bandana, and 81% for a gaiter. Doubling a medical mask was not as effective, nor was doubling cloth masks \u2014 which also reduced breathability (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2021). Nose wires Be aware that, while adding a nose wire to masks can improve their fit (and therefore, possibly reduce air leakage and improve protection). They seem to be of benefit with stiffer masks but; but not with masks made with stretchy or more flexible material (O'Kelly, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Try not to bend over while wearing a mask Researchers at Columbia University who were fit testing N95 respirators found that normal breathing and talking did not negatively affect mask fit, and turning the head from side to side slightly improved fit (perhaps due to tightening). However, moving the head up and down slightly worsened fit, and bending over decreased proper fit by as much as 50%. The researchers suggested kneeling rather than bending over when wearing a mask (Chen, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). Mask fitters Masks fitters are a \"frame\" that can be placed over masks to improve the fit and \"seal\" of the mask against the face to reduce air leakage and increase inhalation filtration efficiency. Using mannequins that could \"breathe,\" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that placing either of two marketed mask fitters over a variety of masks increased inhalation filtration efficiencies from just 7% without the fitter to 26% for a 4-ply cotton mask, from 52% to 63% for a 3-ply spunbond polypropylene mask, from 44% to 91% for a surgical mask, and from only 18% up to as much as 95% for a 3-ply disposable non-medical mask with a melt-blown polypropylene center. Sign in to learn make a mask fitter at home or buy either of the two used in the study. Nylon stockings Another way to reduce air leaks was suggested by a study at Northeastern University in Boston, which showed that pulling an 8 to 10-inch tube of nylon (cut from a queen-sized nylon stocking) down over a regular mask and to the top of the neck. This significantly prevented air leakage around the mask and improved particle filtration efficiency, making the combined masking nearly as effective as an N-95 respirator which, unlike a medical mask, has an electrostatic charge and is specifically designed to prevent air leakage (Mueller, medRxiv 2020 --preprint; Godoy, NPR.org 4\/22\/20). Similarly, a study found that adding a sleeve of nylon hosiery over a medical procedural mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health Inc) increased its overall filtration efficiency from just 38.5% to 80%. Other techniques that created a better fit for the procedure mask to reduce air leakage included tying the ear loops and tucking in the side pleats (see video demonstration), which increased filtration efficiency to 60.3%, or securing the ear loops with ear guards (61.7%), a hair clip (64.8%) or placing three rubber bands across the front of the mask and looped on the ears (78.2%) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020). How to reduce eyeglass fogging from masks Our tests indicated that eyeglasses were less likely to fog in cool air with masks that 1) came up higher on the nose and cheeks (allowing glasses to sit over the edge of the mask 2) had a bendable top frame that could be contoured for a close fit around the nose and cheeks, 3) had adjustable ear or head bands, allowing the mask to be tight against the face, and 4) had an outer layer of 100% polyester or chiffon rather than a cotton or cotton\/polyester blend. Find out which masks had the least fogging. Lens fogging may also be minimized by rinsing lenses with highly diluted liquid soap and then air drying (stand lenses up so excess drips off) (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). This leaves a surfactant film that reduces surface tension and causes water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer, reducing fogging (Margrain, Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2011). Anti-fogging sprays and wipes are also sold, but be sure to follow directions and allow liquids to dry before wearing to avoid eye irritation or injury from the liquid. (A CL member reported severe eye irritation after using JAWS Spit Gel which seems to have gotten into his eye after a COVID nasal test that caused eye tearing) (Peng, Cornea 2006). Eye injury has also been reported in healthcare workers in China who used anti-fog spray on medical goggles (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). Single-sided and double-sided tape strips can also be used to seal the edges of masks around the eyes and nose to reduce fogging. ConsumerLab purchased two tape strip products sold on Amazon, MaskTite Adhesive Strips and Cabeau Tape. We tried each with the masks in this review, and with a disposable mask, while wearing glasses. [Sign in to see our reviews of these tapes and our mask reviews.] How to clean a cloth mask The CDC advises that cloth masks be washed daily (and after high exposure) with soap and water. The agency also suggests each person have at least two cloth masks, likely so that one can be used while the other is being cleaned. It notes that \"cloth can be used for an extended period as long as they are not wet or soiled, but do not reuse them unless washed and cleaned.\" Masks should not be worn while still wet, as the agency states that the filtration effectiveness may be reduced. The FDA recommends choosing a cloth mask that can be washed and machine dried without damage or change in shape. Cloth masks can be washed in a washing machine. They can also be cleaned using heat, but a washing machine is preferred. Silk and chiffon fabrics may need to be hand washed with cold water. If you've purchased a mask, check with the fabric manufacturer or see the care instructions on the label. If hand washing is required, be sure to use adequate soap\/detergent and rinse thoroughly, as soap helps to break down the lipid layer that allows SARS-Cov-2 to attach to surfaces. Some sturdier silk and chiffon blends, such as poly-spandex-chiffon, can be machine washed with warm water and tumbled dry if placed in a mesh bag for delicates. Re-using N95s? Currently, the CDC recommends re-using a single N95 respirator no more than five times. It also advises healthcare workers \"wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs,\" noting that this \"will provide some time for pathogens on it to \"die off\" during storage.\" A study of 3M N95 respirators (dome-shaped duckbill models) worn by healthcare workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital caring for COVID-19 patients found that all N95s worn less than 12 times (and stored between uses) passed seal check and fit testing. Even when used about 40 times, 83% still passed these tests. The study implied that the masks had not been subject to decontamination procedures but they may have been somewhat protected from pathogen contamination as they were typically worn with face shields (Fabre, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). Preventing mask-related skin irritation and acne Keeping masks clean can also help prevent skin irritation, acne, and other skin conditions that can be caused by or exacerbated by wearing a mask, including eczema (contact dermatitis), rosacea, and folliculitis (inflammation\/infection of hair follicles). Although the term \"maskne\" has become a common term to describe skin irritation and eruptions after wearing masks, contact dermatitis appears to be the most common skin irritation associated with wearing masks. All of these conditions can be aggravated by humidity within the mask, increased bacterial load on the skin, and friction from mask material. In addition to replacing and\/or cleaning masks regularly, dermatologists recommend applying light moisturizer 30 minutes before putting on your mask and maintaining good oral hygiene to help minimize the risk of skin irritation. You can find more information and the full list of tips for skin care when wearing masks in this article (see \"General measures to prevent PPE related facial dermatoses\") (Rud, BMJ 2021). Effect on breathing function and potential carbon dioxide buildup When wearing an N95 respirator or a well-fitted mask with high blocking efficiency there can be some carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask over time (Sinkule, Ann Occup Hyg 2013). According to researchers at Stanford University, N95 masks are \"are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That's significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\" However, a small study in the U.S. found that wearing an N-95 mask for up to one hour did not cause any significant adverse effects in healthy healthcare workers performing moderate activities, despite significantly decreased inhaled oxygen and increased inhaled carbon dioxide levels (Roberge, Respir Care 2010). A representative from the CDC told Reuters.com that \"...the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia [elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide].\" On the other hand, surgical masks (also known as medical masks), which are inherently not as well-fitting as N95 respirators, do not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency, as noted by the World Health Organization. Several studies have demonstrated this. For example, a study among 20 healthy adults showed that moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill) for one hour while wearing a surgical mask led to only slight, clinically non-significant changes in CO2 levels (as measured on the skin) compared to exercise without a mask (Respir Physiol Neurobiol 2012). Even during vigorous exercise (cycling to exhaustion, an average of about 10 minutes) a study among 14 healthy men and women showed that wearing a disposable surgical mask or a three-layer cloth mask (Washable 3D Face Mask, TriMax Sports Inc. \u2014 made with bamboo charcoal cloth, non-woven fabric, and Lycra) had no effect on blood or muscle oxygenation or exercise performance compared exercising without a mask (Shaw, Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020). Furthermore, a study of 10 healthcare workers (including individuals with controlled asthma and four smokers), found that wearing a surgical mask (AFLUID, made of three layers of polypropylene and one layer of liquid resistant polyethylene) continuously for four hours did not reduce breathing function (Ciocan, Med Lav 2020). Additionally, older adults who wore a three-layer disposable nonmedical face mask with ear loops (Boomcare DY95 model, Deyce Leather Co Ltd) for one hour showed no decline in self-reported blood oxygen levels (as measured by pulse oximeter) (Chan, JAMA 2020). Another study showed that, even among older adults (average age 71) with breathing difficulty due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wearing a surgical mask during a six-minute walk test did not result in any major changes in CO2 retention (Samannan, Ann Am Thorac Soc 2020). The researchers suggested that discomfort while wearing a surgical mask might be caused by the increased warmth of facial skin and inhaled air inside the mask, which may trigger sensations of anxiety or claustrophobia in some people. The CDC advises that face masks should not be placed on children under the age of two, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who would not be able to remove the mask without assistance. Inhalation of microplastics and OPEs Concern has been raised about the risk of inhaling microplastic particles when wearing a mask made of polypropylene or other materials containing plastics. A study in China found that most masks increased the inhalation of fiber-like microplastics but notably decreased the risk of inhalation of spherical particles. While some evidence has suggested that fiber-like microplastics may be more toxic to animals than spherical microplastics (Ziajahromi, Environ Sci Technol 2017), the investigators concluded that, overall, inhalation of microplastics from masks is a small problem compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19 without a mask, as people already regularly inhale high amounts of microplastics from the air, with or without a face mask. The study found that only N95 respirators reduced the risk of inhaling fiber-like microplastic particles compared to not wearing a mask, while a nonwoven mask, a fashion mask, and a cotton mask increased it by 17%, 41%, and 54%, respectively, surgical masks increased it by about 4% to 73%, and activated charcoal mask increased it by 117%. Inhalation of spherical microplastic particles was reduced by about 47% to 96% for all masks compared to not wearing a mask. Disinfecting any of the masks with UV irradiation, alcohol, air blower treatment, washing with soap and water, or exposure to sunlight increased the microplastic inhalation risk compared to untreated masks, although the risk was only small following washing with water and was lowest following exposure to sunlight. Alcohol disinfection increased the risk of microplastic inhalation most significantly (Li J Hazard Mater 2020). Polypropylene and other plastic materials used to make KN95 respirators, medical, surgical and other types of masks are often treated with organophosphate esters (OPEs) which, at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure to OPEs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact have been linked with cancer and other adverse effects. Sign in to the full answer to see what researchers found when they looked at the risk of inhaling OPEs when wearing masks. Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s? N95 and KN95 masks (or, more technically, respirators) are designed to protect you, as well as others around you. Both are supposed to filter 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns. However, as discussed below, this isn't always the case with widely sold KN95 masks (which are designed to meet Chinese, rather than U.S. specifications). In addition, while N95 respirators attach with head bands to help ensure the best fit, most KN95s attach with ear loops, which may cause a loose or improper fit, and allow for air leakage. A study of N95 and KN95 respirators have shown that mask performance depends, in part, on the tightness of the contact between the material and the facial skin and masks that tied around the head outperform those with elastic ear loops (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2020). As discussed above, how you move while wearing a mask may also affect fit. Nevertheless, due to the previous shortage of N95 masks, in April 2020 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provided guidance that KN95 masks certified to China's GB2636 standards of 2006 or 2019 (imprinted on masks as \"GB2626-2006\" or \"GB2626-2019\") \"will provide greater protection than surgical masks (i.e., facemasks, other than surgical N95s[3]), homemade masks, or improvised mouth and nose covers, such as bandanas and scarves.\" Caution: You should not buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it. Tests of KN95s from China by the CDC show that the filtration efficacy of some KN95 masks is 95% or higher but can be as low as 5.3%. Furthermore, tests by ECRI, an independent, U.S. based non-profit organization that evaluates equipment for hospitals and healthcare systems, showed that 5 of 11 KN95s did not meet the filtration efficiency standard of 95%. ECRI also found large variations in filtration efficiencies of KN95s within the same lot from a single manufacturer, suggesting quality control issues. (You can download ECRI's test results, which includes manufacturer information and photos of the respirators tested by clicking on \"PPE Testing Report\" on this page on ECRI's site). Buying a KN95 Starting in 2020, the FDA published and maintained a list of N-95 and KN95 respirators from China given emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA during the pandemic. However, as of July 6, 2021, due to the increased supply and availability of NIOSH-approved respirators, the FDA has revoked its authorization of non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China for healthcare workers. Respirators with previous EUA status may still be marketed to the general public, but must be labeled as face masks, rather than respirators. Update: On August 25, 2021, the FDA announced that federal approval of respirators made by particular manufacturer has been revoked due to concerns about the quality of the products. Sign in for the details. Finding the Best KN95 Mask N95 masks are currently very hard to find and purchase as they remain reserved for healthcare and frontline workers. In contrast, KN95 masks are widely available for purchase on websites such as Amazon. However, it can be very difficult to know if a KN95 mask is genuine and effective. We reviewed many KN95 masks sold on Amazon but found only one currently on the FDA's list of authorized respirators that we recommend, and we found two that should be avoided. We also found an FDA-authorized KN95 through an online direct distributor in the U.S. The CDC publishes a list and images of dozens of counterfeit and falsely marketed respirators. Signs of a counterfeit respirator include no approval number or NIOSH markings, decorative fabrics or add-ons, and claims of being approved for children. Other respirators Before N95 respirators became more available, the United States Department of Labor, noted that healthcare workers who were unable to obtain N95 respirators could use R95, R99, P95, P99, P100 and others respirators. Like N95 masks, these are expected to filter out a minimum of 95% of particles of the most penetrating size, and those ending in a \"99\" or \"100\" filter out at least 99% or 99.97%, respectively, of such particles but can be more difficult to breathe through. R95 and P95 masks are typically used for protection when working with oil-based substances like fuel, paints, solvents, or pesticides. N95s are not resistant to oil, R95s are \"somewhat resistant\" and P95s are \"strongly resistant to oil or oil proof,\" as shown in the CDC's infographic about these types of masks. If considering an alternative respirator, make sure it is NIOSH approved. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when trying to protect others. (See a video demonstration by researchers at Florida Atlantic University of how aerosols can spread when coughing while wearing an N95 mask with a valve). KF94 respirators from Korea are often promoted as the Korean \"equivalent\" to N95 respirators, but this is not quite accurate. Although they can have relatively high filtration efficacy, KF94 masks are considered \"public use\" respirators and are not held to the same performance standards as Korea's Special 1st class \"occupational use\" respirators (which are considered to be roughly equivalent to NIOSH approved N95 masks). KF94 respirators are designed to have a filtration efficacy of 94%, and CDC tests of one brand of KF94 found its filtration efficacy to be even higher (99.85 to 99.94%). However, unlike all NIOSH-approved N95s (which attach with head bands), KF94 respirators attach with ear loops, which, the CDC points out, may compromise their fit and efficacy. The CDC did not perform fit testing on the KF94s it tested and noted a lack of information about manufacturing quality control. In addition, unlike surgical N95 respirators, KF94 respirators are not considered fluid resistant (Kim, J Korean Med Sci 2020). Electrical air purifying respirators that mimic powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are available on Amazon, ranging in price from about $60 to $100, but these devices would not be suitable for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. These devices include a portable high efficiency (HE) filter that can be connected to a face mask via a flexible hose\/air duct to supply fresh air to the wearer. By ventilating air from the HE filter to the mask, these devices should create positive air pressure. This means that air exhaled by the wearer would leak out of the mask. Consequently, these devices might protect the wearer if the ventilation is strong enough, but they would not protect individuals nearby the wearer. Furthermore, unlike NIOSH-certified PAPRs, which are rated as being more effective than N-95 masks, available electrical air purifying respirators do not appear to be certified. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices even help protect the wearer. In addition, similar to other personal (\"wearable\") air purifiers, these devices might not be permitted on airplanes, as security officers can confiscate these devices if they feel they are unsafe or cause a threat. Are copper masks better? Copper has been shown to inactivate a wide variety of bacteria and some viruses, typically within minutes to hours of contact, and a study found that SARS-CoV-2 (at about 72\u00b0F and 40% relative humidity) was undetectable on copper after four hours (van Dormalen, NEJM (correspondence) 2020). There do not appear to be studies showing how effective masks made with copper or copper infused fabric are against SARS-Cov-2. However, preliminary research with other viruses suggests a possible benefit. A study funded by the maker of copper masks (Cupron) for healthcare and institutional use, showed that an N95 mask with two added layers of copper oxide infused material (polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight\/weight copper particles) had a similar filtering efficacy as a regular N95 mask, but was much more effective in inactivating human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) (Barkow, PLoS One 2010). A University of Massachusetts Amherst microbiologist developed a reusable mask made of 99.95% pure copper mesh, which, according to a university news release, was shown to \"kill 90% of microbes within five minutes of contact.\" In Hong Kong, the government is distributing fabric masks to the public that contain copper, known as the CuMask+ (Parry, BMJ 2020). According to the manufacturer, CuMask+ is made up six layers, \"two of which are specially made with small quantities of copper.\" Tests published by the company suggest it retains antiviral activity with up to 60 washes (handwashed with soap and cold water). If you use a copper-containing mask, be sure to clean it regularly and according to the product instructions: Bacteria and viruses can cling to dirt or other particles on copper, making it less effective (Grass, Appl Environ Microbiol 2011). Some concerns have been raised about the safety of copper masks and the possibility of breathing in copper particles. While we don't have safety information for specific products, laboratory studies that measured the amount of copper released from copper oxide impregnated masks during 5 hours under simulated breathing conditions was far below the respiratory copper permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by the USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") (Borkow, Curr Chem Biol 2012). How to protect yourself from COVID-19 in a car Preliminary research suggests that viral loads can quickly build up within a closed car, even during rides as brief as 15 minutes. Wearing a mask, as well as a face shield, are good first steps to help protect yourself and others. When there are two people in a car (one driver and one passenger) seating the passenger in the back seat on the opposite side of the driver creates the most distance between them. To increase ventilation, computer modeling research shows that riding with all windows down is most effective. Since this isn't always practical, the next most effective way to increase ventilation is by opening one window in the back and one in the front, opposite of where the occupants sit, creating airflow across the interior of the car. Keeping all the windows closed and running the air-conditioning, is least effective (Mathai, Sci Adv 2020). Keep in mind that none of these steps eliminate the risk of infection. How to improve safety for bus passengers and drivers A study of aerosol flow on a school bus and transit bus that were driven under real-world conditions showed that mask wearing and ventilation can significantly reduce exposure to aerosols for passengers (Edwards, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Based on their experiments, the researchers recommended the following tips to help reduce exposure to aerosols for bus passengers: Require all passengers and drivers to wear masks on buses. Even a cloth mask that's 50% efficient can reduce particles released from a cough by 50% and reduce their dispersal by several feet. Open windows partially or fully. This can reduce airborne particles by 50% to 80%. Consider seating arrangements that only allow for same household or same cohort passengers to sit together. Social distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses, but any extra distance allows the air movement to reduce exposure to infectious particles. For bus drivers, the researchers recommended risk could be reduced by using a dashboard fan to create airflow in the driver seat area. They also noted that, when safe to do so, opening all transit bus doors at every stop would allow for better air exchange. What masks protect against wildfire smoke? Cloth masks, including those with sewn-in or removable filters, should not be relied on for protection from wildfire smoke, according to the CDC. They protect against some of the larger particles in wildfire smoke, but not from smaller particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. In addition, one-strap paper dust masks and surgical masks, worn alone, are not recommended for wildfire smoke protection. It is recommended that people who have to be outdoors in wildfire affected areas wear fit-tested, NIOSH-approved N95 or P100 respirators, and the CDC notes that properly fitted N95 respirators can \"provide protection from wildfire smoke and from COVID-19 for the individuals wearing them.\" To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others, N95 masks without valves are recommended. If an N95 mask with a valve is your only option for wildfire smoke protection, consider covering the valve with tape or wearing a surgical mask over the N95 when around others, as recommended by John Balms, M.D. at UCSF. According to the CDC, KN95 respirators can also provide protection from wildfire smoke, and advises looking for a KN95 that meets requirements similar to those set by the CDC's NIOSH (see our Top Pick among KN95 masks, which was tested by the CDC).",

        "text":"Answer: Before we get into specifics, let's start with a quick overview of the types of tests for coronavirus. Types of COVID-19 Tests There are basically two types of tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19: Virus test This test detects the virus (SARS-CoV-2) to help determine if you have a current infection. Although you can be infectious before showing any symptoms, the virus is best detected during the first week of symptoms (which is about two weeks after becoming infected from exposure) (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). There are two type of virus tests: the PCR and antigen test. Early in the pandemic, both tests had to be performed in a laboratory or clinic with special rapid, portable machines, but rapid, home-based PCR and antigen tests have become available. There are also at-home sampling kits by which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report PCR results back to you. Virus tests are typically done by collecting a sample of mucous from a nose swab (typically from the nasopharynx or nostril) or saliva or oral swabs. There is some evidence that virus detection may be better with samples from saliva or the mouth or throat (Blythe, medRxiv 2021 \u2014 preprint; Wyllie, Correspondence in JAMA, 2020), but most tests (and all antigen tests) authorized for use in the U.S. rely on samples from the nose and the FDA has advised against using antigen tests designed for the nose to be used in the mouth. Nevertheless, a study in the Netherlands, showed that an antigen test (BD Veritor) was able to detect about 20% more positive cases using samples collected first from the throat (around the tonsils) and then from the nose than with samples just from the nose. The combined samples were also used on Roche's SD Biosensor (aka COVI9-19 At-Home Test) antigen test which was even more accurate than BD Veritor (Zwart, medRxiv 2022 -- preprint). (Interestingly, one antigen test in the UK utilizes a swab of the throat (tonsils) that is then used to swab one nostril.) An apparent benefit of sampling from the throat is that the virus appears at higher levels there about a day earlier than in the nose, although levels then rise higher in the nose and remain higher there for a longer period, as shown in a study of people in the UK given COVID-19 by being infected with virus in their nose (Killingly, In Review 2022 -- preprint). Using only a swab from the inside of the check, however, was shown to identify only 2 positive cases out of 22 that were positive with nostril swabs in a small study that used the Abbott BinaxNow antigen test (Schrom, medRxiv 2022 \u2014 preprint). The PCR test uses a technique that amplifies genetic material (RNA) from the virus. This can take as little as a few minutes or several hours. The FDA has authorized at-home sampling kits with which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report the results back to you. It has also authorized at-home PCR tests that take about 20 to 60 minutes. Home PCR tests are more expensive than home antigen tests but may detect infections earlier than antigen tests. (Sign in to see our reviews of home PCR tests from Cue, Detect, and Lucira, and to see our Top Pick among these.) An analysis of tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that the proportion of samples testing positive on PCR tests were twice as high at 2 pm than in the morning, decreasing later in the afternoon and evening. Researchers proposed this may indicate that test accuracy varies by time of day and could have public health implications (McNaughton, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Update: In addition to the many commercial PCR tests that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the CDC has been producing its own, FDA-authorized, PCR test. More recently, the CDC developed a newer test that can simultaneously test for and distinguish between COVID, influenza A and influenza B, and, as of January 1, 2022, it will withdraw the older test. Sign in to find out why. The antigen test identifies a protein (or \"antigen\") that is specifically found on the virus. Advantages of the antigen test are that it can provide results in as little as 15 minutes and can be produced at lower cost, lending itself to wider use in screening. In addition, only a nasal swab is needed from the nostrils, not a much deeper, nasopharyngeal swab. The downside with antigen tests is that they are more likely to provide a false negative result than a gene amplification test; that is, it's more likely to identify your sample as negative when you are actually positive. Consequently, negative results from an antigen test should be repeated within three days, but at least 36 hours later (or confirmed with a PCR test) for people who are at high-risk of infection \u2014 but a positive antigen result is highly likely to be accurate. False negatives may also occur with emerging viral variants, if the variants have significant mutations of the target antigen. However, most popular antigen tests in the U.S. target nucleocapsid antigen, which is still present in variants such as Delta and Omicron. Be aware of a common mistake made when reading rapid home antigen tests and that one of the chemicals in these tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled. Sign in for details about benefits and limitations of rapid antigen testing for the Omicron variant and find out how likely are you to still be contagious if you test positive on a rapid antigen test after a 5-day isolation. Be aware that one of the chemicals home antigen tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled. Several home antigen tests have been authorized by the FDA and are available, such as Abbott BinaxNow Self Test, BD Veritor, CLINITEST, Flowflex, iHealth, InteliSwab, On\/Go (AccessBio CareStart), Roche At-Home, and Quidel QuickVue. However, there important differences in the accuracy of these tests, their shelf-lives and stability in freezing temperatures, and their cost. Also, versions of some of these tests have been recalled. [Sign in for our comparison of antigen tests and our Top Picks.] Antibody test This test detects antibodies to the virus and requires blood \u2014 either a drop or a vial \u2014 to determine if you have been infected in the past and have developed some level of immunity. This test (also called a serology test) can be run in a laboratory or on a test strip, although even test strips must be used in an authorized facility, not at home. As it takes time to develop antibodies that can be detected, antibody tests are most accurate when performed at least 20 days after the first disease symptoms and may be most accurate (in terms of not missing antibodies that are present) 4 months or longer after a positive virus test. This was shown in study of 486 COVID patients in California in which the likelihood of a positive antibody (IgG) test result increased with time after a positive virus test. Antibody tests were most accurate (~80%) among those ages 40 to 59 years and least accurate (~65%) among those 70+ or under 40. The tests were more accurate for men than women (79% vs 72%) (Vashisht, JAMA Netw Open 2021). Tests focus on levels of the antibody IgG, which persists without much decline for several weeks, but may include levels of IgM which fall off more rapidly (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). These tests look for antibodies to specific parts of the virus, namely its spike proteins (proteins on the outside of the virus that can bind to receptors on human cells) or nucleocapsid proteins (proteins inside the virus). An advantage to testing for antibodies to the nucleocapsid is that these antibodies can be easier to detect, however, antibodies to the spike proteins are believed to be more important in conferring immunity against the virus, as these antibodies may block viral entry into cells \u2014 although antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins may still serve as proxies for immunity. See Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test to learn which marketed tests target each protein. Although it is not recommended that antibody tests be relied upon to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, be aware that only tests that focus on antibodies to spike protein would be useful for this purpose because the authorized vaccines generate antibodies only to spike proteins. A negative result on a nucleocapsid antibody test provides no information about the effectiveness of a vaccine although it would suggest that a person has not had COVD-19. The list of authorized antibody tests below indicates whether a test focuses on spike, nucleocapsid, or both types of proteins. If, at some point, tests for spike protein antibodies are indicated for assessing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, those that provide a quantitative or semi-quantitative measurement, will be more useful than those that provide only a yes\/no answer. Sign in for more information about antibody tests that focus on the spike protein and are semi-quantitative, including one that is available from a major U.S. laboratory. Note: Avoid taking large doses \u2014 10,000 mcg or more \u2014 of biotin (a B vitamin) for several days before an antibody test, as biotin may skew results. Sign in to learn which tests may be affected by biotin. Another way our bodies fight the virus is with T cells. Preliminary research suggests that even if antibody levels are too low to be detected, people previously infected with the virus may produce enough T cell response to provide immunity (Sekine, MediRxiv 2020). However, currently authorized tests do not measure this type of immunity, and one should still apply distancing and health precautions regardless of test results. Some labs may provide you with an index value that reflects the strength of the antibody signal produced from your test. Higher antibody levels generate higher signals and higher index values. The interpretation of these index values depends on the test used. For example, for a particular test the cut-offs could be \"less than 1.01\" for negative, \"1.01 to less than 1.21\" for indeterminate, and \"greater than or equal to 1.21\" for positive (Theel, J Clin Microbio 2020). Or, there could just be a single cut-off index value of, say, 1.40 for positive, with anything below being negative (Example: Abbott Alinity -- https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/137910\/download). If you would like to know your index value, be sure to check that the lab you use provides the value. Who is checking these tests? To speed the availability of tests, rather than put these through its normal approval process, the FDA has provided a special emergency use allowance (EUA) for tests that, although imperfect, may be useful at this time. So there are actually no FDA \"approved\" SARS-CoV-2 virus tests, but a list of \"FDA authorized\" tests. The FDA allowances are based on data submitted by the test manufacturers, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government laboratories are now conducting independent tests of these tests and the FDA has been making the results public (see results in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section and watch for further announcements in our newsletter.) Several other organizations around the world have been testing the test and\/or certifying virus and antibody tests. The European Union's has been certifying tests, conferring on them its CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark, and the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has been doing the same. Researchers in California, Denmark, and elsewhere have been testing the antibody tests. Be aware that in June 2020 the FDA warned consumers about at-home antibody tests being sold without FDA clearance or approval and issued warning letters to three companies selling these tests. Some of these tests were falsely labeled as FDA approved. [Update (August 19, 2020): The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that CLIA- certified laboratories are no longer required to notify the FDA, nor request its authorization, for tests they develop in-house. It is not clear what information about such tests will be maintained or published. This change could allow for novel tests to become available more quickly but eliminates oversight by the FDA, creating more of a buyer-beware situation. Labs may, voluntarily, still choose to apply to the FDA, and the FDA will continue to publish information about tests submitted this way. If in doubt, ask your doctor or lab if the test you are considering is authorized for use by the FDA. (Links to the FDA information are provided in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section. Where to Get COVID-19 Tests Virus Test To date, the FDA has permitted the use of over 90 virus tests. The vast majority must be performed on a sample collected in a medical setting, such as in a doctor's office, a diagnostic laboratory, or a drive-through facility, but the FDA has also begun authorizing at-home sample collection tests for the virus. Local testing (often free) Although you can ask your doctor for a virus test, you may be able to arrange to get a virus test for free from your state or local government. You can also go to a diagnostic laboratory or testing center, including some pharmacies. The test may be covered by your insurance or the government based on an assessment of your risk level. Here are some examples of testing programs around the country. Project Baseline works with community based screening programs in locations in several states to offer free virus testing. You must fill out an online questionnaire and be accepted. You will then be given an appointment at local testing center where a sample will be collected with a self-nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. The project is sponsored by the parent company of Google through its health unit, Verily, and a Google email account is needed to complete questionnaire online. Rite Aid Pharmacies in some locations are participating in Project Baseline, providing testing at no cost to anyone 18+ years of age. CVS (including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB) had originally offered drive-up, rapid testing using the Abbott ID NOW system, a small, portable device that yields results in 13 minutes or less. Unfortunately, this system was been reported to yield a high percentage of false negative results due to lower sensitivity than other systems. That is, a negative result may need to be confirmed using another test (Basu, bioRxiv 2020 preprint). (For more details, see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test , below). Virus testing is still offered, but specimens are now sent to independent, third-party labs for processing, and test results are available in approximately three to four days. Walgreens offers drive-up testing in which you perform your own nasal swab. You sample is sent to a laboratory and you are notified by email or phone when results are available. (Originally results were promised within 24 hours). Kroger Health offers public drive-thru and walk-up COVID-19 testing. At-home tests The FDA has authorized several fully self-administered virus tests (providing rapid results) or test kits (to be sent into a lab) for use at home. Currently, two of these (Abbott BinaxNOW Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue) can be purchased at pharmacies and take about 15 minutes. Note that these will not provide you with a digital pass for events, airlines, or restaurants. Another version of the BinaxNOW Antigen test (the \"home\" version) provides a digital Navica pass, but this test must be purchased online (at about twice the cost) and many venues may not accept the digital pass. Update: On October 1, 2021, 200,000 test kits of another COVID-19 home test were recalled due to a manufacturing defect causing false positive results (i.e., indicating that someone has COVID-19 when they do not). For details, including what to do if you've used this home test, sign in to the full answer, which also includes details about four other currently available at-home tests. Antibody Test As with virus tests, many laboratories have received FDA approval to conduct antibody tests, some of which are very accurate. Although the FDA has not approved or authorized rapid, home tests for antibodies, many such tests are available in other parts of the world and some have been sold in the U.S. The FDA has authorized one rapid antibody test for use at point-of-care settings, i.e., non-laboratory medical settings such as in medical offices and pharmacies. Through a local healthcare provider Your healthcare provider can arrange for you to get an antibody test if deemed appropriate. Blood would be drawn either by your provider or at nearby diagnostic laboratory. Similarly, many walk-in, urgent care centers can arrange for you to have the test, for a fee, which may be covered by your insurance. The samples are typically sent to a commercial laboratory, so results can take a few days. Consumer-initiated testing Be aware than in many cases, the cost of antibody tests may be covered by insurance if ordered by your physician or health care provider. Some labs will require payment for consumer-initiated tests, while others will bill your insurance. Be sure to check the payment policy of the lab you plan to use if requesting your own test. You can also check if your insurance company covers COVID-19 testing. Medicare often covers the full cost of COVID-19 virus and antibody tests. If you are uninsured, health care providers can submit a claim to have virus and antibody tests covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. QuestDirect allows consumers to request a COVID-19 IgG antibody test and pay for it online ($119 plus a $10.30 physician oversight fee). An appointment is made for a blood draw at one of Quest Diagnostics 2,200 patient service centers and test results are available online one to two days later. Interested consumers must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days. Quest has stated that the testing will initially rely on antibody tests run on the Abbott Architect and EUROIMMUN systems. Labcorp also allows consumers to request a test directly through its website. According to the website, there is no up-front out-of-pocket cost for consumer initiated tests, but you will be charged a $10 fee for physician oversight services (there is no physician oversight fee if the test order comes directly from your own physician or healthcare provider). Labcorp will \"bill the cost of the COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly to your insurance carrier, or if uninsured, to the appropriate government program.\" Antibody tests offered by Labcorp include Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV02 (IgG), and DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2. You can see how each of these tests compare in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section below. Rapid, home tests The FDA has not yet approved or authorized of the use of any rapid, home antibody tests but several have been approved by the European Union, which provides its CE mark (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) and\/or by the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA). In addition, research groups have been evaluating these tests. Some of these tests have been marketed in the U.S. without FDA approval or allowance. Finding the Best COVID-19 Test There are now more than 90 virus tests (including a recently approved saliva test) and 22 antibody tests for COVID-19 authorized by the FDA. ConsumerLab has reviewed the data on their performance and assessed which appear to be the best antibody tests for COVID-19. We've added this information for ConsumerLab members. Sign in as a member or become a member now to learn how specific brands of virus and antibody tests compare, which currently appear to be the best, where to get them, and whether any of the tests can identify which variant caused an infection. What Does a Negative Antibody Test Mean? If you took a coronavirus antibody test and it came back negative, it can mean one of several things: The test was not sensitive enough to detect antibodies that existed. This is more likely if the test had a sensitivity of less than 100% (see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); You may have never had COVID-19; You took the test too early -- generally less than 20 days after first disease symptoms, although, according to the CDC, some people may take longer; or You didn't develop levels of antibodies high enough to be detected by tests -- which preliminary research suggests may happen in mild and asymptomatic cases (Long, Nature Med 2020). There is currently not enough data to know if a negative result could result from taking the test too late. More research is needed to determine how long significant levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist. The CDC cautions, \"Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\" This article will be updated as new information is obtained.",

        "text":"Abstract Background Human adenoviruses typically cause self-limited respiratory, gastrointestinal, and conjunctival infections in healthy children. In late 2021 and early 2022, several previously healthy children were identified with acute hepatitis and human adenovirus viremia. Methods We used International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes to identify all children (<18 years of age) with hepatitis who were admitted to Children\u2019s of Alabama hospital between October 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022; those with acute hepatitis who also tested positive for human adenovirus by whole-blood quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in our case series. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were obtained from medical records. Residual blood specimens were sent for diagnostic confirmation and human adenovirus typing. Results A total of 15 children were identified with acute hepatitis \u2014 6 (40%) who had hepatitis with an identified cause and 9 (60%) who had hepatitis without a known cause. Eight (89%) of the patients with hepatitis of unknown cause tested positive for human adenovirus. These 8 patients plus 1 additional patient referred to this facility for follow-up were included in this case series (median age, 2 years 11 months; age range, 1 year 1 month to 6 years 5 months). Liver biopsies indicated mild-to-moderate active hepatitis in 6 children, some with and some without cholestasis, but did not show evidence of human adenovirus on immunohistochemical examination or electron microscopy. PCR testing of liver tissue for human adenovirus was positive in 3 children (50%). Sequencing of specimens from 5 children showed three distinct human adenovirus type 41 hexon variants. Two children underwent liver transplantation; all the others recovered with supportive care. Conclusions Human adenovirus viremia was present in the majority of children with acute hepatitis of unknown cause admitted to Children\u2019s of Alabama from October 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, but whether human adenovirus was causative remains unclear. Sequencing results suggest that if human adenovirus was causative, this was not an outbreak driven by a single strain. (Funded in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)",

        "link":"https:\/\/nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMc2207004?query=featured_home",
        "text":"To the Editor: On March 4, 2022, Japanese encephalitis was identified as a \u201ccommunicable disease incident of national significance\u201d in Australia. This notification followed the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in mummified, stillborn, and weak newborn piglets from multiple commercial piggeries across four temperate southern Australian states, with concomitant recognition of human cases of Japanese encephalitis. As of August 1, 2022, a total of 40 cases of infection that had led to 5 deaths had been reported.1 In 1995 and 1998, in the tropical far north of Australia in Queensland, 5 cases of Japanese encephalitis (and 2 deaths) caused by genotype 2 were identified. It was hypothesized that this outbreak resulted from the incursion of cyclonic-wind\u2013transported JEV-infected mosquitoes from Papua New Guinea.2 Since 1998, no further endemic cases of Japanese encephalitis had been detected in Australia until a case in February 2021 that resulted in death. This case appeared to be a sentinel human case of the current outbreak that was identified a year later at a location that was more than 3000 km to the south. Figure 1. Figure 1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Histologic Analysis in the Sentinel Patient. Panel A shows bilateral symmetric thalamic T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusion in a 45-year-old resident of the Tiwi Islands who was treated for progressive neurologic deterioration caused by Japanese encephalitis in February 2021. The patient is now considered to be a sentinel human case of the 2022 outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Australia. Panel B shows the results of postmortem histologic analysis of a midbrain sample from the patient indicating dense lymphocytic perivascular cuffing. In the sentinel case, a 45-year-old resident of the Tiwi Islands (located 80 km north of Darwin on the Northern Territory coast) presented with a 2-day history of acute confusion and fever. The patient was admitted to Royal Darwin Hospital with progressive neurologic deterioration. Despite receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, the patient died 15 days after admission. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 11 million erythrocytes and 88 million lymphocytes per liter, a glucose level of 5.5 mmol per liter, and a protein level of 1.05 g per liter (reference range, 0.15 to 0.45). Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes with T2 hyperintensity in both thalami, in the right cerebellar hemisphere, and in the brain stem (Figure 1A). Results of polymerase-chain-reaction assay for flavivirus RNA were negative on initial analysis of serum and CSF. Serum indirect fluorescent antibody testing was negative on admission but positive on day 13 for JEV IgM and IgG and was equivocal for IgM for the closely related Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus, which is endemic in northern Australia. Postmortem histologic analysis of the brain was consistent with viral panencephalitis (Figure 1B). Most affected were the thalami, brain stem, and upper cervical spinal cord, findings that were consistent with those seen in JEV, MVE, and West Nile virus (WNV) infection.3 A complete JEV genome sequence that was obtained from thalamus tissue (NCBI GenBank accession number, OM867669) indicated that the virus belonged to genotype 4 and was closely related to the 2022 Southeast Australian outbreak strains (>99.7% nucleotide identity) in samples obtained from pigs, humans, and mosquitoes. Genotype 4 JEV has been recognized in Indonesia, including in Bali.4 Possibilities for this introduction into Australia include entry of JEV-infected mosquitoes, either wind-blown or harboring on planes or vessels, or transmission to local mosquitoes from a JEV-infected migratory bird. Subsequent dissemination to southern Australia is likely to have been facilitated by JEV-infected water birds, followed by virus amplification in commercial, domestic, and feral pigs. Ongoing surveillance of commercial piggeries and sampling of mosquitoes and feral pigs will determine the extent to which JEV persists over the current winter and reemerges next summer, with implications for the planning of a possible national rollout of JEV vaccination. The identification of JEV in Australia has many analogies to the introduction and dissemination of WNV in the United States,5 and it is worrisome that JEV may become endemic in Australia.

        "text":"To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences. The panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research. Download the full report Executive Summary As with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists. The physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point. If we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous. The physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.

        "text":"Reflections on Carrie Mae Weems\u2019s RESIST COVID | TAKE 6! I often share a Zimbabwean proverb about lion hunts: \u201cUntil the lion tells its side of the story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.\u201d I felt the spirit of that proverb when I observed Carrie Mae Weems\u2019s RESIST COVID | TAKE 6! public awareness campaign. As an artist, Weems has long used her work to investigate family relationships, cultural identity, sexism, class, political systems, and the consequences of power. Through this collection of posters and billboards, initiated in 2020 and created with Pierre Loving and other artists, Weems is very intentional in the way she elevates stories about the COVID-19 pandemic that reflect the ongoing toll of historical and systemic minoritization, or marginalization of those belonging to minority groups, in the United States and globally. Through images that simultaneously command our attention and cultivate intimacy, Weems clearly aims to demonstrate that there is nothing inherently minor about the lives of those who identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. Unlike anything I have experienced in my lifetime, the pandemic has laid bare the underlying dehumanization of many lives through destructive policies, failed practices, manipulative education, and increasingly corroded quality of life. COVID-19 may have taken a million souls and permanently affected millions more, but it is part of a long history of injustice. In one artwork, Weems\u2019s loud and unapologetic call resonates far beyond the challenges of this pandemic: \u201cTHIS MUST BE CHANGED!!!\u201d And yet, in her installations, Weems reminds viewers that there remain opportunities to reconnect with our truest selves. Weems\u2019s photo of a smiling woman captures resilient optimism, and the overlaid text, \u201cLIFE IS BEAUTIFUL!!\u201d makes the declaration abundantly clear. Many of us have found beauty during the chaos of COVID-19. But like any muscle, this optimism must be constantly exercised to gain and maintain strength. COVID-19 may have taken a million souls and permanently affected millions more, but it is part of a long history of injustice. It is very easy to get swept up in the constant barrage of negativity associated with the pandemic, both organic and manufactured. But, like a mother who comforts a child in pain, Weems lets us know that it will be alright\u2014and we believe it, not just because of the messenger but also because of the message. This is what I love about arts and culture: the immense power that a simple statement can convey, with artists expressing our collective conscience. Weems\u2019s message speaks to the best of humanity during the most challenging of moments, and it reinforces the simple steps\u2014wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and practicing social distancing\u2014that we can all take. It teaches in the best way, both reaffirming and correcting without minimizing either in the process. In another work, she encourages gratitude toward people who have weathered some of the most terrible storms during this experience: the farmers, the postal workers, the teachers, the nannies, and other frontline laborers. It should not be lost on anyone that many of the positions she acknowledges are disproportionately filled by people of color, and that these positions are underappreciated relative to their critical roles in preserving the vitality of this country. The story of how COVID-19 has created distance, literally and figuratively, is a common narrative we all share. I take comfort in Weems\u2019s confidence that \u201cwe\u2019ll hold hands again.\u201d It is another poignant example of what this pandemic has taken away from us\u2014but something we can regain through straightforward public health practices. What greater motivation could there be than to touch and embrace those we love once again? If that opportunity remains, why would we not do everything to seize it? Weems\u2019s message speaks to the best of humanity during the most challenging of moments. Context is key to any effective effort, be it in public health or arts and culture, because it cultivates a deeper level of understanding. Here, Weems\u2019s use of buttons and church fans as conduits for her messages demonstrates the importance of social context, especially for Black people. The unique cultural meanings of the fans and buttons provide a moment for grounding and remembrance of the value of space, connection with faith, and cultivation of perspective. For those involved in health communication, these artifacts demonstrate a truth: if people cannot see themselves in the story, then neither the story nor its message will resonate. Relevance matters. Collectively, we have experienced so much loss in the past two years. The abrupt endings of so many stories make us reflect on our own, and how we want it to be told. What COVID-19 has reinforced for me is that most people want the assurance that they were acknowledged, appreciated, respected, understood, and loved. That\u2019s it.

        "text":"T Lax peer review + social media = misunderstanding science he pandemic has upended many practices, among them peer review of technical medical and scientific articles. Pre-COVID, the preprint sites bioRxiv.org (\u201cbio-archive,\u201d founded in 2013) and medRxiv (\u201cmed-archive,\u201d founded in 2019) were mainly the province of science and medical journalists, and of course researchers. Preprints are technical papers that haven\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed, a process that can take months. Preliminary screens remove outrageous claims and check for plagiarism. Until a few months into the pandemic, the warning on both sites not to report on these papers was hard to navigate to, but seasoned journalists knew to respect the conditions. With general assignment reporters suddenly covering a health care crisis that increasingly required knowledge of virology, immunology, and biotech, medRxiv and bioRxiv became great sources of news. The disclaimer was moved to the opening page: Preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer review. They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. The warning hasn\u2019t helped. Skipping peer review leads to confusion and the spread of misinformation, especially through the echo chamber of social media. \u201cCOVID Vaccine Preprint Study Prompts Twitter Outrage,\u201d for example, details the hoopla over a medRxiv preprint that, according to experts on the statistics used, grossly overestimates the risk of heart inflammation in male teens after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The yelling continues. Follow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP Clinicaltrials.gov as a crystal ball for countering COVID I still hesitate to use preprints as sources for my articles \u2013 this is my 79th on COVID. But I do indulge in looking ahead, by perusing clinicaltrials.gov. Anyone can register a clinical trial at this site \u2013 the intent to run one, as well as detailed protocols as experiments proceed through the 3 phases (safety, safety and efficacy, safety and efficacy on more people). My main interest in ongoing and upcoming COVID clinical trials is to follow the retooling of vaccines to cover new viral variants, for SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate and spread as long as pockets of vaccine hesitancy and refusal persist. The nucleic acid sequences that lie at the core of the vaccines must correspond to the exact ways new variants differ. That\u2019s what a team of 16 experts writing in a Viewpoint in The Lancet concluded, including the two officials who recently resigned from FDA in the wake of the too-soon presidential booster announcement: The effectiveness of boosting against the main variants now circulating and against even newer variants could be greater and longer lived if the booster vaccine antigen is devised to match the main circulating variants. There is an opportunity now to study variant-based boosters before there is widespread need for them. They then compare the situation to the yearly development of new flu vaccines. So I thought I\u2019d peruse the thousand or so entries that pop up at clinical trials.gov searching under \u201cCOVID\u201d and \u201cvaccine.\u201d It\u2019s an eclectic list. 1. The number of studies exploring old vaccines, like the old TB vaccine BCG, has dropped, as things haven\u2019t panned out. 2. Many investigations are evaluating the existing vaccines in various populations, based on geography, age, and combinations of co-morbidities, for example. 3. Several studies \u201cmix and match\u201d vaccine types (Pfizer for one, Moderna for the other, while some pit vaccines against each other, like 40,800 people in Turkey who got either an experimental inactivated vaccine (TURKOVAC) or Sinovac, an approved inactivated vaccine from China. 4. Some new studies look for unusual vaccine side effects, like in the mouth, and vaccine distribution, such as in milk. 5. Lots of texting is going on. Mebo Research\u2019s COVID-19 Back-to-Normal Study is tracking bad reactions to vaccines in 1,000 people for a year, while UCLA researchers are texting 400,000 people, urging them to get vaccinated. Ascension South East Michigan\u2019s \u201cText Message Nudges for COVID-19 Vaccination\u201d are going to 1500 health care employees, and \u201cVaccine Acceptance Intervention for Veterans\u201d is deploying \u201cmotivational interviewing\u201d for 2500 veterans. Efforts at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester and in Ontario help primary care providers fight vaccine hesitancy. 6. Some clinical trials are testing vaccines delivered to different body parts. Immunizing in the nose, throat, and\/or mouth would increase production of IgA antibodies, to complement the IgG antibodies that the approved vaccines elicit, but by themselves aren\u2019t powerful enough. CyanVac\u2019s entrant is a nasal spray that targets the viral spike, but is hooked up to a parainfluenza vaccine \u2013 a dog distemper shot. The vaccine elicits antibodies and killer T cells. I\u2019m most intrigued by a vaccine candidate from ImmunityBio. It\u2019s being tested on people who\u2019ve had their 2 Pfizer or Moderna shots, 20 participants receiving it under the tongue and another 20 under the skin. The third dose targets the spike as well as the nucleocapsid proteins that hug the virus\u2019s genetic material, and also includes an \u201cenhanced T cell stimulation domain\u201d to hike T cell production. The T cell response, only recently demonstrated for the first vaccines, is a much more telling measure of durable protection than antibody ups and downs. Leonard Sender, Chief Operating Officer of ImmunityBio, announced preliminary findings. \u201cOur U.S. data show that just a single prime subcutaneous vaccination with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces a 10-fold increase in T cell response\u2014equivalent to T cell responses from patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The T cell responses are maintained against variants, which is critical to providing protection against this ever-changing virus.\u201d 7. Moderna and Pfizer and others have been tweaking their vaccines to cover additional viral antigens for months, since the variants began sweeping the planet. Moderna\u2019s trial of a vaccine against the B1.351 variant (South Africa) is set to conclude next August, with efforts against delta not far behind. 8. Some vaccine manufacturers are anticipating COVID becoming endemic \u2013 a constant presence everywhere. Novavax, for example, is testing it\u2019s COVID-flu combo in Australia. 9. Magical mystery trials. How about passive immunity from antibodies in horse serum? Or the \u201cuniversal anti-viral vaccine for healthy elderly adults,\u201d aka AlloStim, from Immunovative Therapies. It\u2019s an elixir of donor memory T cells to replace a person\u2019s tired ones, oozing cytokines such as gamma interferon early in viral infection. The cells protect against \u201cany future variants, strains, mutations of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as protection from any future currently unknown newly emergent novel viruses.\u201d Wow. The failure of the entire United States to get behind the vaccine effort is going to keep COVID among us for longer than might have been, a tragic lost opportunity that I just can\u2019t wrap my head around. I think we have another two or three years until SARS-CoV-2 settles down and becomes endemic, a seasonal infection about twice as deadly as influenza. It\u2019s good to know that so many anti-COVID products are in the works. Ricki Lewis has a PhD in genetics and is a science writer and author of several human genetics books.

        "text":"\u201cCould THIS twice-daily probiotic supplement filled with gut friendly bacteria help beat Long Covid?\u201d That\u2019s the headline in the Daily Mail earlier this year, one of dozens in the media across the web promoting the miracle of probiotics. Dozens of other news outlets, from Psychology Today to Medical News Today carried the same unfiltered story. Taking a probiotic supplement, they report, could improve COVID recoveries by promoting the \u201cright mix of gut bacteria\u201d to \u201cboost the body\u2019s immune defenses\u201d. These are not new claims. Since the COVID crisis commenced more than two years, and based on a few sketchy and inconclusive studies, \u2018natural\u2019 websites have been making claims that probiotic supplements could be the magic bullet to halt or even cure COVID. According to NUTRA Ingredients, which peddles supplements \u201ca probiotic formulation could act as a complementary remedy to slow down the progression of COVID-19.\u201d Is it too good to be true? The answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but with nuance. The most recent surge in articles was sparked by a small study out of Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai that suggested \u2018Long Covid\u2019 may be dictated by the microbes in our gut and that probiotics could hold a solution. \u201cThe gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID severity \u2014 possibly via modulating host immune responses,\u201d they claimed. This represents another in a line of studies that seem to support the idea that rebalancing the bacteria in our gut may help fight long-term COVID symptoms. In December, for example, researchers at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust presented data claiming to demonstrate that \u201ctwo capsules a day containing a scientifically chosen blend of natural ingredients could help patients suffering from long COVID\u201d. Oncology consultant Prof Robert Thomas was quoted as saying, \u201cSuch a rapid improvement in the majority who had been experiencing symptoms for over eight months was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.\u201d But most scientists and researchers are more dubious. Certainly, there is no question that our gut bacteria is linked to our health. Whether tinkering with our gut bacteria using supplements can meaningfully help address COVID, or any disease for that matter, is far more problematic. Follow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP Skepticism Since COVID first appeared two years, probiotic devotees have been promoting salves and supplements, claiming that they could boost your immunity and ward off the coronavirus. But the curative claims of probiotics has been met with raised eyebrows from the medical and scientific world. There is widespread evidence that gut bacteria is linked to our health\u2014it\u2019s just that probiotics have not been shown to improve it as an aid to battling COVID. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have responded to the COVID claims with skepticism: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that taking probiotics can prevent or treat COVID-19\u201d. They encourage consumers to \u201cbeware of false claims about COVID-19 cures\u201d. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, was an early voice of caution, challenging probiotics as a COVID-fighting tool. As he told the BBC, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth. In fact, the concept of \u201cboosting\u201d your immune system doesn\u2019t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever. \u201cThe problem is that many of these claims have no grounding in evidence\u201d. This idea was viewed as a case of \u201cpseudoscientists are peddling trendy products such as kombucha and probiotics\u201d. In other words, this idea may be too good to be true for a reason. Such claims during health crises have a long history. During the Spanish flu crisis a century ago, Vick\u2019s VapoRub offered itself as special treatment along with taking laxatives. Crises breed opportunity, and sometimes snake oil salesman. Is that what\u2019s going on here? Dubious claims Certainly, many of the sites promoting probiotics do their best to make it seem their over-the counter and unregulated probiotic products are medical magic. Take one example claiming to present a \u201cNew breakthrough study in overweight adults on a weight loss program\u201d. It is clear to any objective eye that this is an advertisement with the product taking front and center and minimal information about the alleged supporting study: Other ads are a little more subtle. Headlines like \u201cShelf-stable or refrigerated: Which probiotic is better for you?\u201d or \u201c5 surprising signs you probably need a probiotic\u201d are designed to convince the reader into thinking there is scientifically useful information to back up the claims. But that\u2019s not what you find when you \u201cGo to the breakthrough study results\u201d. Instead, you are transported via hyperlinks to supplements and products along with disclaimers stating, \u201cAny products featured in this article are selected by our editors, who don\u2019t play favorites. If you buy something, we may get a cut of the sale.\u201d Many promotional websites contain information that is not only scientifically tenuous, but contrary to the latest data. One common example: articles promoting the use of probiotics to counter gut bacteria loss after a course of antibiotics. This is a popular sales pitch but, unfortunately, data such as this study from the Weismann Institute in Israel suggests this is not such a good idea. Immunologist Dr. Eran Elinav explains: The evidence for taking probiotics after antibiotics is a little murky and contradictory, but the public perception of many people and some doctors is that this is a good idea, even without substantial medical evidence. Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences. We need to be cautious about recommending this until further knowledge emerges. To date, no probiotic has been FDA approved for clinical use, yet supplements flood the market as they remain unregulated in the US and many other countries.. \u201cMarketing of product is often geared directly at consumers without providing direct and consistent proof of effectiveness,\u201d notes the American Gastroenterological Association. So how did this latest probiotic craze gain traction? Let\u2019s review the science. The concept of utilizing probiotics as \u201cCOVID cures\u201d appears to have emerged from multiple studies that suggested the cause may lie within our digestive tract. More specifically, the ~100 trillion bacteria and microorganisms within our gut microbiome. They are a key part of our digestive system. Whenever we eat something, it needs to be broken down so that the nutrients can be absorbed and processed by our body. We cannot do this alone. We require assistance from our gut microbes, particularly in the case of complex carbohydrates and fibers. The bacteria in our gut breakdown and ferment these components and release products that can be utilized by our body. The gut microbiome has been linked to many chronic illnesses in the past but the actual impact it has is often debated and data can be tenuous at best. Now, a new set of claims that \u201ctaking a capsule of probiotics, which are designed to boost the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, may speed up recovery from the coronavirus\u201d are gaining traction. This is further fueled by an initial study from The Chinese University of Hong Kong that reported an increased presence of harmful and pathogenic bacteria in COVID patients with severe\/long-term illness. When paired with the depletion of immune-boosting gut bacteria, the reports suggest that the gut microbial changes could directly relate to an increased risk of developing long-COVID. This has led to some concluding that probiotic supplements could be a way to protect against or treat long term complications of COVID-19 by rebalancing such changes in our gut microbes. Prof Siew NG, head of the study, concluded: The most surprising findings were that different bacteria patterns were associated with different categories of Long Covid symptoms such as respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, hair loss, etc. Such patterns were characterized by a higher level of \u201cunfriendly\u201d microbes and lower levels of \u201cfriendly\u201d microbes. It sounds promising but suggestive news based on incomplete research should always be approached with a considerable caution. First, COVID pathology is complex. It involves a cascade of immune events that can trigger serious consequences in a number of areas of the body. In the words of John Wherry, director of the Penn Medicine Immune Health Institute, \u201cCOVID is deranging the immune system\u201d. Second, and more importantly, we should be wary of studies that play into the billion-dollar probiotic industry narrative that untested products hold the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for complex healthcare issue. According to the Mayo Clinic online, \u201cthere is no clear evidence that probiotics are beneficial,\u201d let alone a potential silver bullet to treat COVID. For the most part, probiotic supplements have no measurable impact on your gut microbiome diversity and may actually cause harm in some instances. Dr Matthew Ciorba, a gastroenterologist at Washington University in St. Louis, echoes this message, saying, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that people with normal gastrointestinal tracts can benefit from taking probiotics.\u201d Many supplement suppliers claim their products \u201coptimize your gut.\u201d That\u2019s mumbo jumbo. The average probiotic supplement contains ~2 billion bacteria. That sounds like a lot but when you consider those 2 billion will only account for 0.002% of the 100 trillion microorganisms in your gut, it\u2019s a bit like dropping a salt particle into a gallon of maple syrup and expecting it to taste salty. The impact will be minimal to non-existent in all but a few specific cases of digestive issues. \u201cEveryone else can save their money, because there\u2019s no evidence that probiotic supplements offer any benefit to already healthy people,\u201d says Prof Jack Gilbert, founder of the American Gut Project. Beyond the hype So why does the hype around a probiotic COVID cure persist? Greed and bad reporting, for the most part. It is often generated by cherry picking of data by websites seeking to promote sales of supplements. Many of the probiotic websites are trying to leverage fear generated by COVID to make a sales pitch for other probiotic supplements. Once you get past the \u2018miracle COVID cure\u2019 headlines, many articles actually report more sober and less encouraging findings. One article claiming probiotics can treat COVID, for example, included a quote from a researcher in the field: \u201cIt is not that the use of one probiotic will reduce all the problems caused by COVID-19\u201d, with the article going on to state that \u201cthe best case for probiotic therapy has been in the treatment of diarrhea\u201d. Hardly the COVID are touted in the headline! The Daily Mail led with the claim that \u201cnow it seems our gut bacteria can also tackle COVID-19\u201d. However, further into the article, the authors of the study are quoted as being much more measured. Professor Andrew Smith (Medical Sciences) offered this measured take on his findings along with a warming about taking probiotics: The study excluded those over 60 and did not account for whether volunteers had been vaccinated or not. So, we don\u2019t know if probiotics provide any benefit to those most at risk of severe Covid. And taking probiotics may be inappropriate for those with a weakened immune system because of the potential increased risk of infection from consuming large quantities of live bacteria. But probiotics are at least harmless, right? If I want to take it as a precaution surely there is no downside to trying it? Unfortunately, that may not be the case. According to research from Eran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science, taking probiotics in certain scenarios can actually cause harm: The probiotics very potently and persistently prevented the original microbiome returning to its original situation. \u2026 This was very surprising and alarming to us. This adverse effect has not been described to date. So there is a risk, however minimal, in taking probiotic supplements in the hope of avoiding complications of COVID-19. When you pair that with the lack of tangible evidence of its benefits, there is not much of a case for probiotics as preventative or acute therapy. It is very difficult to find any reputable medical professional promoting probiotics as COVID treatments. For the most part, the idea is being pushed forward by supplement pushers, diet promoters or people that will sell you a handy and expensive course to help you \u201coptimize your microbiome\u201d. Proceed with caution when articles claim you can cure disease by changing the bacteria in your gut. Especially when they claim you can start healing yourself with a convenient, over the counter probiotic pill\u2014one that your doctor would never prescribe. It\u2019s a snake oil salesman pushing miracle cures. Sam Moxon has a PhD in tissue engineering and is currently a research fellow in the field of regenerative medicine.

The Re of the omicron variant has been estimated to be 2.5 times higher than the delta variant. This increased transmissibility most likely helped omicron out-compete delta to become the dominant variant. The larger question, then, is what is driving the evolution of omicron sublineages? The answer to that is a well-known process called natural selection. Natural selection is an evolutionary process where traits that give a species a reproductive advantage continue to be passed down to the next generation, while traits that don\u2019t are phased out through competition. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, natural selection will favor mutations that give the virus the greatest survival advantage. Follow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP BA.5 will not be the end game. As the virus continues to circulate, this evolutionary trend will likely lead to the emergence of more transmissible variants that are capable of immune escape. While it is difficult to predict what variants will arrive next, we researchers cannot rule out the possibility that some of these variants could lead to increased disease severity and higher hospitalization rates.

        "text":"Experts share tips for improving mental health as we emerge and heal from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become a big part of our daily lives. Between news reports on it, its economic costs, and the regular updates on local cases, it can feel impossible to escape COVID-19\u2019s effects. Feelings of increased anxiety, uneasiness, and fear are far from uncommon \u2014 even when people seem to be thriving at home as they pick up new hobbies or read through their entire home libraries. If you\u2019re still feeling like it\u2019s difficult to move through your day, you\u2019re not alone. How has the pandemic affected our mental health? We\u2019re just starting to truly understand the mental health effects of the past year. \u201cEveryone is experiencing this pandemic and quarantine differently,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Myszak, a child psychologist. \u201cAn apt description I\u2019ve heard is that we are all in the same storm, but we are in different types of boats.\u201d The mental health impact on adults What we do know is that living through a pandemic has removed many foundations we used to rely on, like a stable income, a social support system, and food security. That\u2019s why 2 in 5 U.S. adults reported difficulties with mental health issues and substance use in June 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Nearly 1 in 3 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Mental health professionals have also seen an increase in the number of people seeking professional help and therapy. Even as the pandemic passes its 1-year anniversary, approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults still experience high levels of distress. Many people who were required to report to their workplace in person faced daily stress and fears of contracting the coronavirus in addition to financial insecurity. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 found 34% of adults in the United States were classified as \u201cessential.\u201d Among them: Almost 1 in 3 said they would have to put an unexpected $500 medical bill on a credit card or borrow money. Almost 1 in 5 said they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay it. This type of financial insecurity can add up to an often draining work environment for people who didn\u2019t have the option to work from home. Parents whose kids were (or are) learning remotely \u2014 or were home due to trouble finding day care \u2014 may have also grappled with additional concerns. \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on parents, particularly parents of younger children,\u201d explains Christopher Beevers, professor and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn many cases, the parents have had to take on multiple roles \u2014 caregiver, teacher, parent \u2014 with few opportunities to take a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSimultaneously, many parents are also supposed to be working from home with their own set of deadlines and work responsibilities. This sort of multitasking is highly stressful and puts a huge burden on the family unit,\u201d Beevers says. If you\u2019re still not sure how the pandemic has affected your mental health, you can use this checklist to get some clarity. The mental health impact on children and teens It isn\u2019t just adults who have experienced mental health effects. Children\u2019s mental health may have been affected by disruptions to their schoolwork, learning, and social lives. An estimated 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school closures. This left many feeling isolated and disoriented by the lack of school routine and the difficulties that come with remote learning. \u201cFor many students, online school has been an extreme challenge due to difficulty focusing and staying on task while attending school from home,\u201d explains Kristel Roper, LMFT, LPCC. \u201cStudents with ADHD or other conditions that can make learning difficult have been even more negatively affected by the recent changes.\u201d Because of the school closures, some children with extra developmental needs have been less likely to be noticed and have their needs addressed by their teachers. Myszak explains, \u201cChildren who would be identified in school as needing additional support may not be coming to the attention of the school, so they are not getting the services they need.\u201d There\u2019s also been an increase in reported thoughts of suicide and self-harm among young adults. A recent report from Mental Health America showed an increase in these thoughts, especially among LGBTQIA+ youth. Suicide prevention If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you\u2019re not alone. Help is available right now: You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255. Contact the teen-to-teen peer hotline Teen Line at 800-852-8336 or text TEEN to 839863. Not in the United States? You can find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide. How has the pandemic affected people who already have a mental health condition? If you have an existing mental health condition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some symptoms worse. \u201cIndividuals with anxiety often benefit from increased structure, positive social interactions, and spending time engaging in valued activities,\u201d Roper explains. \u201cAll of these have been made much more difficult by the quarantine.\u201d In addition, physical distancing measures have made it more difficult for some people to find help when dealing with loss or substance use, as many mental health professionals and support groups moved online. According to the CDC, there was an 18.2% increase in overdose-related deaths that accelerated around the time stay-at-home orders were put in place. \u201cSome have referred to the pandemic as an \u2018accelerant\u2019 that has exposed or exacerbated many vulnerabilities in society,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cPeople who have experienced depression in the past or had mild symptoms leading into the pandemic were very likely at high risk for experiencing depression during the pandemic,\u201d he says. Tips to support your mental health through the pandemic Even as we continue to move forward, many people will be reeling and healing from the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While time may be part of the healing equation, there\u2019s a lot you can do now to take care of your mental health. And the rise of online therapy options has made professional mental healthcare more accessible for many people. Here are a few ways to care for your mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Create a daily routine Our daily work commute and office routine were some of the first things to change with the pandemic. If you once had a strict train, mealtime, or day care pickup schedule, staying at home was a real shake-up to your daily routine. That\u2019s why it can help to create a personal daily routine. \u201cI would highly recommend creating your own structure through a routine that you follow each day,\u201d Roper says. For example, it can be helpful to wake up and eat meals at the same time. Focus on reducing stress Making time to take care of yourself can help you better handle the stressors in your life. Like a car trying to run without gas, your capacity to deal with stress may be limited if your physical and mental health are running on empty. \u201cI always recommend starting [with] the basics: eating well and exercising,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cEven just a 15- to 30-minute walk each day can help ease stress and anxiety.\u201d And if you enjoy meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music and sounds, you might schedule time to engage in these activities. Set boundaries between work and home life When you were still working in the office or on location for your job, the act of physically clocking out and heading home was a natural way to transition out of your workday. But when you\u2019re working from home, it can be tough to leave the workday behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to set boundaries between work time and home time. For example, you could \u201ccommute\u201d to another room in your house to work, and leave that room (and work computer) behind when you end your day. If you have a home-based job with nonspecific hours, consider setting a regular work schedule to help prevent tasks from carrying over into your personal time. This can be especially true for parents working at home with their children. \u201cBeing able to turn off the computer, silence the phone, and engage in play and fun activities will speak volumes to children seeking attention,\u201d Myszak says. \u201cShowing children you are willing to spend time with them will be much more effective than anything you would say to them.\u201d Talk with a mental health professional Many resources are available to help you manage mental health challenges during the pandemic. Online therapy is becoming more popular, and it\u2019s proving effective for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you\u2019re interested in finding mental health support online, here are some free online therapy and support services and 10 free mental health apps to get started. Some local and national support groups can also help free of cost. While these alternatives may not be as personalized as one-on-one therapy, it can help to talk with a community of people who\u2019ve had similar experiences. These groups may also help if you\u2019re dealing with loneliness or isolation, because they allow you to interact and talk with people digitally. Mental Health America has also created an extensive list of support groups that can help you find support if you\u2019re dealing with mental health symptoms, domestic violence, or addiction. Be kind to yourself This idea gets repeated so often that it can be hard to remember what it truly means. Practicing kindness toward yourself can mean treating yourself like you\u2019d treat a loved one when you\u2019re feeling not so great. \u201cWe can be our own worst critics,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cA little self-compassion can go a long way towards feeling better. We are all doing the best that we can under incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d The COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s role in mental health Many people are feeling relief after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For them, it has helped lower anxiety about contracting the virus, being hospitalized, or dying as a result of the disease. Still, many people have been skeptical of the vaccine\u2019s accelerated rollout and possible side effects. This remains a real concern among some people in the United States. \u201cFor those who are wary of the vaccine, I always recommend doing your research,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is ask your own trusted healthcare team. They\u2019ll be able to share their professional opinions with your specific needs in mind.\u201d You can also talk with friends and family about their experiences during the pandemic and with the vaccine. Since so much of the pandemic was marked by distancing our relationships, there\u2019s great potential for healing as we start to slowly and safely reunite. \u201cFor many, the vaccine rollout has brought with it a collective sigh of relief,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cIt has also likely been highly emotional for many as we begin to see our loved ones, friends, neighbors, and communities get the vaccine and feel, for the first time in a while, that feeling of hope.\u201d",

        "text":"Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling. If this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time? Research on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt. These findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis? To find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all. People who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted. These findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Although we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood. Making your social media a more positive place Our research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content. But we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does. So what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable? We found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee\/Shutterstock One option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020. But how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible? Given that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive. Be mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think. Importantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health. As the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.

        "text":"Despite claims of anti-vaccine activists no different than groups that used to claim vaccines cause autism, COVID-19 vaccines do not impact fecundability\u2014the probability of conception per menstrual cycle\u2014in female or male partners who received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The prospective study instead indicates that COVID-19 infection among males may temporarily reduce fertility\u2014 an outcome that could be avoidable through vaccination. Lead author Dr. Amelia Wesselink, epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, and colleagues analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fecundability, among female and male participants in the BUSPH-based Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing NIH-funded study that enrolls women trying to conceive, and follows them from preconception through six months after delivery. Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021. The researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility. While COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction. \u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d The new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination.",

        "text":"Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom. But how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them. People are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates. Throughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication. Co-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video. The researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation. Similarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task. Three areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University Results of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition. There were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them. To simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior. \"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\" There was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face. Comparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions. \"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\"",

        "text":"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19. The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax. The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia. This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19? What\u2019s in the mix? Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself. All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question. We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response. The Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus. By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response. However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on. So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated. The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system. The spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided Rethinking an influenza vaccine The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu. The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus). In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine. An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age. This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial. Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza. These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza. So the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2? The Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock The Australian clinical trial The new phase I\/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response. Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms. The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M. All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot. This design enables researchers to ask four important questions: can the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough? While it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals. And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19. We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants. The Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.

        "title":"How To Spot Coronavirus Fake News",
        "link":"https:\/\/scienceblogs.com\/sb-admin\/2020\/03\/20\/how-spot-coronavirus-fake-news-151444",
        "text":"The proliferation of fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic has been labelled a dangerous \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division. Confusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy. If the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way. Similarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories. What to look out for Source. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly. Logo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website. Bad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions. Pretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this. Over-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works. Use fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media. Who to trust The best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles. Even government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields. A time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young\/EPA Charlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19. The effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19. Unfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable. We can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.

        "text":"Health officials in the UK have just made the country the first to approve a new bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that targets both the omicron variant and original virus. The Biden administration is currently working on its own booster campaign for next month and the Food and Dug Administration (FDA) has received assurances from both Modern, Pfizer, and BioNTech that doses of the re-tooled vaccine will be available by September. Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Moderna developed the booster, which was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) after it was found to meet regulator\u2019s standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness. As of late July, Moderna said that it has secured 66 million doses of a vaccine that targets both the 2020 strain of the virus and the new sub-variants. \u201cThe first generation of COVID-19 vaccines being used in the UK continue to provide important protection against the disease and save lives. What this bivalent vaccine gives us is a sharpened tool in our armory to help protect us against this disease as the virus continues to evolve,\u201d said June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, in a press release. \u201cWe have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved COVID-19 vaccines and this will include the vaccine approved today.\u201d [Related: Moderna is testing an Omicron-specific COVID vaccine. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s faring.] Half of each dose targets the original virus with the other half targeting the highly contagious omicron variant. According to the MHRA, the new formula was effective against omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5 in clinical trials. BA.4 and BA.5 are currently the dominant strains of the virus and a study published in the June 2022 issue of Cell shows that the two have a strong ability to escape the antibodies built from previous vaccination. While worldwide case numbers are not as high as winter 2021-2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been reporting huge numbers of fresh cases throughout the summer, due in large part to these highly contagious sub-variants and waning immunity from vaccination or previous infection. The new bivalent vaccines could help stem a possible fall and winter surge that could potentially lead to 100 million infections. According to data complied by The Washington Post, about 330 million Americans have been fully vaccinated and the infection rate stands at around 266 new infections per 100,000 people over the past week. In Britain, close to three quarters of the population have been fully vaccinated.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/environment\/heatwave-europe-air-conditioning-limits\/",
        "text":"Europe is facing another heat wave after July\u2019s record-breaking bout of heat that caused deadly wildfires in the UK, France, and Spain. Seville, Spain, became the first city in the world to name a heat wave, calling the particularly brutal temperature spike \u201cZoe,\u201d not unlike hurricanes or tropical storms, last month to underscore the threat it posed. But that\u2019s not the only thing that has changed because of the massive heat waves ripping through the region. As of August 2nd, the Spanish government requires businesses to keep their thermostats at 27 degrees Celsius in the summer season (around 80 degrees Fahrenheit) or above to conserve energy (certain businesses, like bars and restaurants, can keep thermostats at around 25 degrees Celsius). Greece implemented a similar strategy for public buildings earlier in the summer. Energy prices have been high in recent months due to the war in Ukraine, and these heat waves are creating more demand for energy as people run air conditioners to try to stay cool. Without climate change, these heat waves would be more or less impossible at this scale. Using more energy to keep indoor temperatures comfortable unfortunately contributes to climate change when energy is generated by burning fossil fuels. In Europe, about 70 percent of its power is generated by burning fossil fuels. \u201cIf you increase your energy usage and your grid is still reliant, even partially, on fossil fuels, then that\u2019s going to increase your total emissions,\u201d says Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, \u201cThat\u2019s going to make climate change worse. It\u2019s a little bit of a feedback loop.\u201d That being said, Dessler feels air conditioning is a human right, which is a growing view. AC will only become more necessary as the climate warms. Ideally, countries will move off fossil fuels as quickly as possible, so higher energy demands don\u2019t worsen climate change. Then, people can keep their homes and businesses at a comfortable temperature. [Related: How to protect your children during heat waves.] \u201cAC is something we need. There are a lot of places in the US. and around the world where if you didn\u2019t have air conditioning there would be ghost towns,\u201d Dessler says. He says large parts of Texas, where he lives, need air conditioning to remain habitable. Places like Spain limiting how low a business can set its thermostat or states like Texas asking people to reduce energy use during a heat wave to protect the grid can cause real problems for residents. \u201cPeople lived in Texas before air conditioning, but you just lived differently,\u201d Dessler says. \u201cThey built their houses to be well-ventilated. There were designs for breezes to run through the house.\u201d In parts of the world where extreme heat is commonplace, homes are often designed to be well-ventilated and promote airflow to keep things cool. In the Middle East, a courtyard might funnel in a breeze and provide shade. Water fixtures and plants might provide cooling effects. Suppose we redesigned our homes and buildings to allow for better airflow, painted buildings lighter colors to reflect sunlight, and strategically placed windows and columns of air. In that case, homes could require less air conditioning to stay cool during extreme heat. \u201cNobody designs their house like that today because everyone in Texas has a house that\u2019s closed, sealed and air conditioned,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn the long run, you can design a city to do better in hot temperatures.\u201d Though these heat waves have been breaking records, Dessler says that doesn\u2019t necessarily come as a surprise. As far as we know, climate change isn\u2019t moving faster than climate scientists have predicted in their climate models. \u201cThe global average temperature is warming exactly as predicted. Predicting heat waves, which are local events on a very short timescale, is much harder to do,\u201d Dessler says. \u201cYou obviously can do it with a model, and in general, the magnitude of these heat waves is not too far off from what the models predict.\u201d The world is going to need more and more air conditioning, and Dessler says that solar and wind are easier and more affordable to install than they\u2019ve ever been before. Hence, countries need to build up renewable energy and get off fossil fuels so that increased energy demands don\u2019t worsen climate change. If you\u2019re worried about how your energy use contributes to climate change, you might want to get your community to start a microgrid or even consider installing a heat pump in your home. But in the meantime, shut down unnecessary appliances, strategically place fans, block sunlight, and manage your home\u2019s humidity to help keep things cool without blasting the AC.",

        "title":"As COVID vaccines reach kids worldwide, a gap in Africa leaves everyone exposed",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/health\/covid-vaccines-kids-africa\/",
        "text":"Just one year after the coronavirus pandemic began, vaccine researchers finished the first formulas that could protect people against SARS-CoV-2. Since then, more than 12 billion doses of various COVID vaccines have been administered around the world, largely in adults from 18 to 65 years old. Now, the global COVID vaccination rollout is shifting as several countries turn their attention to immunizing children. In October 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer and Moderna shots for Americans between the ages of 5 and 1; it then green-lit vaccines for kids younger than 5 after considering new clinical trial results this June. About 862,000 individuals in that last category got at least one dose of a COVID vaccine this summer. Other governments, including the UK, Canada, France, and Germany, have opened up COVID vaccinations to children in the past year. India, for instance, moved Bharat Biotech\u2019s homegrown Covaxin vaccine forward for restricted emergency use in children aged 6 to 12 years this April. [Related: Just had COVID? Here\u2019s when you should get a booster.] Even though studies suggest that risk of death or severe disease from COVID is low among young people, inoculating them against SARS-CoV-2 could significantly reduce the spread of the virus and any new variants. And while children\u2019s COVID vaccination rates are rising globally, health experts say there should be more campaigns targeting Africa, where the world\u2019s youngest population lives. The mean age across the continent is 19.7 years; more than 540 million of the children are younger than 14. So far, 23 out of 54 African nations have vaccinated some youth against SARS-CoV-2. Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, has only authorized the shots for children who are 16 and 17 years old, specifically for educational and international travel purposes. \u201cThat allowance is very small, so essentially, it\u2019s still 18 and above,\u201d Nadia Sam-Agudu, a pediatrician who works in Nigeria, says. Meanwhile, South Africa, which has a population of more than 60 million people, was among the first to begin vaccinating kids between ages 12 to 17 years last October. Smaller governments like Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Rwanda, and Togo have found traction as well\u2014in all, nearly 18 million young people have been immunized on the continent, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa reports. Sam-Agudu, who is part of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, emphasizes that it\u2019s crucial to vaccinate children in Africa before they\u2019re seriously ill and need medical attention. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a good COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the light that it\u2019s a pandemic and newly emerging pathogen. We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s coming down the line\u2014we\u2019ve seen enough of what it can do,\u201d she adds. In a study published this January in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, scientists from the African Forum for Research and Education in Health COVID-19 Research Collaboration on Children and Adolescents found that hospitalized youth across the continent are at higher risk of death and severe disease from the virus than those in high-income countries. The authors identified the lack of access to intensive care units, testing, and treatments as a major reason. COVID vaccines could make a difference. Sam-Agudu says African countries that have not immunized children yet should consider \u201cscaling and approving\u201d the shots. \u201cThis is the time that we need to mobilize and make sure that children, including pregnant women, are vaccinated. We should not be complacent,\u201d she notes. [Related: It\u2019s harder for kids with food allergies to catch COVID] Although nations like the US have donated vaccines to Africa through the COVAX initiative, if the formulas are not widely approved for children on the local level, they will not reach the scale of the continent\u2019s population. When developing COVID vaccination programs for adolescents, WHO recommends each country consider the benefits in their specific epidemiological and social context. But disease researchers and COVID policy advisers say this puts the responsibility on African governments to conduct their own resource-intensive research to guide decision-making. Phionah Atuhebwe, the vaccines introduction medical officer at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, backs the individual approach. \u201cAlthough severe COVID-19 is rare in children, it does occasionally occur. In some cases, vaccinating them is particularly important,\u201d she says. She notes that the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization states that kids older than 12 who are at higher risk for severe COVID should be offered an mRNA vaccine, along with other priority groups. While scientists and public health experts look for better ways to protect people against COVID in the long term, their plans and protocols will need to focus on boosting immunity in all ages, in as many parts of the world as possible. It\u2019s the only way to beat a global disease.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/health\/new-york-city-west-nile-virus\/",
        "text":"Health officials in New York City reported two human cases of the West Nile virus (WNV), amid a banner summer for infected mosquitoes\u2014and COVID-19 and monkeypox and polio\u2014in the city. According to a statement from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, one case was found in Brooklyn and one in Queens. The department also said that a record number of WNV-infected of mosquitoes have been detected in the city. A total of 1,068 mosquito pools have tested positive across the five city boroughs, compared to 779 positive pools last year. \u201cWe are in the height of West Nile virus season, but there are things you can do to decrease your risk of being bitten,\u201d said Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, via press release. Vasan explained that steps like using an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and long pants during dusk and dawn can help prevent contracting the virus. \u201cIn addition, you can stop mosquitoes from laying eggs in the water by emptying outdoor containers that hold water,\u201d Dr. Vasan added. The virus is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. WNV season typically runs from July through October when mosquitoes are most prevalent. There is currently no vaccine for the virus, so these preventative measures are the best way to avoid infection. Symptoms of WNV include fatigue, fever, headache, body aches, and rash, but according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 80% of people do not experience any symptoms. The majority of people infected with WNV fully recover, but some can continue to have problems after infection. There is a risk that some people, especially those 60 years and older or the immunocompromised, can develop a serious or potentially fatal illness of the brain and spinal cord. Anyone experiencing WNV symptoms is urged to contact their health care provider to seek treatment. A total of 54 human cases of the virus disease have been reported to the CDC as of August 9th. In 2021, a total of 2,695 human cases were reported to the federal agency. Viruses like WNV are likely to increase as the planet warms. According to a study published on August 8th in the journal Nature Climate Change, the effects of climate change will potentially aggravate over half of presently-known human pathogenic diseases. The authors write that, \u201cwarming and precipitation changes, for instance, were associated with range expansion of vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, birds, and several mammals implicated in outbreaks by viruses, bacteria, animals, and protozoans, including dengue, chikungunya, plague, Lyme disease, West Nile virus, Zika, trypanosomiasis, echinococcosis, and malaria to name a few.\u201d",

        "text":"This article about the settlement of a lawsuit and COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law. Professor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy. Headlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context. Three points need to be made: First, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption. Second, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing. Third, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground. Photo by cottonbro on Pexels.com Background on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit Apparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option. Out of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned. Fourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context. Legal context The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before. But for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains: Generally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation. However, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show. In short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions. In addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule. And again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere. This looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds. Not only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions. This is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis. As a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement. Photo by Leon Seibert on Unsplash The Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement The settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts. Financial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https:\/\/www.beckershospitalreview.com\/legal-regulatory-issues\/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid). In addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit. Work-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague. Why did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear. The complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming: Initially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff. This would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said. If the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity. What does this settlement mean? Anti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either. Legally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies. In fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption. A claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d This is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant. The problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them. If the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern. ________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

If the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity. What does this settlement mean? Anti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either. Legally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies. In fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption. A claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d This is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant. The problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them. If the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern. ________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.skepticalraptor.com\/skepticalraptorblog.php\/settlement-of-lawsuit-about-covid-vaccine-religious-exemptions\/",
        "text":"This article about the settlement of a lawsuit and COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law. Professor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy. Headlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context. Three points need to be made: First, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption. Second, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing. Third, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground. Photo by cottonbro on Pexels.com Background on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit Apparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option. Out of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned. Fourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context. Legal context The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before. But for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains: Generally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation. However, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show. In short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions. In addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule. And again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere. This looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds. Not only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions. This is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis. As a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement. Photo by Leon Seibert on Unsplash The Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement The settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts. Financial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https:\/\/www.beckershospitalreview.com\/legal-regulatory-issues\/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid). In addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit. Work-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague. Why did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear. The complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming: Initially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff. This would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said. If the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity. What does this settlement mean? Anti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either. Legally, this is not news.

Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bio.org\/blogs\/despite-covid-19-pandemic-bioscience-economy-remains-resilient",
        "text":"Throughout 2021, there was a great deal of advances in the biotechnology sector in the United States \u2013 thanks, in part, to state-led and regional economic development initiatives which have created jobs, advanced educational opportunities, and championed innovation. According to the recently published report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and the Council of State Bioscience Associations (CSBA), \u201cDriving the Bioscience Economy Forward During the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d, state and regional initiatives ensured that the United States continues to be competitive in the global marketplace as a leader in the bioscience industry. The purpose of the report is \u201cto help our partners out there \u2026 understand how we are a part of the larger ecosystem in a growing number of states,\u201d said Pete Pellerito, Senior Policy Adviser for Federal\/State Economic Development & Technology Transfer Lead at BIO. \u201cThis report really reinforces the depth and the diversity of our geographic footprint in the country.\u201d \u201cWe can build all the new buildings we want, we can bring all the new equipment we want, have all the intellectual property in place, but if we don\u2019t have the people to drive it \u2026 [all] forward, any state, any region, is going to be at a disadvantage,\u201d Pellerito continued. Ultimately, the U.S. bioscience industry employs 1.87 million people across more than 101,000 U.S. businesses. Here are just a few examples of how states are driving the bioscience economy. Biomanufacturing Biomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that leverages biological systems for the production of commercially vital biomolecules and biomaterials for medicines, food, and beverage processing as well as industrial use. State-level measures noted in the report to advance biomanufacturing include Ohio\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, which is a competitive grant program to encourage new advanced manufacturing project and service activity. In North Carolina, the state\u2019s Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) provides hands-on education and training both in biomanufacturing methods as well as bioprocessing concepts. This training and education is in full compliance with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), a set of regulations published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, North Carolina provides both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) state matching grants as well as a manufacturing sales tax exemption on equipment. Meanwhile, Connecticut has a Manufacturing Innovation Fund that offers worker training and apprenticeship programs, loans, grants, and vouchers. In addition, the state is aiming to support the creation of at least 15,000 new jobs over the next five years in advanced manufacturing, data science, and insurance technology. The importance of public-private partnership Public-private partnerships will continue to be key to the development of the bioscience industry in the United States. In Massachusetts, Harvard and MIT came together in 2021 to start building a 40,000 square foot facility to create partnerships between the biopharmaceutical sector, academia, and medical leaders to advance the development of new treatment technologies for patients. The state government of Massachusetts is involved in this effort through the Massachusetts Life Science Center. Over in Tennessee, the state has directed $2.5 million of the state\u2019s budget during the 2021-2022 fiscal year towards the development of public-private partnerships to develop animal health drug products by working with universities, which have strong veterinary medicine and agricultural programs that study animal dermatological conditions and cancers. What\u2019s next for the bioscience industry? As the 2022 elections are approaching, Pellerito stated \u201cI have never felt that support for our industry has been partisan. I think it\u2019s very bipartisan.\u201d No matter what the political winds have in store later this year, the biotech sector will continue to play an integral role in job creation and innovation across different states and regions, he said. When asked regarding what efforts are being made to advance opportunities for members of historically underrepresented communities across different states and regions, Pellerito pointed to BIO\u2019s BIOEquality Agenda, stating that increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the bioscience industry is of the utmost importance both to BIO members as well as to various academic partners. As the report makes clear, despite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bioscience industry is in a strong position for continued growth. Ultimately, the success of the industry is dependent upon maintaining and expanding existing partnerships, all while creating new ones to further advance the opportunities that it provides in the communities it collaborates with and serves.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bio.org\/blogs\/biotech-changed-covid-did-covid-change-biotech",
        "text":"COVID changed our world forever\u2014no one will forget the profound effect this modern pandemic has had on our everyday lives. Thankfully, we finally see the end of the pandemic, thanks in large part to the biotechnology industry. Without its immediate and tireless work to figure out what COVID-19 was, to develop therapeutics to treat it, and to finally find a way to protect against it with several vaccines, we might still be in dire straits today. Biotech definitively changed COVID, but did the virus change our industry? Today, we speak with experts about the lasting effect the pandemic has had on biotech and what changes we expect to see permanently. The transmission and spread of COVID highlighted how intricately everything on the planet is connected\u2014the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d \u201cThe real basics behind the One Health concept is that the health of people, the health of animals, and the health of our environment are inextricably linked. So, changes in one affect the others,\u201d explains Dr. William Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy at the Echo Health Alliance. \u201cOne Health brings that together \u2013 rather than saying that human health and animal health, environmental health are separate and can be addressed separately, they can\u2019t be addressed separately because they interact so much.\u201d With that idea of connection and oneness comes a natural need for collaboration, which we saw first-hand in the fight against COVID-19. Cartier Esham, BIO\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, says \u201ccompanies jumped in because they wanted to help solve the global crisis\u2026It was their challenge to meet; and they did so.\u201d And we are thankful they did. It was truly an all-hands-on deck approach. Companies in the space pivoted from research projects to help. Aaron Sato, Chief Scientific Officer of Twist Bioscience, said that the company was able to provide scientific researchers at other biotech companies with synthetic versions of the virus to study which minimized their exposure risk. Helping other companies was not a fiscal decision, but a moral one. Because of this collaboration for the public good, public opinion of the biotech industry has drastically improved. Ron Foshay of Service Research Insights says \u201cthe extraordinary effort made to develop safe and effective vaccines, one survey reported, shows that positive ratings of pharmaceutical companies went from 32% in early 2020 to 62% in early 2021. That\u2019s a really big jump.\u201d Collaboration and improved public opinion weren\u2019t the only good outcomes to come from battling COVID-19. Karesh highlights another \u2013 greater public understanding of the industry and clinical testing as a whole. And Esham hopes that the COVID-era change in clinical testing practices of bringing trials to patients will have a profound and beneficial impact on clinical trials of the future. Biotechnology has always been home to rapidly changing science, but COVID-19 fundamentally reshaped tenets of the industry in a way that will likely benefit more people.

        "text":"It\u2019s been two years since COVID-19 was officially named a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it seems we are finally on the edge of moving from a pandemic to an endemic. But what does this mean\u2014and what lessons can we take with us as we think about COVID-19 staying with us, or perhaps the next pandemic that may come sooner than we\u2019d like? \u201cYear 2 showed us that there's some durability to these vaccines,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, BIO\u2019s Vice President of Infectious Diseases & Emerging Science. \u201cYear 2 showed us that we can vaccinate at younger ages, and we found that heterologous boosting could actually lead to very interesting duration protection, which is a powerful thing scientifically.\u201d \u201cAnother thing we learned in Year 2 was the power of activating messengers to talk to their specific community about vaccination is incredibly important and that that is what we need to be doing across all kinds of health care,\u201d continued Arthur. \u201cThe lack of understanding also opened the window for those who are anti-vaccine to actually take advantage of those misgivings. And people spread misinformation in communities that they weren't even a part of.\u201d It\u2019s the biggest vaccination campaign in American history\u2014but not everyone\u2019s on board.

Listen: https:\/\/t.co\/ckDrxBcU7R pic.twitter.com\/OGqsUDZ7UQ \u2014 I Am Biotech (@IAmBiotech) April 20, 2021 \u201cWhat does the end of the pandemic look like?\u201d asked Arthur. \u201cFor me, it's the stabilization of the incidence of disease and prevalence of the strains. That change is coming [\u2026] If you can literally, generally manage the number of people who are ill and hospitalized with existing medicine and have relatively controlled, or no, breakthroughs amongst people who are vaccinated, then we are kind of where the flu is.\u201d But it is important to plan for the next pandemic now. \u201cEverybody wants to get on with the rest of their lives, and this is fine for the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the legislators and the administration needs to actually take the moment to step back and look at this and ask, what are the systems and safeguards I need to keep?\u201d Why IP protection is critical to pandemic preparedness The proposed waiver of IP for COVID vaccine technology could counteract future pandemic preparedness. While some have argued a waiver of the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would facilitate COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution, the exact opposite is true, experts told us. We\u2019ll say it again: Waiving IP rights would compromise global vaccination efforts. \u201cThey argue that eliminating IP protections would allow any willing company to produce lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, making them cheaper and more widely accessible in low-income nations,\u201d BIO\u2019s Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath responded succinctly. \u201cIf true, that would be a compelling argument. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d The problem with access is not so cut and dry, BIO\u2019s Senior Manager of International Affairs, Hillary Stiss, explains: \u201cIt is not an issue of IP that is preventing people from getting vaccines particularly in Africa. Really it is issues around African healthcare systems not being able to absorb vaccines and deliver it into arms.\u201d As Hans Sauer, BIO\u2019s Deputy General Counsel and Vice President for Intellectual Property, further explained, there have been over 30 COVID vaccines developed\u2014not just the Pfizer, Modern, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines\u2014apparently without interference by anyone's patent rights. So, the idea that patents are getting in the way is incorrect. Yet the very arguments used by governments to waive COVID IP rights seem to be a red herring to deflect from problematic global north government policy, while simultaneously disrespecting the work done by the private sector to step up and address this pandemic in record time \u2013 all with the added risk of disrupting investment, as well as R&D within biotech companies that would do absolutely nothing to help safeguard against the next big pandemic. \u201cThere are certain folks who are willing to trade the next decades\u2019 innovation for access today as opposed to thinking of ways to manage access in a way that doesn't trade future innovation,\u201d noted Arthur. \u201cYou don't sell the rug out from under companies in order to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cCompanies' memories are actually quite long and if we have another pandemic and ask companies to help after forcing them to share their trade secrets they are going to resist.

Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias\/Fact Check. Herd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: \u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d The headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.] Marm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated. Kilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population. \u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d The article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population. \u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d In short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded. Apart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity. Tara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2]. Virologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread: No, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https:\/\/t.co\/xkAQKU1hg6 \u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity \u20142\/3 of the US population has not had covid \u2014Wrong on T-cell protection \u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective \u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com\/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021 William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading. \u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said. As reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d Curiously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection. One reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor. \u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said. Cases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed. In summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave. While the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants. Masks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7\/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021 Former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d You can read the original Wall Street Journal article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK A. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz: The article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent). 1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence. 2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. Using the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%\/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims. Thus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data. Tara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University: There are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2]. William Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health: This is not an exhaustive list. The estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500\/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000\/million in Virginia, and about 300\/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing. There are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection. The article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7]. Finally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination. REFERENCES",

        "text":"CLAIM \u201cNew paper suggests Covid mRNA vaccination rates are linked to increases in overall deaths\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Alex Berenson, Substack, 28 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Misrepresents source: The preprint used to support the claim investigated the correlation between the distribution of mortality across Dutch cities and COVID-19 vaccination coverage. However, Berenson presented some numerical results as if it were an increase in overall mortality. Furthermore, this numerical result wasn\u2019t adjusted for possible bias. Inadequate support: The preprint used to support the claim used city-level data and not individual-level data which precludes drawing conclusions on the impact of vaccination on the risk of dying. Furthermore, all possible confounding factors aren\u2019t accounted for, which may bias the final results. KEY TAKE AWAY COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in several large clinical trials. Their effectiveness largely outweigh the risk of rare side effects. A study comparing vaccination coverage and all-cause mortality in Dutch cities doesn\u2019t show that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of dying. The study\u2019s design is not appropriate to draw such a conclusion. FULL CLAIM: \u201cNew paper suggests Covid mRNA vaccination rates are linked to increases in overall deaths\u201d; the paper suggests a 5% increase in mortality due to vaccination. REVIEW More than 80% of the Dutch population over 12 has been vaccinated against COVID-19, as of August 2022. Large clinical trials and ongoing monitoring of the millions vaccinated worldwide show that COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness largely outweigh the risks of rare side effects and effectively protect against severe forms of the disease. However, inaccurate claims that these vaccines are dangerous, increase the risk of death, or weaken the immune system frequently circulated on social media, and Health Feedback already debunked several of them. Journalist Alex Berenson made such a claim in July 2022 when he stated on Substack that new results \u201csuggested Covid mRNA vaccination rates are linked to increases in overall deaths\u201d. Berenson had made multiple inaccurate and misleading claims about COVID-19 and vaccines that Health Feedback previously debunked. In his article from 28 July 2022, Berenson reported on a preprint (a study not yet peer-reviewed or accepted by a journal) published by Andr\u00e9 Redert, who previously worked as a researcher in computing sciences but is not trained in virology, immunology, or epidemiology. In that preprint, Redert compared the all-cause mortality and vaccination coverage in Dutch cities. Although Berenson acknowledged that the preprint doesn\u2019t demonstrate that vaccination caused an increase in all-cause mortality, this is implied by the Substack article\u2019s headline. Berenson also combined his take on Redert\u2019s preprint with observations of increased all-cause mortality in \u201chighly vaccinated countries\u201d. Regardless of whether this last statement is accurate, it is clear that Berenson\u2019s subtext is that mRNA vaccination causes an increase in mortality. The readers\u2019 comments section at the bottom of the article clearly shows that this is how his article is interpreted. As we explain below, however, Berenson\u2019s interpretation is incorrect and based on a flawed interpretation of the preprint\u2019s results. Redert\u2019s preprint itself suffers from limitations that weaken the conclusions that can be made about vaccine safety. There is no established causal relationship between all-cause mortality and vaccination coverage In his paper, Redert looked at the distribution of mortality and vaccination coverage between Dutch cities. Some cities presented an all-cause mortality above average, and others, below. Similarly, some cities had vaccination coverage above the national average and other cities below. Redert then tried to determine if there was a correlation between the two and, if so, what proportion of the mortality was distributed across cities in the same way as vaccination coverage. In other words, Redert asked to what extent a city with an above average vaccination coverage would see its all-cause mortality also rise above average or, conversely, drop below average. Redert observed that the weekly mortality partially correlated with vaccine coverage. In other words, cities with an all-cause mortality above average tended to also exhibit vaccination coverage above average. However, it is important to stress that Redert\u2019s preprint only established correlations between vaccination coverage and mortality, and didn\u2019t demonstrate any causal association. Correlation by itself doesn\u2019t prove that one event is the cause of another. Redert\u2019s preprint also doesn\u2019t provide any biological explanation or medical evidence showing that vaccination increases the likelihood of dying. Furthermore, Redert used city-level data: all-cause mortality and vaccination coverage in that same city. Drawing conclusions on the risk of individuals dying from average data obtained at the city level is known as an ecological fallacy. In our case, city-level data tell us nothing as to whether vaccinated people were overrepresented among those who died, for instance. Therefore, data from Redert\u2019s preprint aren\u2019t suitable to support Berenson\u2019s suggestion that vaccination is linked to an increase in all-cause mortality. Berenson\u2019s interpretation of data is flawed In his account of Redert\u2019s preprint, Berenson misinterpreted some of the results and used them to draw ill-founded conclusions. Redert provided the example of a given week where 5% of the total 4,000 deaths from all causes of that week\u2014that is, 200 deaths\u2014were distributed between cities in the same way the vaccination coverage was. The remaining 3,800 deaths were distributed across cities in a manner uncorrelated with vaccination coverage. Berenson apparently interpreted this 5% of \u201cvaccination-correlated mortality\u201d as an increase in the total number of deaths, because he also claimed that his 5% figure was consistent with other data reporting a 5% excess mortality in several countries. He then went on to comment that a 5% increase would actually represent many more dead people in the long run. However, Berenson\u2019s interpretation of this piece of data is erroneous. This 5% figure from Redert\u2019s preprint is not related to the number of all-cause deaths that Berenson cited. Redert\u2019s analysis focused on the distribution of deaths across all cities, not on the total number of deaths. In fact, Redert warned: \u201cThese [5% deaths] are not 200 additional deaths related to vaccination, it means that 200 out of 4k deaths were distributed over municipalities in the same pattern as vaccination coverage\u201d. Also, this 5% figure is the result of Redert\u2019s analysis for one week\u2014week 50 of 2021\u2014used as an example and isn\u2019t necessarily representative of the entire pandemic, contrary to what Berenson suggested. Third, many confounding factors bias the direct comparison of all-cause mortality and vaccination coverage. Confounding factors are variables that affect the outcome of an experiment, but aren\u2019t the variables being studied. If scientists don\u2019t factor in the influence of confounding factors in their study, they may draw erroneous conclusions about causality. For example, older people are more likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to die from any cause. Therefore, one would expect that cities with an older population will exhibit a higher than average vaccination coverage and a higher all-cause mortality without any causal association between the two. Redert was well aware of these confounding factors and proposed a way to take them into account by normalizing his results to pre-pandemic mortality data. However, this 5% figure Berenson extracted from the preprint comes from the raw data and not from the normalized data adjusted for confounding factors. Considering all the above, it is clear that Berenson\u2019s take on Redert\u2019s paper is thus flawed and his conclusions are inaccurate. Additional limitations of the Dutch cities study preclude drawing conclusions Even when considering the adjustments for confounding factors proposed by Redert, the study\u2019s design limits what can be concluded from it. First, Redert used weekly mortality data, but these data were compared with the final vaccination coverage of November 2021. In order to really compare if the mortality correlated with the vaccination coverage, at least partially, it would be better to use mortality and vaccination coverage data from the same week. Given that the study aimed to investigate whether vaccination impacted all-cause mortality, one could even imagine comparing the mortality of a given week with the vaccination coverage of an earlier time period, but not with the final vaccine coverage. Second, Redert took into account some important confounding factors by normalizing his results by the mortality in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. While this can correct confounding factors due to demographic, such as age or wealth, it would not correct for any other possible confounding factors that would affect both all-cause mortality and vaccine coverage during the pandemic. For instance, we can hypothesize that cities heavily impacted by COVID-19 will tend to vaccinate more, resulting in higher vaccination coverage, but at the same time would suffer from greater disruption to vital elements such as transport and healthcare that could worsen all-cause mortality. Conclusion Berenson incorrectly suggests that COVID-19 vaccination can increase all-cause mortality based on the results from a non-peer-reviewed publication. However, Berenson\u2019s interpretation of the publication is flawed. Furthermore, several limitations in the design of the study itself make it impossible to draw conclusions from the results. By contrast, large clinical trials, as well as the millions vaccinated against COVID-19 in real-world conditions show that COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 benefits largely outweigh their risks.",

Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit. Malone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable. The key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.] Experts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.] Ang\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument. \u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d Indeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination. In addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d Fisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d. Some of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said. All three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said. Scientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for. But even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out. There\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations. On the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible. You can read the original Washington Times article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK: Emma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel: I will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this. Viruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease. For most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and\/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms. Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently. But most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape. Thus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both. What\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination. Finally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for. While it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation. In short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination. Finally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza? The base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host. Particularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%. Further, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected). Exposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent. Dale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore: This article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO. Flawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission. Flawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies. Flawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely. Flawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary. It is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice. Ang\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs: The article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place: About assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate. Some of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it! About assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links. It is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination. About assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity. ANNOTATIONS The statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity). \u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data.

        "text":"CLAIM Lancet study showed that vaccinated people have lower immune function than unvaccinated people; COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Kenji Yamamoto, Tucker Carlson, Fox News, The Hodgetwins, 21 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Misrepresents source: The Lancet study cited in the video examined how COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. The study didn\u2019t examine immunity to infectious diseases in general nor did it find that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system. Misleading: The review article by Seneff et al. provided no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system. KEY TAKE AWAY No scientific evidence supports the claim that COVID-19 vaccination weakens the immune system. On the contrary, vaccination helps our immune system to better defend itself against infection. Large-scale clinical trials and scientific studies found that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines outweigh their risks. FULL CLAIM: A Lancet study \u201cshowed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals\u201d; \u201cit's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system\u201d REVIEW On 21 July 2022, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that \u201cit\u2019s looking likely that [COVID-19] vaccines suppress the immune system\u201d. To support that assertion, Carlson cited a review article by Seneff et al. and a comment in Virology Journal by cardiologist Kenji Yamamoto. Carlson\u2019s news segment was shared by political commentators The Hodgetwins and cardiologist Peter McCullough, who previously made false claims about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Political commentator Ben Swann also made the same claim as Carlson in this video on Facebook, citing the same articles. The claim isn\u2019t new; Health Feedback already debunked this claim here, here, and here. Claims like this illustrate how scientific publishing has proven to be an effective vehicle for spreading misinformation, by lending a sheen of credibility to inaccurate and misleading claims and narratives. This review will explain how this iteration of the claim by Carlson relies on speculations that lack scientific evidence as well as misrepresentations of a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet. Article by Seneff et al. claiming that mRNA vaccines cause health problems like cancer is based on speculations that lack supporting evidence In a review article, Seneff et al. claimed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could weaken the immune system through various biological pathways and increase the risk of infection and cancer. It should be noted that its lead author is Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has no training in infectious diseases or vaccines. Seneff has claimed that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been disproven by large-scale scientific studies which have thus far shown no association between vaccination and risk of autism. In an email to Health Feedback, Angeline Rouers, a senior research fellow at the A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs in Singapore, stated that she found the review to be misleading and based on misinterpretation of scientific studies. The authors claimed that the innate immune response, in particular type I interferon, is suppressed because COVID-19 vaccines favor the adaptive immune response instead. However, the fact that COVID-19 vaccination promotes adaptive immunity as opposed to innate immunity isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cIt is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection,\u201d said Rouers. \u201cThe vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection.\u201d Furthermore, the promotion of adaptive immunity by COVID-19 vaccination doesn\u2019t imply the suppression of the innate immune system and \u201chas no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer,\u201d Rouers clarified. [See Rouers\u2019 full remarks here.] Indeed, a group of scientists, led by oncologist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Barriere, published a reply to the review, available on the OSF preprint server, also remarking on the same issue, among others. Barriere et al. wrote that the authors\u2019 claim about type I interferon impairment is based on a preprint[1] showing \u201ca differential gene expression profile in peripheral dendritic cells based on vaccinal status, but do not support the authors\u2019 claim that there is Type I IFN suppression due to the vaccine. Reliable research shows this is simply the reaction expected from a vaccine: a high immune response without a systemic and uncontrolled inflammation\u201d. Jeffrey Morris, professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed the article by Seneff et al. in a Twitter thread. One of the most significant flaws in the article, he pointed out, is that it\u2019s primarily rooted in speculation. For instance, the authors suggested that mRNA vaccination is associated with diseases like herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, and optic neuropathy, even though there\u2019s no evidence that a link exists. The article also claimed to present \u201cevidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health\u201d. While it did discuss several biological pathways, the authors didn\u2019t present evidence demonstrating that these pathways are actually affected by mRNA vaccines. \u201cIn some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines,\u201d Morris said. Interestingly, he observed that much of the evidence cited was related to severe COVID-19, meaning that \u201cmuch content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination\u201d. The authors sought to strengthen their claim about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines by citing reports from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). For example, the authors analyzed VAERS reports of anosmia (loss of smell) and concluded that it was a sign the vaccine caused nerve damage. However, as Morris pointed out, anosmia is common with COVID-19, whereas it isn\u2019t with vaccination. Therefore, these cases of anosmia could be explained by a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. But the authors ignored this possible explanation for their observation. In support of their claim, the authors also cited the fact that VAERS reports related to COVID-19 vaccines made up the majority of reports for 2021 compared to other vaccines like the flu vaccine. However, they failed to account for differences in reporting rates between vaccines and the possibility that people are more likely to file VAERS reports after a COVID-19 vaccine than for other vaccines. A similar claim was addressed by Health Feedback here. By analyzing VAERS reports of various \u201cnegative control events\u201d\u2014events we can safely exclude as being linked to vaccination\u2014such as toothache, limb X-rays, and alopecia (hair loss), Morris found that reporting for COVID-19 vaccines is indeed disproportionately higher than for other vaccines. For example, 97.2% of reports about toothache and 88.3% of reports about limb X-rays were filed after a COVID-19 vaccine. We have no reason to believe that COVID-19 vaccines cause toothache or limb X-rays, meaning that the large proportion of reports attributed to COVID-19 vaccines are the result of people being more likely to report adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, not because COVID-19 vaccines are harmful. Overall, the review presented a series of speculations about how mRNA vaccines might affect health\u2014all in favor of the narrative that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful\u2014but without presenting direct evidence that the changes they speculated would happen actually occur. As Morris pointed out, the review at best provides \u201chypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven\u201d. Furthermore, the responsibility for validating these hypotheses lies with the authors themselves, as Morris pointed out, but instead the authors demanded for public health authorities to prove them wrong\u2014a typical example of shifting the burden of proof. Comment by Yamamoto misrepresented the research and findings of a study in The Lancet by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. Yamamoto\u2019s comment in Virology Journal, published in June 2022, claimed that a Lancet study, published in February 2022, showed \u201cimmune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. Yamamoto also went on to assert that \u201cAs a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued\u201d and that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients\u201d. However, this misrepresents the Lancet study performed by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. The study examined the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death up to nine months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose[2]. It reported that vaccine effectiveness decreased over time, meaning that the protection offered by the vaccines isn\u2019t permanent. It also considered that its findings \u201c[strengthen] the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster, where the priority should be specific populations who are at higher risk of severe consequences of COVID-19 due to weaker and more rapidly waning vaccine-elicited immunogenicity\u201d. This is the complete opposite of Yamamoto\u2019s comment, which inaccurately extrapolated the findings of the study, which were related only to COVID-19, with infectious diseases in general. Other statements raise questions about the scientific credibility of Yamamoto\u2019s comment. In one example, he wrote that \u201cThe media have so far concealed the adverse events of vaccine administration, such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), owing to biased propaganda\u201d. This is false; on the contrary, multiple mainstream media reports about VITT exist, like these by Reuters, the BBC, and the CBC, and have received much attention from both the scientific community and the public. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the risk of blood clots following COVID-19 is higher than after vaccination, as a study of more than 29.1 million people in the UK showed[3]. Yamamoto also claimed that \u201cIt has been hypothesized that there will be an increase in cardiovascular diseases, especially acute coronary syndromes, caused by the spike proteins in genetic vaccines\u201d. One of the scientific references he used to support this claim is an abstract by cardiothoracic surgeon Steven Gundry, which appeared in the medical journal Circulation in November 2021. An abstract is a brief summary of research findings, not a scientific study in itself. Gundry\u2019s abstract received an Expression of Concern from the journal on 24 November 2021. The notice stated that \u201cthere is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used\u201d. In other words, no evidence was presented for the claims made in the abstract. But Yamamoto made no mention of the Expression of Concern or the problems with the abstract. While it is true that certain COVID-19 mRNA vaccines increase the risk of heart inflammation, in particular young men, the risk of heart inflammation and other health problems is much greater after getting COVID-19[4]. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that teenage boys were two to six times more likely to develop heart complications after COVID-19 than after vaccination, while the risk was seven to eight times higher in young men[5]. Overall, the comment entirely misrepresented the findings of a Lancet study and emphasized the risks of COVID-19 vaccination while leaving out the fact that the risks associated with COVID-19 is much higher. It paints a misleading picture of the scientific state of understanding regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, the evidence shows that it is safer to get vaccinated than remain unvaccinated. SCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK Ang\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs: The review by Seneff et al. is misleading and based on a misinterpretation of scientific data. The review is based on independent scientific evidence which are then combined to lead to a false conclusion: mRNA vaccines weaken innate immunity, particularly interferon (IFN) response. It is known that type I IFN, which is part of the innate immune system, is particularly important in cancer. Mutations of IFN-related genes contribute to the development of cancer and IFN is a common therapy to treat tumor growth[6]. As for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, studies have shown that they instead favor the adaptive immune response (antibodies, memory T and B cells). Based on these observations, the authors of the review raised the concern that the innate immune response, particularly the IFN response, is suppressed following vaccination, in contrast to strong inflammation during infection. However, it is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection[1]. The vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection. In the context of vaccination, promoting memory immune responses like B cells is the most important for antiviral immunity[7]. Innate responses have very limited memory and their stimulation via vaccination is less relevant. Furthermore, the limited IFN response following COVID-19 vaccination is not evidence of weakened immunity and has no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer. Thus, the claim that mRNA vaccines weaken the immune system isn\u2019t supported by scientific evidence. Finally, the comment by K. Yamamoto is another misinterpretation of a published study. His comment says: \u201cThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. However, the actual observation of this study is that immunity wanes after vaccination. We already know this and it is this waning that justifies the need for a booster shot. In addition, the study reported that the unvaccinated always have a higher incidence of infection compared to vaccinated. In general, studies support the use of vaccine boosters to reduce the risk of hospitalization, even against Omicron[8]. UPDATE (4 August 2022): The review was updated to include an iteration of the claim by Ben Swann. UPDATE (29 July 2022): Dr. Rouers\u2019 comment was received and included after the initial publication. This comment further supports the original verdict and did not modify it. A reference to the letter by Barriere et al. was also added to the review. REFERENCES",

        "link":"https:\/\/newatlas.com\/energy\/blowhole-wave-energy-generator\/",
        "text":"Wave Swell Energy's remarkable UniWave 200 is a sea platform that uses an artificial blowhole formation to create air pressure changes that drive a turbine and feed energy back to shore. After a year of testing, the company reports excellent results. As we've discussed before, the UniWave system is a floatable device that can be towed to any coastal location and connected to the local energy grid. It's designed so that wave swells force water into a specially designed concrete chamber, pressurizing the air in the chamber and forcing it through an outlet valve. Then as the water recedes, it generates a powerful vacuum, which sucks air in through a turbine at the top and generates electricity that's fed into the grid via a cable. As a result, it draws energy from the entire column of water that enters its chamber, a fact the team says makes it more efficient than wave energy devices that only harvest energy from the surface or the sea floor. The UniWave 200 in place off King Island, Tasmania Wave Swell Energy WSE's key innovation here is that one-way generation; other devices that harvest the same effect use bi-directional turbines, requiring the ability to reverse blade pitch or redirect the airflow. WSE says its design allows for far cheaper and simpler turbines, that should also last longer since they're not getting as much salt water splashed through them when a big wave hits. Indeed, all this device's moving parts are above the waterline, a fact that should help extend its service life as well as making it completely harmless to marine life. Interestingly, the UniWave's design also makes it easy to incorporate into breakwaters and seawalls, where it can take a coastal erosion protection project and turn it into a clean energy source. You can see an animation showing how it works in the video below. WSE Technology and King Island Project A 200-kW test platform was installed last year off King Island, facing the notoriously rough seas of Bass Strait, which separates the island state of Tasmania from the mainland of Australia. There, it's been contributing reliable clean energy to the island's microgrid around the clock for a full 12 months. The WSE team has made a few live tweaks to the design during operation, improving its performance beyond original expectations. \u201cWe set out to prove that Wave Swell\u2019s wave energy converter technology could supply electricity to a grid in a range of wave conditions, and we have done that,\u201d said WSE CEO Paul Geason in a press release. \"One key achievement has been to deliver real-world results in Tasmanian ocean conditions to complement the AMC test modeling. In some instances, the performance of our technology in the ocean has exceeded expectations due to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt through the project, technological improvements and the refinements we have made over the course of the year.\" \"Our team is excited to have achieved a rate of conversion from wave power to electricity at an average of 45 to 50% in a wide range of wave conditions,\" he continues. \"This is a vast improvement on past devices and shows that the moment has arrived for wave power to sit alongside wind, solar and energy storage as part of a modern energy mix.\" We asked Geason over email how much energy the device generated during the trial. \"It's important to stress that the demonstration at King Island was not about producing high volumes of electricity,\" he responds. \"Rather, it was to prove the capabilities of our technology in a variety of wave conditions. The results have met and at times exceeded our expectations. As an example, when the unit is generating 40 kW of power in reasonable wave conditions, you could extrapolate the amount of energy to be in the order of 1MWh in a 24 hour period.\" The UniWave can turn erosion protection projects into clean power sources Wave Swell Energy The King Island platform will remain in place at least until the end of 2022, and the company is now gearing up to go into production. \"Having proven our device can survive the toughest conditions the Southern Ocean and Bass Strait can throw at it, and deliver grid compliant electricity, our priority now shifts to commercializing the technology,\" said Gleason. \"For Wave Swell this means ensuring the market embraces the WSE technology and units are deployed to deliver utility scale clean electricity to mainland grids around the world.\u201d Geason tells New Atlas that commercial deployments could vary in size. \"The units can scale up from 200 kW,\" he writes. \"Exact size will depend upon the attributes of the wave climate at any particular location. The sweet spot, as you put it, will be site dependent. We're currently engaged with a number of third parties that are seeking to deploy commercial units, and our efforts and resources are focused on further deployments and commercialization of our technology.\" See the UniWave 200 test platform running in the video below.

        "text":"The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place. This article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence. Many of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories: 1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk\/mortality rates 9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines 14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness 21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science 24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc. With that out of the way, let\u2019s do this. Bad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous Reality: Yes it is; millions are dead Over 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Bad argument #2: 99.9% survive Reality: That still means millions of deaths The survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way. More details here Bad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low\/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities. Reality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID Comorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions). More details here. Bad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu Reality: Yes it is In the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu. Bad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine Reality: You can still become seriously ill and\/or spread it to others Being young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #). Also see #25 Bad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines Reality: Your immune system is only as good as its training Even a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d Details here Bad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines Reality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died. Homo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines. More details here Bad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t Reality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous Early evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations. Bad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA Reality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering. DNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you. More details here Bad argument #10: The vaccines are too new\/rushed Reality: No, they aren\u2019t\/weren\u2019t More details here and here Bad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects Reality: Yes, we do No vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will. More details here and here Bad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine Reality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing Again, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies. Bad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated Reality: They are safer with vaccines Hospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022). In contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022). Bad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective Reality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful This one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16). More details here and here. Bad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases) Reality: They reduce risk and severity Again, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)! This argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident. If you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs. Update 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine. Bad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID Reality: They reduce risk of transmission Vaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you. Bad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated Reality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers This claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15). More details here and here Bad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron Reality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness Omicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021). See #20 on boosters Bad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated? Reality: Because I care about others Vaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc. Bad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three Reality: So what? Why is that a problem? Bad argument #21: But science has been wrong before Reality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works Science is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines. Details here and here. Also, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus Reality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right Galileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21). Details here and here and here. Bad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe Reality: No there wasn\u2019t This is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22). See posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies\/It\u2019s all about money Reality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d I don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other See posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument. Bad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes] Reality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science The fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation. Additionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet. More details here and here and here. Bad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS Reality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem VAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25). More details here Bad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines Reality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks Adverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021). See studies cited in #10, 13\u201316 Bad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories\/FDA corruption Reality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories Conspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health\/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd. Bad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice\/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates Reality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health This is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers). Bad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026 Reality: Those are not good sources Please just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2021\/08\/30\/future-long-term-side-effects-from-covid-vaccines-are-extremely-unlikely\/",
        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited",

        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited",

        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited",

        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited",

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2021\/07\/27\/the-99-survive-covid-argument-is-deceptive-and-completely-misses-the-point\/",
        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited",

        "text":"I\u2019ve been a fan of Jon Stewart for a long time. I usually find him to be both funny and insightful. It was, therefore, with great dismay that I watched him spread a conspiracy theory and inaccuracies about science on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and I regret that it is now my duty to explain his errors. In the clip, which you can see here, Stewart begins by saying that we owe a great debt to science for helping to ameliorate the COVID19 crisis. That much I absolutely agree with. Scientists deserve an enormous amount of gratitude for developing the vaccines that are currently saving lives and reducing suffering around the world. Unfortunately, the interview quickly took a turn for a worse as Stewart endorsed the conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID19 escaped from the lab in Wuhan and made numerous dangerous, false statements about how scientists operate. Mischaracterizations of science and scientists Before I get to the conspiracy theory, I want to respond to a more general comment he made which really bothered me, because it is a common and damaging misconception about science and scientists. He said, \u201cThis is the problem with science. Science is incredible, but they don\u2019t know where to stop, and nobody in the room with those cats ever goes, \u2018ya know, I don\u2019t know if we should do that.\u2019\u201d This is an inherently untrue statement that is, unfortunately, a very common misconception about science, perhaps most famously stated by Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park as, \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d In reality, most of us scientists spend a great deal of time thinking about the implications of our work and whether it is a good idea, and even if we didn\u2019t want to do that, we are forced to do that by ethics committees. The days of \u201cmad scientists\u201d operating in isolation doing dangerous, unethical experiments are long gone. In modern science, you have to submit proposals before you do research, and those proposals get reviewed by ethics boards (which, btw, usually include scientists and non-scientists) who will approve, reject, or insist on modifications to your proposal. If you get approved, you then have to submit reports on what you actually did, and there are usually audits. Further, if you want to work with something dangerous, you often need additional government clearance and approval. Things are checked and regulated, particularly in a major lab like the one in Wuhan. Indeed, Stewart went on to give an example that undercut his whole argument. In a deranged monologue in which he asserted (I hope jokingly) that scientists would be the death of humanity, he inaccurately described scientists\u2019 re-animation of the virus that caused the 1918 flu, \u201cThey had a little sample of [the virus], and it hadn\u2019t been a scourge in the earth for 100 years, and they thought to themselves, \u2018what if we just, I don\u2019t know, woke it up?\u2019 And nobody in the room was like, \u2018No. Let\u2019s not do that.'\u201d The reality of the situation was quite different. The research was conducted by the CDC and went through both an Institutional Biosafety Committee review and an Animal Care and Use Committee review before being conducted. The risks and benefits were carefully thought out, evaluated, and discussed by several groups of people, and very strict bio-safety guidelines were put in place and followed. This wasn\u2019t a scientist working in their garage doing whatever popped into their head. It was, carefully planned, well-thought out, closely monitored, rigorously controlled research in a secure, state-of-the-art laboratory (you can read the details on the CDC\u2019s website). To be 100% clear, that obviously does not mean that no one ever goes rogue and operates outside of the system. There will always be people who break the rules, but those cases are rare, they are pretty close to impossible at a lab facility like Wuhan, and when those people get caught, the consequences are generally serious (such as loss of funding, loss of job, and sometimes prosecution). So, this notion that no one is telling scientists not to do things is simply false. There are constantly people checking our proposals and telling us not to do things. This misconception matters, because it paints scientists as people who are totally disconnected from reality, blindly doing whatever interests us regardless of the dangers, but that\u2019s a caricature, not reality. Scientists are normal people. We think about things like ethics and broad implications, and we have people checking us. Further, this sort of caricature downplays the importance of labs like the Wuhan lab. It\u2019s not full of \u201cmad scientists.\u201d It\u2019s full of incredibly intelligent, thoughtful people doing important work that needs to be done if we are going to prevent future disease outbreaks and mitigate the ones that we fail to prevent. Indeed, that Spanish Flu research that Stewart mocked gave us important insights into how highly virulent pathogens operate, and those insights help us to prepare for future outbreaks. This sort of mischaracterization of scientists undermines the critical work that scientists do. The lab leak conspiracy theory Moving on, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail debunking the Wuhan lab leak conspiracy theory, because it has been thoroughly covered elsewhere (e.g., Siegel 2021). Instead, I\u2019ll just hit a few highlights and point out some errors in Stewart\u2019s reasoning. Before I start, I do realize that much of what he said was deliberate hyperbole for comedic effect, so I have no intention of nitpicking his jokes and will instead focus on the broad strokes. The crux of his argument was basically just proximity: There is a lab in Wuhan that studies novel coronaviruses The novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan Therefore, it escaped from the lab To anyone familiar with logic, this reasoning is clearly fallacious. It\u2019s a non sequitur fallacy. Just because the two things occurred in proximity doesn\u2019t mean that there was any relationship between them (note: you might argue that this is a correlation fallacy, but that generally involves trends, not isolated incidents; it is arguably a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy [i.e., there was a lab in Wuhan, then there was an outbreak; therefore the lab caused the outbreak]). It is entirely possible for the co-occurrence of two things to be a coincidence, or for there to be some other factor that caused those two things to line up. In this case, the latter is true. Infectious disease labs very often focus on the pathogens around them, and as Colbert tried to point out to Stewart, China has many coronaviruses, and Wuhan is a massive city with an active wildlife trade. In other words, if a novel coronavirus was going to jump to humans, we would expect it to be in a city like Wuhan, which is why there was a coronavirus lab in Wuhan. As one virologist (Vincent Munster) commented, \u201cNine out of ten times, when there\u2019s a new outbreak, you\u2019ll find a lab that will be working on these kinds of viruses nearby\u201d (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). So, no, the fact that the outbreak originated in a city that has a coronavirus lab does not suggest that the outbreak was a result of a lab leak. That is extremely circumstantial evidence and totally ignores the fact that labs are often positioned in the areas where we\u2019d expect an outbreak. Similarly, Stewart dismissed the abundance of bats around Wuhan by pointing out that there are also lots of bats in Texas, but the outbreak didn\u2019t start there. This is more specious logic (indeed, it\u2019s a reductio ad absurdum fallacy). It\u2019s not simply that there are bats in China, but rather that China is a hot spot of human-wildlife interactions. It is those interactions that are problematic and, it is something scientists have been warning about for years. Back in 2007, a paper in Clinical Microbiology Reviews said, \u201cThe presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb\u201d (Cheng et al. 2007). This isn\u2019t a virus that came out of nowhere with no warnings. It\u2019s something scientists have worried about for a long time, which, once again, is why labs that study these diseases are so important, and why it is so dangerous to undercut them by spreading this kind of conspiracy theory. It\u2019s also, again, why this lab was in China. As you can hopefully see, Stewart\u2019s arguments are bogus, but what should we make of the lab leak hypothesis more generally? As I said, I\u2019m not going to go into a ton of detail, because that is a whole series of posts in itself, but here are a few highlights. First, the WHO investigation into the Wuhan laboratory concluded that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the virus had escaped from the lab. Second, scientific assessments of the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 have shown that it is most likely natural. Andersen et al. (2020) found no evidence to suggest that it was man-made and, \u201cstrong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.\u201d If the virus was engineered, we\u2019d see evidence of that in the genome, but we don\u2019t see that evidence. This is critical, because it means that even if it escaped from a lab, it was probably a natural virus that was being stored there, not one that was engineered. As you will see, however, the arguments for the lab leak hypothesis generally center around the virus not being natural (you can read more about this research and how we know the virus wasn\u2019t man-made in these articles: Bryner 2020; Hayes 2020; Saey 2020). So, where does this leave the lab-leak hypothesis? It leaves it solidly in the territory of conspiracy theories that ignore official reports, cherry pick experts, and spin fanciful tales that attempt to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d based on circumstantial evidence. This hypothesis inherently requires that scientists and governments have lied and falsified records, but there is no actual evidence of that happening. It is just something that has to be blindly assumed in order for this conspiracy theory to be possible, and as a scientist, I have an aversion to making more assumptions than necessary. The more scientific arguments for the lab leak hypothesis have tended to focus either on the fact that we have yet to find the original virus in the wild yet or on an unusual CGG-CGG sequence. The fact that we have not confirmed the original host is, however, hardly surprising. It often takes many years to track novel virus back to the original host. It took 14 years to find the origin of the SARS epidemic (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). So, 1.5 years of failed searching is hardly enough to conclude that it probably isn\u2019t natural. The other argument is that the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 has a CGG-CGG sequence that is unusual. CGG codes for the amino acid arginine, but there are several other ways to produce arginine, and CGG is relatively uncommon in coronavirus. This led David Baltimore to famously refer to the double CGG as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that the virus was man made. That statement was, however, misleading, because about 3% of the arginine sequences in SARS-CoV-2 are CGG, and CGG is found in plenty of other coronaviruses. It is, therefore, entirely possible for CGG-CGG to arise naturally, and even Baltimore has now acknowledged that it could be natural (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). Dr. Anderson, who wrote the study I mentioned earlier, explained the situation in more detail, here. Finally, what are we to make of various governments and even Dr. Fauci saying there should be thorough investigations? First, as I explained in a previous post this week, we should never conflate government decisions with scientific evidence. Second, if people like Fauci want more investigations, I don\u2019t really object (I don\u2019t think they are necessary, but I\u2019m not going to rant in opposition of them either). However, critically, as it stands right now, the weight of evidence is strongly against the lab leak hypothesis, and arguments to the contrary inevitably stray into the realm of conspiracy theories, conjecture, and baseless assumptions. As such, it is extremely problematic for a man like Stewart to insist on national television that the virus originated in a lab. Look, if you want to say, \u201cthe current evidence suggests that it did not escape the lab, but out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of being as certain as possible, we should conduct another investigation\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with that, but that is a very, very different thing from the type of proclamation that Stewart made or the types of conspiracy theories that I\u2019m seeing online. Further, it absolutely does not justify Stewart\u2019s rant about what he perceives as the dangers of science. Let me conclude this with a question. If you doubt the official reports and want another investigation, will you accept the results of that investigation if it shows the disease was natural? To put that another way, how many investigations are required to convince you? This is a question that is worth thinking about. It is always a good idea to ask yourself what it would take to convince you that you were wrong. Update 1-Sept-2021: A new review paper (Holmes et al. 2021) which was released after this post has reviewed the evidence for the lab leak hypothesis in even more detail, and concluded that the evidence strongly points away from that hypothesis.

        "text":"Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on. First, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death. Let\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor. By way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived. Even so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID. To give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it. On the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza\/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID! *Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza\/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions. By way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19. It is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles. So now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition. Do you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about. Having said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities. As others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2021\/07\/27\/the-99-survive-covid-argument-is-deceptive-and-completely-misses-the-point\/",
        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited",

        "text":"Joint Press Release The energy crisis arising from the war in Ukraine may lead to further setbacks Washington, June 1, 2022 \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic has been a key factor in slowing progress toward universal energy access. Globally, 733 million people still have no access to electricity, and 2.4 billion people still cook using fuels detrimental to their health and the environment. At the current rate of progress, 670 million people will remain without electricity by 2030 \u2013 10 million more than projected last year. The 2022 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report shows that the impacts of the pandemic, including lockdowns, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. Advances have been impeded particularly in the most vulnerable countries and those already lagging in energy access. Nearly 90 million people in Asia and Africa who had previously gained access to electricity, can no longer afford to pay for their basic energy needs. The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on energy have been compounded in the last few months by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to uncertainty in global oil and gas markets and has sent energy prices soaring. Africa remains the least electrified in the world with 568 million people without electricity access. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of the global population without electricity jumped to 77 percent in 2020 from 71 percent in 2018 whereas most other regions saw declines in their share of the access deficits. While 70 million people globally gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, this progress was not enough to keep pace with population growth, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cInternational public financing for renewable energy needs to accelerate, especially in the poorest, most vulnerable countries. We have failed to support those most in need. With only eight years left to achieve universal access to affordable and sustainable energy, we need radical actions to accelerate the increase of international public financial flows and distribute them in a more equitable manner, so 733 million people who are currently left behind can enjoy the benefits of clean energy access.\u201d \u2014 Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) The report finds that despite continued disruptions in economic activity and supply chains, renewable energy was the only energy source to grow through the pandemic. However, these positive global and regional trends in renewable energy have left behind many countries most in need of electricity. This was aggravated by a decrease in international financial flows for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019. SDG7 targets also cover energy efficiency. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent. This is well below the levels needed to meet SDG 7\u2019s targets and to make up for lost ground, the average rate of improvement would have to jump to 3.2 percent. In September 2021, the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy brought together governments and stakeholders to accelerate action to achieve a sustainable energy future that leaves no one behind. In this context, the SDG 7 custodian agencies, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), as they launch this report, are urging the international community and policymakers to safeguard gains toward SDG 7; to remain committed to continued action towards affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all; and to maintain a strategic focus on countries needing the most support. Key highlights on SDG 7 targets Access to electricity. The share of the world\u2019s population with access to electricity rose from 83 percent in 2010 to 91 percent in 2020, increasing the number of people with access by 1.3 billion globally. The number without access declined from 1.2 billion people in 2010 to 733 million in 2020. However, the pace of progress in electrification has slowed in recent years which may be explained by the increasing complexity of reaching more remote and poorer unserved populations and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting the 2030 target requires increasing the number of new connections to 100 million a year. At current rates of progress, the world will reach only 92 percent electrification by 2030. Between 2010 and 2020, every region of the world showed consistent progress in electrification, but with wide disparities. Electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 46 percent in 2018 to 48 percent in 2020, but the region\u2019s share of the global access deficit rose from 71 percent in 2018 to 77 percent in 2020, whereas most other regions, including Central and Southern Asia, saw declines in their share of the access deficits. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for more than three-quarters of the people (568 million people) who remained without access in 2020. Clean cooking. The share of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies rose to 69% in 2020, an increase of 3 percentage points over last year. However, population growth outpaced much of the gains in access, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the total number of people lacking access to clean cooking has remained relatively stagnant for decades. Between 2000 and 2010, this number was close to three billion people, or one-third of the global population. It dropped to around 2.4 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in access in large, populous countries in Asia. In contrast, the access deficit in Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly doubled since 1990, reaching a total of around 923 million people in 2020. A multisectoral, coordinated effort is needed to achieve the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It is critical that the global community learns from the successes and challenges faced by countries that have attempted to design and implement clean household energy policies. Renewables. Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy implies accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity, heat, and transport. Although there is no quantitative target for SDG 7.2, custodian agencies agree that the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) needs to rise significantly, even though renewable energy consumption did continue to grow through the pandemic, overcoming disruptions to economic activity and supply chains. While the share of renewable capacity expansion rose by a record amount in 2021, the positive global and regional trajectories mask the fact that countries where new capacity additions lagged were those most in need of increased access. Moreover, rising commodity, energy and shipping prices, as well as restrictive trade measures, have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, and biofuels, adding uncertainty for future renewable energy projects. Renewable shares need to reach well over 30 percent of TFEC by 2030, up from 18 percent in 2019, to be on track for reaching net-zero energy emissions by 2050. Achieving this objective would require strengthening policy support in all sectors and implementing effective tools to further mobilize private capital, especially in least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing countries. Energy efficiency. SDG 7.3 aims to double the global rate of annual improvement in primary energy intensity\u2014the amount of energy used per unit of wealth created\u2014to 2.6 percent in 2010\u201330 versus 1990\u20132010. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent, well below the target, and the average annual rate of improvement now has to reach 3.2 percent to make up for lost ground. This rate would need to be even higher\u2014consistently over 4 percent for the rest of this decade\u2014if the world is to reach net-zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050, as envisioned in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Early estimates for 2020 point to a substantial decrease in intensity improvement because of the COVID-19 crisis, as a result of a higher share of energy-intensive activities in the economy and lower energy prices. The outlook for 2021 suggests a return to a 1.9 percent rate of improvement, the average rate during the previous decade, thanks to a sharper focus on energy efficiency policies, particularly in COVID-19 recovery packages. However, energy efficiency policies and investment need to be scaled up significantly to bring the SDG 7.3 target within reach. International Financial Flows. International public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy decreased for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019, despite the immense needs for sustainable development in most countries and growing urgency of climate change. The amount was down by nearly 24 per cent from the previous year and may be worsened by the pandemic in 2020. Overall, the level of financing remains below what is needed to reach SDG 7, particularly in the most vulnerable and least developed countries. The decrease was seen in most regions, with the only exception in Oceania, where international public flows rose by 72 percent. The bulk of decreases were concentrated in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, where they fell 66.2 percent; Latin America and the Caribbean, where they dropped by 29.8 percent; and Central and Southern Asia, where they declined by 24.5 percent. Although the private sector finances most renewable energy investments, public finance remains key to attract private capital, including for creating an enabling environment for private investments, developing the needed infrastructure, and addressing perceived and real risks and barriers for investments in the energy transition. International public flows to countries that lack the financial resources to support their energy transitions constitute a large part of the international collaboration that will be needed for a global energy transition that would bring the world closer to achieving all SDGs. Indicators and data for tracking progress. Tracking global progress for SDG 7 targets requires high-quality, reliable and comparable data for informed and effective policymaking at the global, regional, and country levels. The quality of data has been improving through national and international cooperation and solid statistical capacity. National data systems improve as countries establish legal frameworks and institutional arrangements for comprehensive data collection for energy supply and demand balances; implement end-user surveys (e.g., households, businesses, etc.); and develop quality-assurance frameworks. However, after the pandemic hit and disrupted the rate of progress toward Goal 7, more investment in quality statistics is needed to know where we stand and how to get back on track. This is especially important for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries, to inform their national energy policies and strategies to ensure no one is left behind.

        "text":"Virology Joseph Osmundson W.W. Norton & Co., $16.95 As a journalist covering COVID-19, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the pandemic. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed with despair over the death and suffering. I\u2019ve been numb, trying to keep up with the deluge of COVID-19 studies. One balm has been the understanding of colleagues who also report on COVID-19. I found solace too in Virology, microbiologist Joseph Osmundson\u2019s book of 11 wide-ranging essays, in which he writes of the pandemic and calls for \u201ca new rhetoric of care.\u201d Osmundson includes journal entries from the pandemic, and some of his experi\u00adences are similar to mine. He dreams he\u2019s at a gathering where no one is masked. He too felt the \u201cdensity\u201d of the pandemic: \u201cEmotionally dense, with loss and struggle and even some\u00adtimes joy,\u201d he writes. \u201cScientifically dense, with papers and pre-prints out every day that need reading and some analysis.\u201d Osmundson doesn\u2019t just focus on the coronavirus. He jumps from other viruses and the immune system to illness and metaphors for illness, to sex and HIV, to archiving history and whose stories get told. Parts of the book feel like an anthology, with quotes from many writers who have weighed in on these topics. Parts are a call to care for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, wealth or who one loves.

There was a problem signing you up. Overall, Osmundson questions how society thinks about viruses. \u201cViruses \u2026 are not evil, they don\u2019t invade. They just are,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe meaning we give a virus affects how we live with it.\u201d When we describe viruses as enemies and illness as a war, it \u201cassumes the necessity of casualties.\u201d He argues instead to focus resources on caring for one another. Born in the early 1980s, Osmundson, a gay man, is acutely aware of the messages that come with viruses. \u201cOur generation of gay men came after the plague,\u201d he writes. \u201cHIV didn\u2019t just kill bodies. It killed a type of sex as well, a type of pleasure.\u201d But new therapies have saved lives and altered perceptions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can prevent infection, while treatment can render HIV untransmissible (SN: 11\/15\/19). These advances changed our relationship with the virus, Osmundson writes. \u201cI used to think that HIV would make it harder to find love and sex. Now we know that HIV-positive and undetectable is safe. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d But the biomedicine that can change our relationship with viruses has not been wielded equitably, Osmundson observes. He returns throughout the book to our common humanity. \u201cThat fact of all our bodies, vulnerable together, necessitates mutual care.\u201d Buy Virology from Bookshop.org.

        "title":"experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases",
        "text":"After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 \u2014 including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of are-they-just-colds? scares and lots of negative tests \u2014 I recently tested positive. It felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now \u201cit.\u201d COVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I still wore my mask inside public spaces (SN: 3\/25\/22). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold. Two thick lines on my rapid test said otherwise (SN: 12\/17\/21). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what? These are my results the day I tested positive for COVID-19. I took two rapid at-home tests just to be extra sure \u2014 and then got a PCR test from a testing site so my results could be included in official case counts. A. Gibbs I had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house. It got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn\u2019t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought. When it comes to reporting at-home tests, \u201cthere is no formal recommendation,\u201d says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it\u2019s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won\u2019t. That\u2019s problematic: Now that at-home tests are free and easy to access, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test. Cases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn\u2019t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\u2019s data show that only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled \u201cCan we trust case numbers?\u201d To make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test. But until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we\u2019re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what\u2019s going on in your community, though. For starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community monitors wastewater, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. Outbreaks Near Me, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.

There was a problem signing you up. In general, \u201cbe aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,\u201d Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: \u201cIf you start to hear, like, \u2018Hey, you know, I\u2019ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,\u2019 that\u2019s probably a really good indicator \u2026 that there\u2019s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.\u201d And that it\u2019s a good time to start taking extra precautions again. Speaking of precautions, according to the isolation guidelines put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can still be contagious after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others? Turns out it\u2019s a complicated question. There\u2019s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator \u2014 albeit imperfect \u2014 of current contagiousness. (That\u2019s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.) How contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC\u2019s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days. But several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms, about half of the players still showed significant viral load. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that 43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,\u201d Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. \u201cI would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,\u201d Mina says. \u201cThat was based on old data.\u201d Instead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you\u2019re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there\u2019s likely less virus in your body. But because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, \u201cyou should assume that you\u2019re infectious\u201d if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you\u2019ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative. By my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be. I wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it\u2019s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, not enough knowledge to make such decisions (SN: 6\/16\/21). \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be confused about all this,\u201d Mina says. \u201cI think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.\u201d Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds. As for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina\u2019s advice on testing negative twice, I\u2019m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci",
        "text":"For some people, including President Joe Biden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, the relief of vanishing COVID-19 symptoms and a negative test is fleeting. Biden, Fauci and many others have seen their tests turn positive again or have unwelcome symptoms return after taking a five-day course of the antiviral Paxlovid. Other people, including my husband, have had their infections rebound even without taking the drug. Multiple studies have described cases of \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d after treatment. In one, seven Paxlovid-treated patients had the virus rebound to high levels after treatment ended, and symptoms returned for six of them, virologist Jonathan Li and colleagues reported in June in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Samples from three patients even carried infectious virus, a clue that some people who rebound might infect others. Another study that has yet to be peer-reviewed by other researchers found that fewer than 6 percent of people in the study who\u2019d been prescribed Paxlovid had rebound infections in the month after finishing treatment. Sign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. It\u2019s unclear why Paxlovid rebound happens, says Li, of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Studies show that people given the drug still develop a strong immune response to the virus after five days of treatment. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening in that situation is that you\u2019ve got virus replication that\u2019s been inhibited. All of a sudden, the drug has disappeared and the virus has a momentary opportunity to replicate. And it replicates to high levels,\u201d Li says. But by then, the immune system has learned to fend off the coronavirus. If the recently trained immune cells encounter newly made viruses and set off alarm bells, symptoms may briefly come back. Some people might not want to take the drug because they\u2019re worried about rebound, Li says. But Paxlovid itself probably isn\u2019t the cause. The drug\u2019s not failing. It is still highly effective in preventing severe disease. \u201cI would not hesitate to give my patients Paxlovid,\u201d Li says. \u201cI do tell them to be on the lookout for rebounding symptoms. But it doesn\u2019t dissuade me in terms of prescribing it.\u201d Fauci took another course of Paxlovid in the wake of his rebound. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that there\u2019s no evidence that 10 days of treatment is any more effective than five days, or that patients need a repeat. But, researchers are testing whether taking the drug for a longer period of time might prevent rebound. Rebounding COVID-19 isn\u2019t limited to patients who take Paxlovid. Li recalls that even in the early days of the pandemic, some patients would come to him in the hospital saying that they\u2019d started to feel better but got worse again. It\u2019s hard to know how to interpret such anecdotal reports, he says. Researchers are still learning what an untreated viral infection can look like in the body. While the virus\u2019s (hopefully) brief invasion may appear straightforward on average \u2014 with virus levels in the body increasing to a peak before slowly declining as the person recovers \u2014 not everyone follows that pattern. My husband got COVID-19 two months ago. His symptoms lasted about a week, and he was delighted to see the line on his antigen test getting fainter. Even so, despite feeling perfectly healthy, the line was suddenly back at full strength almost immediately after he added his sample to a new test days later. He was frustrated and, as a social person, lamented having to stay isolated. Studies show he\u2019s not alone. When Li and colleagues studied the course of disease in COVID-19 clinical trial participants who received a placebo treatment, 1 in 8 people experienced a rebound, with symptoms coming back for 1 in 4 people. That rebound, however, typically lasted about a day, and few had both high viral loads and returning symptoms, the team reports in a preliminary study posted August 2 at medRxiv.org that hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists. In this case, there\u2019s no disappearing drug. Any returning symptoms without a positive test might be from something else such as allergies or a different respiratory virus, Li says. It\u2019s also possible that the virus is replicating in different parts of the body at different times. Some tests might end up negative when the body eliminates virus from the throat, for example, but it\u2019s still replicating at low levels in the nose. That latter scenario may have happened with my husband. In a confusing twist, he tested negative on two saliva PCR tests while continuing to test positive on nasal antigen tests. A PCR test is far more sensitive, so we expected the opposite to happen. Since experts say to consider a positive antigen test as a sign you\u2019re still contagious, he stayed isolated until he finally tested negative on an antigen test two weeks after his first symptoms appeared. Luckily, he\u2019s fully recovered now, and not at all eager for a repeat experience. That means we\u2019re both still masking in public spaces and taking other precautions. We know we\u2019re not done with this pandemic.",

Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\/Patrick O'Neill Riley This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article, which was published April 19, 2022. You want to sit down for an indoor dinner with friends. A couple of years ago, this was a simple enough activity that required minimal planning. However, that is not the case in today\u2019s world. Many people now face a stream of further considerations about benefits and risks. Will I enjoy the experience? What are the potential downsides? Am I comfortable with the restaurant\u2019s pandemic-related policies? What\u2019s the ventilation like? Is it very busy there at this time of day? Am I planning to see lots of people, or people with compromised immune systems, in the near future? This is exhausting! As scientists at the Learning and Decision-Making Lab at Rutgers University-Newark, we\u2019ve noticed how many decision-making processes are affected by the pandemic. The accumulation of choices people are making throughout the day leads to what psychologists call decision fatigue \u2013 you can end up feeling overwhelmed and make bad decisions. The current pandemic can make this situation more pronounced, as even the choices and activities that should be the most simple can now feel tinged with risk and uncertainty. Risk involves known probabilities \u2013 for example, the likelihood of losing a certain hand in poker. But uncertainty is an unknown probability \u2013 you can never really know the exact chance of catching COVID-19 by engaging in certain activities. Human beings tend to be both risk-averse and uncertainty-averse, meaning that you likely avoid both when you can. And when you can\u2019t \u2013 as during a confusing phase of a pandemic \u2013 it can be draining to try to decide what to do. Rules are easy, decisions are hard Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most people didn\u2019t think through some basic decisions in the same way they might now. In fact, even early in the pandemic you didn\u2019t really need to. There were rules to follow whether you liked them or not. Capacity was limited, hours were restricted, or shops were closed. People were strongly urged to opt out of activities they\u2019d normally engage in. This is evident in data we collected from university students in fall 2020 and spring 2021. One question we asked was, \u201cWhat has been the hardest part of the pandemic for you?\u201d Responses included \u201cNot being able to see my friends and family,\u201d \u201cHaving to take classes online,\u201d \u201cBeing forced to stay home\u201d and many other similar frustrations. Many of our survey respondents were either not able to do things they wanted to do or were forced to do things they didn\u2019t want to do. In either case, the guidelines were clear-cut and the decisions were less of a struggle. As restrictions ease and people think about \u201cliving with\u201d the coronavirus, the current phase of the pandemic brings with it a new need to make cost-benefit calculations. It\u2019s important to remember that not everyone has experienced these kinds of decisions in the same way. Throughout the course of the pandemic there have been people who did not have the luxury of choice and needed to go to work regardless of the risk. There have also been those who have taken risks all along. On the other end of the spectrum, some people continue to stay isolated and avoid almost every situation with the potential for contracting COVID-19. Those who experience the most decision fatigue are those who are in the middle \u2013 they want to avoid COVID-19 but also want to get back to the activities they enjoyed before the pandemic. Shortcuts can short-circuit decision-making Psychologist Daniel Kahneman wrote in his book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d that \u201cwhen faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead.\u201d Making decisions about risk and uncertainty is hard. For instance, trying to think through the probability of catching a potentially deadly virus while going to an indoor movie theater is difficult. So people tend to think in terms of binaries \u2013 \u201cthis is safe\u201d or \u201cthis is unsafe\u201d \u2013 because it\u2019s easier. The problem is that answering easier questions instead of trickier ones leaves you vulnerable to cognitive biases, or errors in thought that affect your decision-making. One of the most prevalent of these biases is the availability heuristic. That\u2019s what psychologists call the tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind. How much a certain event is covered in the media, or whether you\u2019ve seen instances of it recently in your life, can sway your estimate. For example, if you\u2019ve seen stories of a plane crash in the news recently, you may believe the probability of being in a plane crash to be higher than it actually is. The effect of the availability heuristic on pandemic-era decision-making often manifests as making choices based on individual cases rather than on overall trends. On one side, people may feel fine going to a crowded indoor concert because they know others in their lives who have done this and have been fine \u2013 so they judge the likelihood of catching the coronavirus to be lower as a result. On the other hand, someone who knows a friend whose child caught COVID-19 at school may now think the risks of transmission in schools are much higher than they really are. Furthermore, the availability heuristic means these days you think much more about the risks of catching COVID-19 than about other risks life entails that receive less media attention. While you\u2019re worrying about the adequacy of a restaurant\u2019s ventilation system, you overlook the danger of getting into a car accident on your way there. A constant process Decisions in general, and during a pandemic in particular, are about weighing risks and benefits and dealing with risk and uncertainty. Because of the nature of probability, you can\u2019t be sure in advance whether you\u2019ll catch COVID-19 after agreeing to dine at a friend\u2019s house. Furthermore, the outcome does not make your decision right or wrong. If you weigh the risks and benefits and accept that dinner invitation, only to end up contracting COVID-19 at the meal, it doesn\u2019t mean you made the wrong decision \u2013 it just means you rolled the dice and came up short. On the flip side, if you accept the dinner invitation and don\u2019t end up with COVID-19, don\u2019t get too smug; another time, the outcome might be different. All you can do is try to weigh what you know of the costs and benefits and make the best decisions you can. During this next phase of the pandemic, we recommend remembering that uncertainty is a part of life. Be kind to yourself and others as we all try to make our best choices.

Dog sledding, skijoring, bikejoring, or any activity involving pulling and running are especially well suited for the breed. Siberian Huskies are generally not great swimmers or retrievers. Exercise must be done on lead or in a safe area, as these dogs tend to roam and may not return when called. The breed can be extremely clever about escaping, so a secure yard is required. Siberians are known for damaging homes when not adequately exercised or when left alone for too long. Young dogs are prone to destruction and should be enclosed in a damage-proof area. The breed relishes cold weather and is prone to overheating in hot conditions. The thick coat requires brushing weekly, daily (even twice daily) during shedding season. Because the breed is self-cleaning, baths are usually only needed several times a year. Temperament The Siberian Husky is active, independent, mischievous, and playful. It gets along fairly well with other dogs and pets and is outgoing toward strangers. Because of their friendly nature, Siberians do not make good guard dogs. The breed enjoys people of all ages but is too independent and strong to be a good walking companion for children or the elderly. It tends to be strong-willed and is not an easy dog to train. While Siberians do not tend to bark much, they are far from quiet, emitting a wide variety of \u201cwoos,\u201d chirps, and howls. It should be noted that these claims are traditional and widely accepted generalizations about the breed, and the behaviour of individual Siberians may differ.

        "text":"Abstract The Director\u2019s 2021 annual report on the work of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (the Bureau), Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization, highlights the technical cooperation undertaken by the Bureau during the period from July 2020 to June 2021, within the framework of the 2020\u20132025 Strategic Plan of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The theme of the report is: Working through the COVID-19 Pandemic. The period covered has been the most challenging ever encountered by PAHO. The pandemic, through its devastating health and economic consequences, has severely impacted people\u2019s lives and livelihoods and disrupted countries, societies, economies, and their development. This has occurred in conjunction with the inevitable challenges on the road to equitable, sustainable development and the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas 2018\u20132030. The publication opens with a preface by the Director of PASB, a concise executive summary, and a brief introduction. It then presents a comprehensive review of PAHO\u2019s technical cooperation, and of the Bureau\u2019s institutional and strengthening functions. The report highlights achievements, challenges, and lessons learned as the Bureau undertook technical cooperation with PAHO Member States at national, subregional, and regional levels within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, working with traditional and new partners to find equitable solutions for emerging and persisting health issues in the Region of the Americas. It also looks ahead, analyzing those opportunities brought to light by the COVID-19 experience for strengthening PAHO\u2019s promotion of and contribution to equity and progressive realization of the right to health. Moreover, it indicates how the Bureau, with the concurrence and guidance of Member States, and in collaboration with partners, will take advantage of such opportunities. This report is complemented by the Financial Report of the Director, and the Report of the External Auditor for the year 2020.",

        "text":"During a regional workshop in Argentina, the Director of PAHO called for countries to increase investment in epidemic and pandemic preparedness, because the question is not \u201cif there will be a new pandemic, but when\u201d. Buenos Aires, August 17, 2022 (PAHO)- With the aim of supporting countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to develop or update their operational plans to face future pandemics, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is holding a regional workshop on preparedness and response to events with pandemic and epidemic potential in Buenos Aires this week. This workshop will take into account the lessons learned from COVID-19. \"As we meet today, we continue to deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic and, at the same time, we are facing an outbreak of Monkeypox in several countries,\" said PAHO Director Carissa F. Etienne. COVID-19, she said, \"has been a formidable challenge\" and \"a stark reminder of the responsibility we all have to invest in prevention, preparedness and response to communicable pathogen events\u201d. Dr. Etienne highlighted that, as of last Wednesday, there were 170 million cases and nearly 3 million deaths due to COVID-19 in the Americas. She noted that other respiratory pathogens are re-emerging, and that seasonal influenza causes between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths each year in the region. \"We must never forget that it is not a question of whether a pandemic will occur due to a new influenza virus, but when it will occur,\" she warned. \"Our capacity to respond to health emergencies depends on what we have done before they occur and what we have learned during previous emergencies\" such as COVID-19, said the PAHO Director during the opening of the workshop, which brings together technical experts in epidemiology, laboratory, immunization and risk communication from the ministries of Health of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Suriname. A preparedness and response plan for events with epidemic and pandemic potential is one of the core capacities required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legally binding international convention adopted by Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent and respond to public health threats that can cross borders and affect populations around the world. \"Functioning health systems are the foundation of health security,\" asserted Dr. Etienne and it is essential to \"secure supply chains of vaccines, medicines, laboratory reagents, personal protective equipment and other strategic public health goods\" before the next emergency occurs, and \"strengthen the resilience of health systems with human resources and planning.\" The PAHO Director recalled that two centers in Argentina and Brazil were designated by WHO for the future development and production of vaccines using mRNA technology, something that is expected to improve timely and equitable access to vaccines in the region and contribute to health self-sufficiency. \"All of this is key for us to be prepared to respond and succeed during emergencies that threaten our region,\" she stressed. The Minister of Health of Argentina, Carla Vizzotti, considered that the COVID-19 pandemic showed that health \"must be a priority for everyone\" because \"without health one cannot study, work or produce\". After indicating that the government had to reformulate its response to the pandemic, Vizzotti said that the region must tackle the challenges around access to medical supplies -something learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, and \"think about how we can produce and expand access to vaccines.\u201d Reflecting on the countries' response to the emergency, Vizzotti stated that \"we were able to do many things in a very short time. We have to look back to see what we learned, but also forward in order to make improvements and take action that will better position us for the next pandemic\". \"The COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet,\" said the PAHO Representative in Argentina, Eva Jan\u00e9 Llopis, and added that since the declaration of the public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, \"the response had to be adjusted, to seek funding and involve other sectors\" due to its great scope and duration. \"Reflecting on what we did, taking it to the level of strategies, and thinking about other epidemiological challenges is crucial to continue moving forward,\" she said. PAHO expects to hold similar workshops with other countries in the region during 2022. The outputs of this and other workshops will integrate the vision of the Americas region into global pandemic preparedness and response documents and guidelines.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/opinion\/faustfiles\/100057",
        "text":"In the second part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, and Paul Offit, MD, discuss the ambiguity of long COVID, the risks of pediatric COVID, and the \"human price to pay for knowledge.\" Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Watch part one of this two-part discussion here. The following is a transcript of their remarks: Jeremy Faust, MD: If you're advising my parents, who are in their 70s, should they get their fourth dose right now because they haven't gotten it yet? Or should they wait until the bivalent [vaccine] comes on in the fall because they're trying to avoid infection or anything else? So what should they do? Should they just do it now? Or should they wait? Paul Offit, MD: First of all, it's really hard to avoid infection. It is. I mean, these are highly contagious viruses; they're immune evasive. It's a short incubation-period mucosal respiratory infection, so at some level, we're going to have to try and find a way to accept mild infection. Even for those who are at highest risk, what are we going to do? Boost twice a year? It is just not a practical strategy, I think. In answer to your question, I guess I would wait and see what the data show. Hopefully we'll have much more vigorous data regarding this sort of bivalent vaccine that contains BA5 because it looks like that's the way the [Biden] administration wants to go. We'll have clear data on that, and if that's true, then I would wait because I really do think people make a mistake when they give boosters very close together. You really should wait several months to do that. I disagree with the people who occasionally say, 'Well, get it now and then you can get it again later.' No, let's wait; wait until later to see what this BA5 looks like. Faust: Alright, let's talk about vaccines and long COVID. We know that we know nothing, but there's certainly a concern that this virus, this pandemic, is sort of a mass event for creating disability. Even if there's a range of estimates on how much long COVID there is, and even if the lowest estimates are true, it's still a ton of people. Do you think we're going to get a readout on whether vaccines and boosts in particular help otherwise healthy people avoid long COVID, or is that just going to be impossible to sort out? Offit: Well, you said it, we need to define this phenomenon of long COVID. Right now, you read estimates that range anywhere from 5% of people who suffer natural infection up to 50% of people. For example, the United States has a higher rate of long COVID than Europe does, so we have a definition problem. We clearly need to define it as objectively as possible because it's a real entity, and the part of it that worries me is the vasculitis part. I mean, this is a virus that can cause you to make an immune response to your own endothelial cells that line blood vessels, so therefore all organs are at risk. You do need to have a defined way of doing this because now if you look at these meta-analyses, the symptom that seems to come up to the top most frequently is fatigue, which is hard to define. Fatigue, pain, those are whatever you say they are. It's not like measuring your blood pressure or temperature. It's not so easily defined, so define it! Find a much clearer way of defining it than saying, 'Are you tired when you get up in the morning? Have you been tired for weeks?' because it sets itself up for just including far more people. I feel sorry now for employers and for insurance companies that are now going to try and figure out how to deal with the massive amount of disability that no doubt is going to follow this virus. We need to define it immunologically, virologically, and at some level, psychologically. We have to do that. We have to because it's going to be a big hit associated with this diagnosis. Faust: Long COVID is obviously a concern across the age spectrum, but a lot of young people are worried about it. But there's a group of people that are really maybe relatively low risk, but really of our concern and is an area of great interest in your career, and this is pediatrics; in kids. What's your stance on pediatric vaccines? And how do you respond to the idea that COVID either isn't that bad for kids and they don't need a vaccine, or maybe even if it is on a population level, too many have been exposed anyway so why do it? Where are we on pediatric COVID vaccines? Offit: Right. Well, we all have our biases. I guess mine is that I work at a children's hospital, so I do see children come into our hospital who suffer this disease. If you look sort of just at the data that we were presented at the FDA vaccine advisory committee when we made this decision in mid-June about vaccines for less than 5-year-olds, it is clear that there are at least millions of children who've been infected who are less than 5 years of age. It's also clear that at least children have been hospitalized -- and if you look at the CDC data, thousands and thousands have been hospitalized, and according to CDC data, about 200 have died from this virus. Now, you want to make sure you have good data there. Is it that they're getting hospitalized or dying with this virus or from this virus? We need to make that very clear, and I think that's a little less clear. I can certainly say that we see children who come into our hospital because they have COVID or are treated because they have COVID; some of whom end up in the intensive care unit. It's real, and for that reason it should be prevented. So then the question becomes when is the best time to vaccinate, I think. Because if you make the assumption that the virus can cause death at any age -- which is true -- if you make the assumption that this virus is going to be with us for years, if not decades, which I think is also true, then the question is: When to vaccinate? Because every year in this country 3.5 to more than 4 million children are brought into this world who are fully susceptible to this virus, and this virus is going to be around for a long time. We are going to need to have a high level of population immunity to protect them. So [the question] when to vaccinate, is what I would argue. Now, in the worst case scenario, it may be that if you find that memory responses, which were associated generally with protection against severe disease, fade after 5 years or 10 years and you need to re-vaccinate later, fine. But at least you've protected them during that period of time. Faust: Can I ask you for a clinical impression? I'll set it up by sharing a little bit of mine. In early 2020, COVID pneumonia was on every x-ray. They come in and it's like, 'Wow, this is a crazy x-ray. Why do I keep seeing this thing?' And then in the Delta\/Omicron period, where you had a lot of people coming into the hospital even though they were vaccinated, that group didn't have COVID pneumonia. They were being hospitalized for emphysema, but COVID exacerbated it so it's COVID's fault, but it's not COVID pneumonia. What do you see in kids who are unvaccinated who get hospitalized? Are they having that COVID pneumonia like I was seeing in early 2020, or is it a kid who's dehydrated who just can't go home? Offit: No. I was on service a few weeks ago and we saw an unvaccinated adolescent who came in, who clearly had COVID pneumonia. I mean, he was sick. He required supplemental oxygen; his oxygen saturation levels were low. If you looked at his x-ray and his CT scan, it was striking and clearly COVID pneumonia. Faust: And what do you say to people who were out there saying, 'Look, this is so rare [in kids]. We don't need to make kids have to get vaccinated. They don't have hypoxia.' You know, the downplayers, how do you reach them? What do you say to them? Offit: It's not rare enough. I think if this was like rhinovirus, and it's basically a common cold virus, and it's not the kind of thing that's going to cause you to be hospitalized or go to the ICU or die, fine. But it's not that virus; this virus is much scarier. The scariest aspect to me is this MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory disease in children, which is striking. You have a child, typically between 5 and 13 years of age -- an average 9 years of age -- who comes in and usually has a fairly trivial infection that was picked up serendipitously because they were exposed to a friend or family member. A month later, they come back; they're not shedding virus, they're antigen negative; PCR negative, but they have high fever, they have evidence of pulmonary disease, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease. It is a frightening illness and they will occasionally die. That is a post-infectious inflammatory disease that is caused by a respiratory virus, and I haven't seen anything like that before. That to me is the most compelling reason to get vaccinated, actually, because it's just so different from what you normally see. But, you know, this virus can cause severe illness. Yes, it's relatively rare, but it certainly compares to the other viruses for which we have vaccines. I mean, if you're willing to get a polio vaccine or a flu vaccine or a chickenpox vaccine or measles vaccine, this virus compares to those in terms of how likely it is to kill you. Faust: We're running out of time, but I can't resist, why is it that MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, seems to have gone down in incidents in the Delta and Omicron period? This is a tremendous relief, but why do we think that happened? Offit: It has. I mean, I think it was the data out of South Africa regarding Omicron and subvariants that [said] that MIS-C is definitely less common. You would have to argue that the price that the virus is paying to be more contagious, which is to say the mutations that are associated with immune evasiveness, are also associated with a lesser virulence... Faust: Which favors spread of the virus, actually. Offit: Right, In theory, if you anthropomorphize the virus, it's never to the virus' advantage to kill you. I mean, if it wants to live, and presumably it does, then it's easier to spread from person to person if you're not dead. Faust: Right. At the extremes, the symptomatology has some impact on the reproductive number, but only at the extremes. Other than that, a little bit more virulent, a little bit less; it doesn't matter. I think you are the perfect person to ask this, what I think will be my final question: That is that whenever we are looking at a therapeutic or a vaccine or any intervention in a pandemic environment, you have to balance the need to act with incomplete information in an emergency setting versus waiting until you have enough data that says this is a safe, effective, and even cost-effective approach. How do you balance that? I sense that your balance is a little bit more towards the second one when you sense it is safe to wait, but how do you tell people to make that balance? Because most people are saying, 'Oh, we've got to act. We've got to act, forget it, no time for data.' Offit: Right. Good question. We on the FDA vaccine advisory committee have continued to face that ever since December of 2020, especially for the childhood vaccines; for the vaccine for less than 5-year-olds. Because the question is never 'When do you know everything?,' because you never know everything. The question is, 'When do you know enough?' When do you cross that line where you feel comfortable that you know enough [while] knowing there's always a human price to pay for knowledge. I mean, if you go back to December 2020, there was a death in that placebo group associated with that. I give a lot of credit to these parents who volunteer for these trials knowing their child may be injected with a placebo, knowing that their child may suffer the disease because of that decision. And it's the same for us, because the decision not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different risk. Our goal is to try and figure out how to advise parents or others to take the lesser risk. I'll just add one story because I'm an old person, as you can see since this is a video. I'm a child of the fifties. If you look at the polio vaccine story. So we always hail Jonas Salk, rightfully, as a critical researcher in the development of the polio vaccine. Well, when we did that trial -- when Thomas Francis ran that so-called Francis Field Trial of the polio vaccine between 1954 and 1955 -- you had 1.2 million children who were vaccinated, ultimately. It was about 400,000 children that were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, 200,000 received the placebo shot, and you had another 1.2 million children who were observed on inactivated controls. It was like a 1.8-million child study; a huge study. Jonas Salk didn't want to do that study. He didn't. He felt he'd vaccinated 700 children in the Pittsburgh area, he thought that the immune response was excellent, it was an inactivated vaccine, he could not imagine that anyone should ever do a trial with a placebo. He couldn't conscience that trial. The 1.2 million children who were observed uninoculated were really a nod to him. He did not want to inoculate children with placebo in the mid-1950s, knowing that every year 20,000 to 30,000 children suffered paralysis, and about 1,500 children died of polio. So when Thomas Francis gets up and he makes the announcement that the vaccine was safe, potent, and effective -- three words that appeared on the headline of every newspaper in this country -- how did he know it was effective? He knew it was effective because 16 children died of polio in that study, all in the placebo group. He knew it was effective because there were 36 children who were paralyzed in that study, 34 in the placebo group. Those were first and second graders in the 1950s; I was a first and second grader in the 1950s. Those children could have lived long, productive lives but for the flip of a coin. There is always a human price to pay for knowledge, and that's the hardest part of all of this. Faust: And yet if they don't do that study, or they don't do the study today, how many people will die or have bad outcomes because they say, 'Well, I'm not going to do it just because some fancy doctor said it works'? People will be convinced, ultimately, by a combination of education through their pediatricians or through the press, or even through experience where they say, 'Look, every kid I know who had this bad outcome didn't have a vaccine.' Eventually, the anecdotal evidence kind of piles up in a way that's meaningful. Is that fair? Offit: I mean, you're certainly right. You don't convince people without doing those kinds of studies. And in fact, if you look at these two mRNA vaccines, as big as those studies were that were presented back in December 2020 -- 40,000 for Pfizer and 30,000 for Moderna, those are the size of any typical pediatric or adult vaccine trial -- still, we didn't know about myocarditis or pericarditis as a consequence of that vaccine. You knew that only when millions of children were vaccinated. Maurice Hilleman, who I consider to be the father of modern vaccines in many ways because he did the primary research development on nine of the 14 vaccines that we give children, said it best. He said, 'I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first 3 million doses are out there.\" But that's never going to be done pre-licensure or preapproval. So that's how you learn. Medical innovation invariably comes with a human cost either way, either because you do get the vaccine or because you don't get the vaccine. Faust: Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Your analysis has been almost singular in the public conversation in terms of balancing what I would call an exceedingly pro-vaccine stance while insisting on excellent science so that we eventually reach the most people. So thank you for doing that and for joining us here today. Offit: My pleasure. Thank you. Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan.

        "text":"Early treatment with three repurposed drugs -- metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine -- did not prevent severe outcomes from COVID-19 in high-risk patients, according to a phase III randomized trial. Among over 1,300 patients with overweight or obesity, the adjusted odds ratio for a primary event, including hypoxemia, an emergency department (ED) visit, hospitalization, or death, was 0.84 (95% CI 0.66-1.09, P=0.19) with metformin, 1.05 (95% CI 0.76-1.45, P=0.78) with ivermectin, and 0.94 (95% CI 0.66-1.36, P=0.75) with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, reported Carolyn T. Bramante, MD, MPH, of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine. In prespecified secondary analyses, the adjusted odds ratios for an ED visit\/hospitalization\/death and hospitalization\/death with the three drugs were: 0.58 (95% CI 0.35-0.94) and 0.47 (95% CI 0.20-1.11) with metformin 1.39 (95% CI 0.72-2.69) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.19-2.77) with ivermectin 1.17 (95% CI 0.57-2.40) and 1.11 (95% CI 0.33-3.76) with fluvoxamine While a \"possible benefit for the prevention of the more severe components of the primary endpoint ... was shown for metformin ... this finding was a prespecified secondary endpoint and thus cannot be considered to be definitive pending the results of other trials,\" Bramante and team wrote. In an accompanying editorial, Salim S. Abdool Karim, MB, ChB, PhD, and Nikita Devnarain, PhD, of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York City, noted that doctors are doing more harm than good by using drugs that don't work, asking, \"How much evidence of nonefficacy is enough?\" \"Prescribing nonefficacious treatments is not a neutral or harmless option,\" they wrote, pointing out that not only does this practice keep patients from getting the right treatment, it also can lead to potential side effects and drug shortages for patients who need the drugs for other illnesses. \"Hence, it is important to have reliable evidence of nonefficacy and to have journals publish such studies,\" they continued. \"It is also important that multiple rigorous randomized, controlled trials be performed to provide unequivocal evidence on the efficacy of new treatments.\" \"In keeping with evidence-based medical practice, patients with COVID-19 must be treated with efficacious medications; they deserve nothing less,\" they concluded. For this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which was conducted from Dec. 30, 2020 to Jan. 28, 2022, Bramante and colleagues included 1,323 patients (median age 46, 56% women) from six institutions. Six percent of the women were pregnant, and 52.2% of the overall group were vaccinated. The primary composite endpoint was hypoxemia (\u226493% oxygen saturation on home oximetry), an ED visit, hospitalization, or death. The participants were assigned to the three drugs using a 2-by-3 factorial design: 663 were assigned to metformin and were compared to 660 in the placebo group; 410 were assigned to ivermectin and were compared to 398 placebo patients; and 334 were assigned to fluvoxamine and were compared to 327 in the placebo group. All patients had to be enrolled within 3 days of a confirmed COVID diagnosis and less than 7 days after onset of symptoms. Of the 1,305 patients with complete data, 25.5% experienced a primary event, of whom 19.5% were vaccinated. Bramante and colleagues acknowledged that their findings may not be generalizable to those without overweight or obesity. Disclosures This study was supported by the Parsemus Foundation, Rainwater Charitable Foundation, Fast Grants, and UnitedHealth Group Foundation. The fluvoxamine placebo tablets were donated by Apotex Pharmaceuticals. The ivermectin placebo and active tablets were donated by Edenbridge Pharmaceuticals.

        "title":"Faust Files: Paul Offit on His Vote Against Bivalent COVID Boosters",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/opinion\/faustfiles\/100026",
        "text":"In the first part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, talks with Paul Offit, MD, about his recent decision to vote against the bivalent COVID-19 booster shot at a recent meeting of FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The following is a transcript of their remarks: Jeremy Faust, MD: Hello, I'm Jeremy Faust, medical editor-in-chief of MedPage Today. Thanks for joining us. Today we are joined by Dr. Paul Offit. He is a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, which is the committee that publicly discusses, and debates, and ultimately votes on recommendations related to the COVID-19 vaccines and their authorization for use. Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Paul Offit, MD: My pleasure. Faust: Let's start by talking about an article you wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, 'COVID-19 boosters -- where from here?' You argued, essentially, that these mRNA vaccines in particular were designed to do something very specific, which is to prevent severe disease and deaths, and that they happen to temporarily do what everyone else wants them to do, which is to decrease infections. It seems to me that a lot of people are looking at boosters and they don't realize it, but they're treating them like they're almost prophylaxis, and I think that, in your view, is not a sustainable way to do things. How do you think this is going to play out? Offit: I think probably you can trace the confusion back to December of 2020. In December of 2020, the FDA vaccine advisory committee was asked to consider both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Those were two-dose vaccines given 3 or 4 weeks apart, and protection against mild, moderate, and severe disease was 95%. Those vaccines were roughly 95% effective at preventing not only severe illness, but also mild illness. Then what happened was 6 months later, the CDC did studies showing that protection against severe disease holding up, which is good, but the protection against mild disease was fading -- as you would've guessed -- because protection against mild diseases, for the most part, is mediated by neutralizing antibodies present at the time of infection, and those faded. So why was it 95% protection against mild disease in December of 2020? Those were 3-month studies. Those participants had just gotten their second dose. So therefore, you sort of had this unrealistic sense of what this was all about. That was the way it was handled, not only by the media, but I think in many ways by public health officials; officials who use words like 'fading immunity' or 'breakthrough infections' when you were seeing exactly what you would expect to see. Even 1 year later, when studies were done by Mark Tenforde out of the CDC, with just two doses you found that protection against severe disease was holding up. Then Omicron hit, which was an immune-evasive strain, and caused mild illness even in those who were vaccinated. I think this sort of led to a lot of confusion and ultimately led to a third dose and then to a fourth dose. And I think we used terms like 'fully vaccinated' as compared to 'fully vaccinated and up-to-date,' and I think it would be hard to find 10 Americans who would agree on what it means to be protected against this virus. Faust: I think that's fair. Now, I actually think this next question is sort of out of order, but I think it's important that we do it first. That is that you are, as I mentioned in the introduction, on the committee -- VRBPAC -- that looks at these questions of what we should do next and makes recommendations, and you voted against the bivalent booster. That is, using a booster that's got some of the old strain and some of the Omicron [strain] in it. You voted against that for the fall. I'd like you to talk us through your thought process and why you think that doing it your way would be better. Offit: The studies that were presented to us on June 28 of this year, 2022, by both Pfizer and Moderna were done the right way, which is to say they gave people three doses of the ancestral strain vaccine and then the fourth dose was either the ancestral strain vaccine or the fourth dose was a bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine in both cases, for Pfizer and Moderna, was the ancestral strain plus BA.1, the original Omicron strain. They then looked at the difference in those neutralizing antibody responses based on whether you got the ancestral boost or whether you got the bivalent boost. What they found was -- depending on how the study was done because Pfizer did 30 mcg or 60 mcg and Moderna did 25 mcg for the ancestral and then 25 mcg for the Omicron strain -- they found that the difference in neutralizing antibodies was either 1.5-fold greater against neutralizing antibodies for Omicron if you got the bivalent strains compared to if you just got the ancestral strain, or 1.75 greater, or 1.97 greater. The implication was that that's good enough; that those statistically significant differences were also clinically significant differences, when we knew that back in December of 2020 -- when you looked at the neutralizing antibody differences between Moderna and Pfizer -- there was roughly a twofold greater neutralizing antibody response for Moderna than Pfizer, but that didn't really matter in terms of protection against severe illness. So why were we making this difference of 1.5-fold or 1.97-fold greater with the Omicron boost than the ancestral boost? Why were we making that seem as if that was going to be the answer to all our problems? Plus, the BA.1 strain is essentially gone. It's been replaced by BA.5\/BA.4 and now BA.2.12.1, which are just Omicron subvariants that are somewhat distant from BA.1. So where this is settled out is that I think the [Biden] administration is interested in having a bivalent vaccine where one of the strains is the ancestral strain and the other strain is BA.5. And we'll see, but I certainly hope that before they launch that kind of program for the American public, they show clear evidence that there is a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies with BA.5 associated with that boost. Because remember, even with boosting the ancestral strain, you do get somewhat of a broadening of immune response as Linda Saif and coauthors showed in a New England Journal Medicine paper at the end of June. So I think that's the burden that it should be held to because otherwise it's just marketing, right? Otherwise it's like, 'I'm going to give you BA.5 because BA.5 is circulating and therefore it's going to be better,' which theoretically makes sense, but you need to have clear evidence, preferably clinical data, but at the very least compelling immunological data. Faust: Now, would moving to a bivalent booster just in general be progress against this concern about 'imprinting or antigenic sin'? The idea is that whatever your body sees first, it will sort of narrowly respond to that. Therefore in the future, your body doesn't have as good of a response because of what it initially saw. Does giving bivalent anything actually have some benefit just on those grounds? Offit: Again, it should be proven, but the imprinting thing was originally defined by a researcher named Thomas Francis, who was working with influenza back in the 50s, and he used the term 'original antigenic sin.' The thinking was this, you can tell when children were born based on the way they respond to influenza -- either natural infection or immunization -- because they respond as if they're responding to that original infection. The original infection that they had when they were children, if they then get a vaccine or a secondary infection, they're responding as if they're responding to that first infection and not recognizing the subtle differences with that either vaccine or natural infection. That's what you worry about here, that you sort of lock people into this response against the ancestral strain and don't have the chance then to have a broader response. I will say this though, the ancestral strain is the original strain. It's the Wuhan strain. The one that first raised its head in Wuhan in October\/November 2019 has served us well. I mean, all the way through, even including Omicron and the Omicron subvariants, it does appear to continue to protect against serious illness, which is the goal of this vaccine. At least it was the stated goal of this vaccine, but I feel like we're drifting a little bit from protection against serious illness to trying to protect against all illness. And I would argue that there are some people who can't handle a mild illness. They can't handle it because they have severe heart disease or severe lung disease or because they have out of control diabetes or whatever, so when they get a mild or moderate infection they're more likely to develop a severe illness or because they're immune compromised. So that's different. That's really not fading memory, it's someone who either never had a very good immune response because they're immune compromised or because of their age they don't make very good so-called cytotoxic T-cell responses, so they're not as able to crowd the infection and keep it as a mild or moderate infection. You could argue that that group may benefit from a boost, if you will, to keep neutralizing antibodies high, to the extent they can make neutralizing antibodies for a few months during the times when these viruses are at peak circulation, you could make that argument. But I think we're sort of not making that argument; we're making the argument of boosters for all. And first of all, I think people are a little weary of boosters at this point. Faust: Yeah. I mean, the way I'm looking at it is that people who, as you mentioned, have another risk factor for hospitalization probably need to stay what we'd call 'up-to-date' on their vaccine so that they don't encounter mild illness because mild illness has implications for them that they don't have for others. It's not that they'll get severe disease; severe COVID, it's that that mild illness will make something else severe. That's what we keep seeing, and the data are bearing this out. So, absolutely, I think saying up-to-date for older populations makes sense. I don't think the mRNA vaccines are optimized for this, but they're the best we've got, so that's what we're stuck with for now. But I agree with you that we could kind of spend all of our effort on that group and have huge benefits instead of diffusing the efforts, the money, the signal, for very little in return. As I think about younger people, some younger people obviously really want doses. They've bought into this idea that these vaccines can eliminate infection. I think you and I agree on this, the benefit for boosting for young people is very transient, if any, but over time I think arguments have been made that say, 'OK, look, there's a lot of good reasons to boost younger people.' Where do you stand right now? Do you still think that two doses of the ancestral vaccine is sufficient for most people, and have you softened on third doses for younger people? I guess the third question of this three-part is: who do you think right now needs more than two doses? Offit: I still would argue that for a healthy young person, two doses appears to continue to protect against severe illness. What that third dose does do though for Omicron, meaning BA.1 and the Omicron subvariants, is you do get an increased response against those variants and subvariants. The question is, does it matter? Because still it looks like you're protected against severe illness, so does it really matter to get that third dose? I would argue 'no.' [But] I think that ship has sailed. I think this is now a three-dose vaccine for the most part, because that's the way the press and the public have handled it, it's the way public administrators have handled it. But I still would argue, if you looked at that Mark Tenforde paper that was published in Infectious Diseases, what he did was he looked at two doses for 1 year, up through December of 2021 so the vaccine had been out for a year -- so you're looking through the D614G variant, the Alpha variant, and the Delta variant -- and what he found was that protection against serious illness was holding up. And this was for...80% of the people in that group had at least one comorbidity and a significant percentage were over [age] 65. So that was holding up pretty well. But then Omicron hit, and we clearly have shown that three doses is better than two for Omicron in terms of preventing hospitalization. My question is: who are those people? And I think that's not everybody. I still think it would be helpful for the CDC to sort of sub-stratify that. To some extent they have; they've shown us that at least 75% of those who are getting hospitalized despite having two doses were in these high-risk groups that we just talked about. So focus on them. I think that is what makes the most sense to me. Faust: Yeah. If you look at the CDC's readouts -- I think we've discussed this before offline, but I'm not sure we've discussed it in public -- it's actually very difficult to tell the difference between a person who got their second dose a year ago and a person who got their third dose a year ago. So the idea of the three-dose vaccine kind of only makes sense in that in the period of time for which a third dose increases those neutralizing antibodies. So yes, you could tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose, but you also can't tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose and someone who just got their second dose. What really matters is how far are you out from your most recent dose, and I think that the public is basically not going to keep doing this except for high-risk groups. Is that a fair read? Offit: Very fair. And I think when we compare vaccinated to unvaccinated or got a two-dose versus three-dose you need to also account for who has gotten naturally infected in the meantime, because that does alter things. And it is knowable, I mean, you can know that by looking at say antibodies against, say, the nuclear protein, which is only going to happen if you've been naturally infected. So I think that also is one of the problems -- controlling for natural infection, which now is common. I remember when a couple months into this pandemic, Jon Yewdell, who was the head of virus research at the National Institutes of Health, said 3 years from now you're going to have two choices: be naturally affected or be vaccinated. If you look at some of these recent seroprevalence studies, there was one in JAMA recently, showing that as many as 90% of people have either been naturally infected or vaccinated when they look at the thousands and thousands of lots of people who have donated blood. Now, that's limited by who chooses to donate blood, but I still think it is striking. Faust: Right. And I think maybe a cognitive shift that I made at some point was that you might not necessarily choose between infection or vaccination, but you have to choose infection with protection or infection without protection. In other words, you walk into that infection or that exposure with a vaccine on board or not, and you want to do that, obviously. I want to make sure that we don't make incorrect news here. You said that you think it's a three-dose vaccine, but you said that because you think that basically the scientific debate is over because no one is having it. Not because of science support stuff but basically due to marketing, is that correct? Offit: Yeah. I just got an email today from a mother of a college student who was upset that her child can't go to a certain East Coast school because he hasn't had his third dose. She argues reasonably -- he's a healthy young person, he's gotten two doses, he's a boy who is in an age range where he is at some risk for myocarditis, and I don't think the benefits outweigh the risks here. A perfectly reasonable argument. I agree. I agree with her. Faust: But I also think that, as my friend Carter Mecher pointed out to me when we discussed this like a year ago, that most people who get a third dose, even in that group of a young, healthy male, most people will be happy with their decision to get a third dose because for 99% it makes no difference. For a small, tiny group it would help; for a small, tiny group it would hurt. So most people would just be happy with their decision because whatever they did, they think, 'Well, I got a third dose. I did my best.' Therefore the administration is saying, 'Well, look, if it breaks even we might as well just make everybody happy.' Offit: Yeah. There was an old study that was done at a Canadian racetrack where they asked people to rate their horse while they were on the way up to making the bet, then they asked a different group of people to rate their horse after they'd already made the bet. Obviously, after you already made the bet, you rated it much higher. But what I loved about that article was the title, which was \"Post-decision dissonance at post time.\" Faust: Right. Post-vax something or other -- we could do it with that. The mix and match, the idea of starting with one formulation of Pfizer and then boosting with Moderna, do you think it matters? Certainly, it has a little bit more of an antibody response and more side effects, but on a population level do you think it matters? If someone asks you, 'What should I do?,' what do you tell them? Offit: Wait for data. I mean, it is interesting to see some of these early reports now of boosting with Novavax, which is a purified protein vaccine that's adjuvanted with the same adjuvant that's used in Shingrix, which is an exceptional vaccine. If you've already gotten, say, two doses or three doses of an mRNA vaccine and then you get this dose of Nova, the antibody studies, at least the small ones that have been reported so far, look promising. But again, you ultimately need clinical data, and hopefully the CDC can help generate those data. Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan.

        "title":"CDC Director Acknowledges Poor COVID Response, Launches Agency Overhaul",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/publichealthpolicy\/healthpolicy\/100266",
        "text":"The CDC has done a poor job responding to COVID-19 and will make major changes to its operations, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said Wednesday. \"For 75 years, CDC and public health have been preparing for COVID-19, and in our big moment, our performance did not reliably meet expectations,\" Walensky said in a statement. \"As a long-time admirer of this agency and a champion for public health, I want us all to do better and it starts with CDC leading the way. My goal is a new, public health action-oriented culture at CDC that emphasizes accountability, collaboration, communication, and timeliness. I look forward to working with the incredible people at CDC and our partners to realize the agency's fullest potential to benefit the health and well-being of all Americans.\" \"In April, I launched an effort to refine and modernize CDC structures, systems, and processes around developing and deploying our science and programs,\" Walensky said in an email to colleagues on Wednesday morning. \"The goal was to learn how to pivot our long-standing practices and adapt to pandemics and other public health emergencies, then to apply those lessons across the organization.\" \"The effort included a review of key workflows, with a particular focus on how we swiftly move from science and program to policy, so that we can promptly operationalize guidance for the public,\" she continued. The review Walensky mentioned was conducted by James Macrae, MA, MPP, associate administrator of the Bureau of Primary Health Care at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Walensky and the CDC were criticized for their poor public response to the pandemic, and more recently came under fire for the agency's response to monkeypox. \"For CDC to be more effective, we must build on the lessons learned from COVID-19 to improve how we deliver our science and programs,\" Walensky continued, noting that this includes sharing scientific findings and data faster, as well as \"translating science into practical, easy-to-understand policy.\" To accomplish these goals, \"there are some areas that will require a reorganization,\" she said. These include \"creating a new, agency-wide-focused equity office in the Office of the Director, moving both OLSS [the Office of Laboratory Science and Safety] and OS [the Office of Science] back to the Office of the Director, and establishing a new, senior executive position for global health in the Office of the Director. In addition, I will continue to gather feedback from agency leadership to develop and submit a reorganization package later this year.\" \"We will work together to change systems, processes, governance, and the structure of CDC to build an agency that values and rewards public health action,\" Walensky wrote in the email. \"None of these challenges happened overnight, and our work ahead for improvement will take time.\" \"I am leaning on every one of you to accomplish the hard work of transforming CDC for the better, and I look forward to our collective efforts to position our agency and the public health community for greatest success in the future,\" she concluded. Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director of the American Public Health Association, applauded Walensky's initiative. \"CDC is a great organization, but it has always functioned like a big academic health system and not an emergency response entity,\" he said in a phone interview. \"And the world has changed a lot.\" \"There have been lots of reorganizations at the CDC to improve programming and efficiency,\" he continued. \"But I think what makes this one different is that they're not just trying to move boxes around; they're fundamentally trying to deal with the culture, to deal with issues of more rapidly pulling data together and getting data out in a timely way, so people can make informed programmatic and policy decisions.\" One result Benjamin said he hopes will come out of the review is a single point of entry for outside groups looking to speak to CDC officials. \"All of our associations and groups -- we have to call around to two or three places to find the right person to talk to about something,\" he said. \"A 'no wrong door' approach or single point of entry would be important.\" In general, \"I continue to argue that the federal government needs to think about how it responds to health emergencies and how it utilizes all its assets,\" he added. \"CDC is a major part of the response to health emergencies, but you also have the ASPR [Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response], you have the NSC [National Security Council], you've got HRSA, and you have NIH and the FDA, which have been playing a lot more active roles in these responses.\" \"Because of that, the government needs to think about how it creates a unitary response system, or the command system that clearly defines who's on first and who's on second,\" said Benjamin. \"So if it's an infectious disease emergency, that falls within the CDC and the CDC has command of the response, and if it's some other kind of response, somebody else responds to that.\" Joyce Frieden oversees MedPage Today\u2019s Washington coverage, including stories about Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, healthcare trade associations, and federal agencies.

Thank you for joining us here on Anamnesis, a medical storytelling podcast from MedPage Today. My name is Shannon Firth. I'm a reporter with MedPage and I'll be your host for this episode. For those of you who listen in regularly, this month's episode will be a little different. Instead of three stories from individual clinicians on a theme, we're bringing you just one story. An important story focused on the underreported, sometimes overlooked, challenges for nurses who struggle with substance use. During the pandemic, the public romanticized the role of nurses, casting them as superheroes -- women and men who sacrificed everything for their patients. But for many, the grief, stress, and exhaustion took a toll. In one survey, nearly half of critical care nurses said they felt depressed, and a third said they were drinking more. Six percent said they felt suicidal. And that's where the story of Tiffany Swedeen comes in. Over the holidays, a nurse in recovery from opioid use disorder struggled to keep her addiction in check. She was caring for coronavirus patients on the front lines in an ICU outside Seattle. She asked her hospital for more support, and received little. She reached out to her family, but that just made things worse. On Sunday, January 3, 2021, Tiffany Swedeen relapsed. Tiffany's story highlights the fact that when it comes to substance use disorders, our healthcare system has one standard for patients and another for nurses. And while nurses have responsibilities not only to themselves, but to the public, it's worth remembering that substance use disorder is still a chronic but treatable brain disease, and not a moral failing. This episode of Anamnesis features discussions of drug abuse and suicide that may be disturbing to some listeners. Discretion is advised. Chapter 1.

        "title":"Can COVID-19 Cause Hair Loss?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/special-reports\/features\/100205",
        "text":"Clinicians are seeing an influx of patients who have an unsettling side effect after COVID: losing their hair. Brian Abittan, MD, the director of skin and hair rejuvenation at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, said that he sees multiple patients a week who have reported hair loss after COVID-19. \"A day doesn't go by that I don't get asked about it,\" Abittan told MedPage Today. Although more patients are clearly reporting hair loss after COVID, there aren't robust data describing how many patients experience this phenomenon or what factors put someone at risk. While there are still many unanswered questions about COVID-related hair loss, experts say the good news is that it appears to be temporary and clinicians should reassure patients that their hair will very likely grow back. Some evidence has shown that there is an increased risk of hair loss following COVID infection. A study published in Nature Medicine last month found that hair loss was one of a wide range of symptoms that post-COVID patients reported to their primary care physicians. Patients with a history of COVID were nearly four times as likely to develop hair loss (hazard ratio 3.99) than those who weren't infected, the researchers found. Additionally, a study in the Lancet estimated that 22% of patients who were hospitalized with COVID experienced hair loss after their illness. The most common type of hair loss seen in post-COVID patients is telogen effluvium. \"The assumption is that COVID-related hair loss is very similar to stress-related hair loss,\" Abittan said. Telogen effluvium occurs when the growth cycle of hair is disrupted, induced by traumas such as surgery, illness, or any stressful life event, such as moving or a pregnancy. There are three phases that hair goes through during a growth cycle: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen is the active growth phase, catagen is the transitional phase, and telogen is the resting phase \u2013 in which hair sheds. Telogen effluvium occurs when a larger proportion of hairs on the scalp shift into this resting phase, resulting in shedding at a higher rate. It's normal for patients to lose about 100 hairs a day, Abittan said. But with telogen effluvium, patients could lose up to 300, 500, or even 1,000 hairs each day, he added. \"A lot of times people don't even notice that they shed,\" Abittan said. \"But once they shed to a level where they notice, then they start to count every hair on their head.\" Hair may start shedding as soon as 2 or 3 months after infection, said Alexis Young, MD, a dermatologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. That shedding could last for up to 6 months, and it typically takes about a year and a half for hair to grow back, she added. There are a few hypotheses about why infection may be causing hair loss in COVID patients, one of which being patients' heightened state of inflammation. Certain inflammatory markers, called interleukins, become elevated during COVID, which could be causing a premature shifting of the hairs into the telogen phase, Young said. Because telogen effluvium is triggered by stress on the body, it may be the case that patients who were hospitalized with COVID or placed on a mechanical ventilator experience more shedding than patients with mild cases, she added. \"The more severe cases are probably having more severe hair loss,\" Young said. However, she added that the causes of hair loss in patients with severe COVID could be multifactorial, linked to the medications they took or the procedures they underwent. More research is needed to understand what puts a patient at risk of more severe hair shedding, Young stated. Other theories about what causes COVID-related hair loss include a direct invasion of the virus into the hair follicles, which may interrupt the growth cycle. Given that COVID causes blood clots, some have also raised the hypothesis that tiny microclots may interfere with the growth cycle as well. Abittan said that to determine the best course of treatment, clinicians should evaluate patients to ensure there are no other underlying causes of hair loss, such as a thyroid issue. Once COVID-19 is determined as a likely cause of telogen effluvium, there are some oral pills and topical treatments \u2013 none of which are FDA-approved \u2013 that patients may turn to. However, gentle combing and hair care practices will be most effective in allowing the hair to grow, Abittan said. Because telogen effluvium is not a scarring process, hair can \u2013 and likely will \u2013 grow back on its own, Young added. \"There's not really anything that can speed that along,\" she said. Young advises her patients to eat a healthy diet and try to reduce stress, which could worsen hair loss. \"The majority of people do, ultimately, grow their hair back,\" Abittan said. \"It just takes time.\" There's a broad range of symptoms that patients with long COVID can experience, ranging from heart issues to breathing problems and fatigue. Although hair loss may get lost in the mix with some of these other symptoms, Abittan said resolving the issue is important for patients' mental health and well-being. \"When somebody does experience hair loss, it can be quite dramatic, and concerning to the patient,\" Abittan said. \"It definitely can take a toll on people.\" Amanda D'Ambrosio is a reporter on MedPage Today\u2019s enterprise & investigative team.

        "text":"TTHealthWatch is a weekly podcast from Texas Tech. In it, Elizabeth Tracey, director of electronic media for Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, and Rick Lange, MD, president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, look at the top medical stories of the week. This week's topics include long COVID and variants, treatment of asymptomatic kidney stones, a new blood marker for diabetes and cancer, and managing intracranial atherosclerosis. Program notes: 0:45 Post-COVID syndromes associated with variants 1:45 Systemic inflammatory cluster 2:43 Treatment of asymptomatic kidney stones 3:45 Time to relapse 75% longer with treatment 4:45 New techniques and equipment 5:45 Millions of people with stones 6:05 Two studies in intracranial atherosclerosis 7:05 Also got an additional antiplatelet agent 8:05 Risk of recurrent stroke 9:00 Novel risk marker plasma prostasin 10:01 Significantly associated with both diabetes and cancer 11:30 End Transcript: Elizabeth: Do we have a new blood risk factor for cancer and diabetes? Rick: Associating long COVID symptoms with different variants of the virus. Elizabeth: Should small asymptomatic kidney stones be removed if someone is already been identified with the stones? Rick: And strategies for treating atherosclerosis of the blood vessels to the brain following a stroke. Elizabeth: That's what we're talking about this week on TTHealthWatch, your weekly look at the medical headlines from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso. I'm Elizabeth Tracey, a Baltimore-based medical journalist. Rick: And I'm Rick Lange, president of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, where I'm also dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine. Elizabeth: Rick, how about if we turn straight to, of course in our way, this notion of, \"Hmm, what kind of post-COVID syndromes might you have if you have a different variant of COVID?\" That's in medRxiv. Rick: This was a really interesting study conducted in the United Kingdom in which they tried to do a couple of things. One is they try to see whether there was an association of different long COVID symptoms and relate them to either people who were vaccinated or unvaccinated and the various variants of the COVID virus -- the wild type, the Alpha variant, and the Delta variant -- and they looked at the various symptoms in over 9,300 individuals. They were able to identify three common patterns. There was a central neurologic cluster associated with the Alpha and Delta variants that caused things like brain fog and confusion. There was a second cluster. It's called a cardiorespiratory cluster. It was typically linked to more severe symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, cardiac issues, and lung problems associated primarily with the wild-type variant. Then there was a systemic inflammatory cluster that often had immune-related symptoms. This transpired across all three different variants. These clusters weren't affected by the vaccination status of the individual. It didn't appear to alter the profile or the type of long COVID symptoms associated with these different ones. Elizabeth: There is a paper that we are not discussing this week, but that just came out in The Lancet, that looks at the risk of developing long COVID among quite a large cohort and establishes that as 1 in 8 will end up with these long COVID symptoms. I guess I'm still struggling a little bit with all of this and what its clinical impact might be. Rick: It's not rare. What these authors hope to do by clustering these things is try to find some common etiologies or causes that would help direct prognostication, identification, or treatment. But I think we'll be talking about this more in the future. Elizabeth: Unquestionably, we'll be talking about it more. Let's turn from here to the New England Journal of Medicine. This is a study that addresses this very common condition and that's kidney stones. It looks at whether, when somebody has a symptomatic kidney stone that's being treated if, \"Oops, while you're at it should we take a look at other small stones, those that are smaller than 6 mm, but that are asymptomatic? Should we also attempt to remove those? What does that do in terms of recurrence?\" They did a multicenter randomized controlled trial. However, in that trial they only got 38 patients in their treatment group and 35 patients in their control group. They looked at endoscopic removal of stones in the ureters or contralateral kidney stones. The remaining small asymptomatic stones, again, were removed in 38 of these patients and then they followed up these folks for a mean time period of 4.2 years. They were able to show that the time to relapse was 75% longer in the treatment group than in the control group. The risk of relapse was 82% lower in the treatment group than the control group. They also looked at the financial aspects of this and they determined that it was actually less expensive to go ahead and treat these asymptomatic stones than it was to let this person go on and then get symptomatic later. The editorialist makes the argument that this is, \"Okay and probably a good idea to go ahead and do this,\" although they did note that only one-fourth of the patients in both groups were prescribed preventive medications to try to assist with this recurrence risk. Rick: Elizabeth, as you said, this is an interesting study because if you've had kidney stones and they have been treated there is about a 50% chance that you'll have a relapse within the next 4 to 5 years. As you said, these are individuals who are already going to be treated for kidney stones. It comes on the fact that the treatment has gotten really much better. The urologist have newer techniques and newer equipment. It's overall a very safe procedure. Now, the real question is, \"Okay, what about in individuals that aren't having asymptomatic kidney stones? Should we be doing something for their asymptomatic stones?\" But if a person is having treatment for symptomatic kidney stones, the urologist should at least consider removing the smaller ones that are asymptomatic in the same patient. Elizabeth: Right. I also wonder, though, in this extremely common problem, whether screening would be appropriate in people who have already had an issue. Then finally, the editorialist makes the statement that an alternative to pre-emptive surgical intervention would be to figure out how to make small stones detach and pass spontaneously. Rick: You're right. The options are medications to decrease the formation of new stones or dislodgement of one. Secondly is trying to dislodge them and keep them asymptomatic. That sounds like a pretty noble, but difficult goal. Or the third is to remove them at the time of a procedure. There are millions of individuals that already have symptomatic kidney stones, and removing the additional stones only takes about 25 minutes longer. Elizabeth: What about this idea of screening? What do you think of that? Rick: I would only screen if we are going to do something about it. Do you treat their stones? That's really what a study should address. In that case, if it's proven to be beneficial, then screening should be pursued. Elizabeth: Let's move on to your next one. That's in JAMA and actually there were quite a few of them. Rick: Elizabeth, we're going to talk about two studies together. Both of these are treatment strategies for people that had intracranial atherosclerosis blockage in the blood vessels in the brain that cause stroke. Approximately 12% of white patients with a history of an acute ischemic stroke, or what's called a transient ischemic attack, have some form of intracranial atherosclerosis. If you actually look at people under the age of 55, about one-third of them have intracranial atherosclerosis. At the time of stroke, how do you best treat it to minimize neurologic dysfunction and to reduce the risk that there will be a recurrent stroke? Removing the thrombus or the clot that's causing the stroke is one of the most effective therapies. Can we combine additional therapies to that to make it even more effective? One of which is to use more intensive antiplatelet agents that would potentially reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. In one of the studies they did that. Patients underwent thrombectomy. They removed the clot. They received aspirin and then half received a very potent antiplatelet agent called tirofiban intravenous for 20 hours after the procedure. Unfortunately, what happened was it didn't really improve the neurologic deficit, but it did increase the risk of bleeding inside the brain. The second study looked at, \"OK, what about afterwards, after you have done the thrombectomy either doing a balloon angioplasty or a stent where there was a blockage there?\" They took 358 patients that had a stroke. They did a thrombectomy. They waited for 3 weeks to 12 months afterwards and then randomized them to either put in a stent and a balloon or just continue medical therapy. What they found out was, that was not the case. The addition of stenting or balloon angioplasty didn't reduce that risk at all. In fact, it increased it slightly initially and even over the course of years there was no improvement in survival. Now, that's partly, Elizabeth, because our medical therapy is so good now. They're using intensive statin therapy and aspirin therapy, and we lower their blood pressure. In that setting the risk of recurrent stroke was really pretty low, about 7% over the course of a year, and the overall mortality at 3 years in the medical group was 1.3%. Elizabeth: Yeah, and I wouldn't be me without saying that I think we even need to go further back than that, and let's prevent any of these events to begin with and not have to institute all of this by paying really careful attention to everything -- blood pressure, sodium, and so forth -- so that we can avoid the whole problem for most people. Rick: Elizabeth, we know the risk factors: diabetes, cigarette smoking, and high blood pressure that's not treated. There is a genetic component as well. The average age of these individuals is only 56 years old. You're right, preventing stroke is really much more effective than treating stroke. Elizabeth: Since we are talking about -- you already mentioned a risk factor for that -- diabetes, then let's turn to Diabetologia. This is a look at a novel risk marker for diabetes and cancer mortality. This is called plasma prostasin. I hadn't heard of this before. Had you? Rick: No. It's news to me. Elizabeth: This was a study that was conducted in the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study cardiovascular cohort; that's in Sweden. They had in this particular study 4,600+ participants and they excluded a few of those folks because they didn't have sufficient data for all of them. What they were looking at was this blood marker, prostasin, and blood glucose levels and other covariants. This marker, interestingly, is associated with epithelial sodium channels. There is a relationship there between those sodium channels and ultimately with diabetes and this cancer risk. They followed them up for quite a while -- 22 years more or less. During that time, several of these people developed diabetes and also died from cancer. They were able to show that prostasin was significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes and with cancer, especially strong association in individuals with impaired fasting blood glucose levels at baseline. They are suggesting that this might be a marker that we could start paying attention to. Rick: Studies like this I find are fascinating, but I'm going to talk about the limitations. There was a single measurement of prostasin in these individuals. You want to follow this over a long period of time. For example, we don't even know if prostasin levels fluctuate in the normal population. Whenever you see these, you ask yourself, \"Is there an association at all? Secondly, is it causal or not? Is this a marker or not? Is it a byproduct? Is it related or not?\" These are all things that need to be identified. An interesting hypothesis, but a lot more to be done. Elizabeth: I would finally note, however, that we have talked a lot -- and I have talked a lot it seems like -- about this relationship between diabetes and different kinds of cancers. I think trying to find a smoking gun in here is something that I'm really very interested in. Rick: Yeah, and that's an association many of our listeners may not be aware of. It's clear that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cancer and there is no question about that. Elizabeth: More to come. No doubt. That's a look at this week's medical headlines from Texas Tech. I'm Elizabeth Tracey. Rick: And I'm Rick Lange. Y'all listen up and make healthy choices.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health-news\/11-monkeypox-myths-debunked-by-health-experts",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest False claims and misinformation about monkeypox are continuing to spread at concerning rates. Bill Clark\/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Experts are concerned that misinformation about monkeypox can prevent people from protecting themselves. Monkeypox can affect people of any age, gender, or sexual orientation. It is not just affecting men who have sex with other men. Though monkeypox is not a new virus, the situation is evolving. Still, experts say there are ways to stay safe and informed. Health misinformation has become so rampant and harmful that U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy issued an advisory about it in 2021. \u201cHealth misinformation is a serious threat to public health. It can cause confusion, sow mistrust, harm people\u2019s health, and undermine public health efforts,\u201d Murthy said in the advisory. Now, the U.S. is dealing with a new emergency: Monkeypox. Experts say misinformation about it is circulating quickly, including how it spreads and who can get the virus, and they\u2019re concerned. \u201cIn any outbreak of a new or unfamiliar disease, it is important to get good, high quality information out to people,\u201d says Dr. Linda Yancey, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. \u201cAs we saw in COVID, the rumor mill will kick into high gear, and\u2026people won\u2019t always have the information they need to protect themselves and keep safe.\u201d To help provide accurate information about monkeypox, Healthline spoke with medical experts to debunk 11 troubling myths currently circulating about the virus. Myth: You can get monkeypox from the COVID-19 vaccine Dr. Armand Balboni, an infectious disease expert, says it\u2019s not possible to get COVID-19 or any virus from the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, monkeypox and COVID-19 are unrelated. \u201cThese are two completely different viruses,\u201d he says. Balboni stresses that the COVID-19 vaccines and those currently being used to protect against monkeypox are safe and effective. There are currently four vaccines for COVID-19, and the CDC notes that none contain live viruses. The two most widely distributed, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use messenger RNA technology (mRNA). \u201c[These vaccines] give our cells instructions on how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus,\u201d Curry-Winchell explains. \u201cOnce our cells have made copies of the virus, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine and can combat COVID-19. There is no relation to the monkeypox virus.\u201d Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, which means it uses a modified version of another virus to build protection. The Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine that uses a certain part of a germ to create an immune response. Neither of these vaccines has anything to do with the spread of or protection against monkeypox, either. Myth: You can get monkeypox from a swimming pool Fischer cautions that scientists are still researching monkeypox. But right now, he says it does not appear to be waterborne but rather spread primarily through skin-to-skin contact. It can also spread when people touch unwashed linens and clothing previously used by an individual with monkeypox. With that in mind, Fischer advises people to take precautions at the swimming pool. \u201cIt is important to be aware of what you touch while poolside, as towels and clothing are at a higher risk of spreading the virus,\u201d Fischer says. Though it doesn\u2019t appear you can get monkeypox from the pool itself, Curry-Winchell says it\u2019s possible to get monkeypox from someone in the water if you have skin-to-skin or face-to-face contact. \u201cBe mindful of large gatherings such as pool parties,\u201d Curry-Winchell says. Myth: You can get monkeypox from being in a crowd Capacity limits were a major mitigation strategy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic because that virus is airborne and spreads when someone inhales droplets and particles containing the virus. Officials advised the public that the fewer people there were sharing the same air, the less chance there would be for spread. Though monkeypox can spread through respiratory secretions, the CDC noted in a media advisory that these droplets drop out of the air more quickly. Therefore, Curry-Winchell says it\u2019s unlikely to get monkeypox from being in a crowd. But it\u2019s not impossible. \u201cThere is a small risk,\u201d she says. \u201cMonkeypox is transmitted through prolonged, close contact with an infected individual, so you would need to have skin-to-skin contact with an open sore, such as while hugging or touching objects and fabrics that have been used by someone with monkeypox to contract the disease.\u201d Kissing and sharing utensils and cups, such as during a large wedding, with a person who has monkeypox can also spread the virus. In other words, large crowds themselves aren\u2019t the biggest issue, but rather it\u2019s the skin-to-skin contact people have while in them that is the danger. Myth: Monkeypox is a sexually transmitted infection Though monkeypox can be spread through sex, Balboni says it isn\u2019t the only way someone can be infected. \u201cMonkeypox can be spread from skin-to-skin contact that isn\u2019t sexual or intimate,\u201d Balboni says. \u201cSTIs are most commonly spread by sexual contact. Sex alone is not the only way monkeypox is spread.\u201d Myth: Only gay and bisexual men can get monkeypox If Balboni could debunk one myth, it would be this one. \u201cThe most important thing anyone can know about monkeypox right now is that it can affect anyone, regardless of your sexual orientation or partners,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone should be aware of the risks and educate themselves on how they can protect themselves against the virus.\u201d Yancey says this myth reminds her of the ones that existed during the HIV crisis, which stigmatized the gay community. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to Pres. Joe Biden, recently expressed similar concerns on the NPR podcast, All Things Considered, saying that the \u201cgovernment must fight homophobic stigmas surrounding monkeypox.\u201d \u201cThe virus does not discriminate,\u201d Curry-Winchell concurs. Myth: Anyone can easily get a monkeypox vaccine Two vaccines are available to protect against monkeypox, though neither are monkeypox-specific. ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS were developed for smallpox, but the CDC says they are at least 85 percent effective against monkeypox. Though there are two available, not everyone can get one. \u201cThe vaccine is in limited supply and controlled by the federal government in the U.S.,\u201d Fischer says. \u201cThe CDC recommends vaccination for people who have been exposed or are at risk. According to the CDC, people eligible to receive a vaccination to protect against monkeypox include: individuals exposed to the virus in the last 4 to 14 days. individuals who are working in certain fields or environments, such as healthcare providers and laboratory employees who test to diagnose orthopoxviruses like monkeypox. Myth: The monkeypox vaccine is widely available Experts say the monkeypox vaccine is not currently widely available because of the short supply. Fischer notes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to allocate an additional 786,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine \u2014 an improvement, but not enough. He says the U.S. will need about three times that amount to protect the 1.6 to 1.7 million Americans considered at high risk for contracting monkeypox. Myth: The monkeypox vaccine is new Fischer says neither vaccine being used for monkeypox is new, and both are effective. The JYNNEOS vaccine is the more commonly used and the newer of the two. The FDA approved it in 2019 for people ages 18 and older considered at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox. ACAM2000 was approved in 2007 and replaced Dryvax for smallpox vaccinations in 2008. Myth: Monkeypox was created in a lab This statement is also false, Balboni says. \u201cMonkeypox originated from a colony of monkeys being studied for research in the late 1950s,\u201d he says. \u201cOver the past few decades, there have been sporadic outbreaks of the virus globally, and outbreaks have largely occurred in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa.\u201d Though scientists first discovered the virus in monkeys, Fischer notes the virus may not have originated in the species. \u201cIt remains unknown whether monkeys transmitted the virus to humans as several species can carry it,\u201d Fischer says. But it wasn\u2019t created in a lab.",

        "text":"Harald Walach When a retracted paper is republished in a new journal, should it note the retraction? A few readers have asked us that question as they forwarded a paper published in May in Environmental Research, an Elsevier title. The study, \u201cCarbon dioxide rises beyond acceptable safety levels in children under nose and mouth covering: Results of an experimental measurement study in healthy children,\u201d bore striking similarities to a paper by the same authors that was retracted from JAMA Pediatrics in July 2021. That retraction was the second for the paper\u2019s first author, Harald Walach, who also lost an affiliation with a university in Poland. Walach tells us that he let the editor know about the JAMA Pediatrics retraction before he submitted the manuscript: I think the retraction was politically motivated and did not find any true fault in the paper. I have, of course, notified the editor, before submitting it that it had been retracted and explained in my pre-inquiry why I think that the retraction was void and flawed. Following this the editor invited me to submit the paper in the full version and then submitted it to a new review sending it out to three indepenedent experts, who, of course, knew about its history and found it valid. I changed various details and added some clarifications during the publication process, which is, why the final published paper is considerably longer and contains some more details that had neither been contained in the long version that was published as a preprint nor in the supplemental material, for instance the back to the envelope calculations that show that our measures are well in agreement with those calculated from expected versions, as is done with capnography. This shows: our paper was valid all along, the retraction was flawed and pointless, and the publication which is available now is a valid rendering of our findings. When we asked Jose L. Domingo, one of the editors in chief of Environmental Research, whether the authors had told the journal that the paper had been retracted, he originally said no, and that had the editors known, they probably wouldn\u2019t have sent it out for peer review. But when he checked with an associate editor, he said he\u2019d been mistaken. Domingo told us that the authors had said, in their message accompanying the submission: The paper was originally published by JAMA Pediatrics as a Research Letter. Due to the short format and the fact that a lot of people had not accessed the supplemental methodological information critique was voiced and obviously pressure put on the journal such that the paper was withdrawn, in our view without good reason and without fair hearing. The final \u201cscientific review\u201d the journal said it had received was never sent to us, despite our asking twice. The authors also wrote: Please be aware that the current shape of the paper reflects multiple cycles of improvements already, and the core question is whether experts deem our measurements valid. Naturally we think they are. Everything else, the framing, the political consequences, is negotiable, not our data. We would prefer a swift desk-rejection, if you do not believe that the paper is publishable in your journal. It turns out that the paper had been submitted to Toxicology Reports, another Elsevier journal, before being submitted to Environmental Research. But after what Walach called \u201can unfair review process, a fact that even the second reviewer commented on as inappropriate,\u201d the paper was rejected. Walach said: Although none of the reviews that came back said that the paper was flawed the editors rejected it nevertheless. I assume that it had to do with another paper that was obviously published in that journal and critically discussed at a time, when our paper was submitted and in review. Walach would not say which paper that was, but Retraction Watch readers may recall that Toxicology Reports subjected an entire issue on COVID-19 to an expression of concern in December, and later retracted several papers. We asked Walach whether he thought the republished version should have noted the retraction. Well, this is a matter of editorial policy. If the paper is deemed valid, as it obviously was following the review process, a note that it is a formerly retracted paper that was published by JAMA Ped would only cast a bad light on the journal it was retracted from. Having edited a journal for Karger for more than 20 years I know from my own experience that publishers would normally refrain from such information as one would not want to tarnish another journal. On the other hand, reviewers who want to be sure that they do not look at the same study twice would probably welcome such an information, but they will be clever enough to spot the fact that it is the same study that had been retracted previously. So I don\u2019t see the benefit of it and it would be down to the publisher. Walach also republished his other retracted paper \u2013 which claimed that there were two deaths for every three prevented by COVID-19 vaccinations \u2013 last year. That paper does not mention the earlier retraction either, except obliquely in a footnote to a blog post that discussed it. Walach and the editor of the journal made the reviews and revisions available to us, and we have made them available here. The journal, Science, Public Health Policy & the Law, is published by the Institute of Pure and Applied Knowledge, which as we have noted is \u201ca group that has been critical of vaccines and of the response to COVID-19 and has funded one study that was retracted earlier this year.\u201d Domingo asked us whether editors had a way to check whether manuscripts were new versions of previously retracted papers. Why yes, we told him: Check the Retraction Watch Database, which major publishers and several reference management software programs do. Like Retraction Watch?

        "text":"via CDC We\u2019ve been tracking retractions of papers about COVID-19 as part of our database. Here\u2019s a running list, which will be updated as needed. (For some context on these figures, see this post, our letter in Accountability in Research and the last section of this Nature news article. Also see a note about the terminology regarding preprint servers at the end.) Retracted Expressions of concern Note: Retraction Watch does not draw a distinction between withdrawal and retraction, because journals that have done so have typically done it to justify not saying anything about why a paper was retracted, and to sometimes make a paper disappear without a trace. Richard Sever, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, asked that we include a comment from him about how the processes for withdrawing preprints and retracting journal articles may differ: Journals may retract a paper at the authors\u2019 request and\/or if the editors identify fundamental flaws that would have precluded acceptance if spotted during review. [RW: Note that some journals insist that they cannot make such moves without authors\u2019 permission.] A preprint is usually withdrawn only at an authors\u2019 request. A preprint server will not typically withdraw a flawed preprint against the wishes of the author, since the server made no claim to have peer-reviewed and certified the scientific content in the first place. At the same time, preprint servers *will* withdraw a preprint against the authors\u2019 wishes in instances of fraud, ethics violations, dangerous material, or legal issues. It is thus the nature of preprints that there will be some that contain errors but are not withdrawn and would not appear in the above list. [RW: The same is, of course, true of some papers in peer-reviewed journals.] Like Retraction Watch?

        "link":"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/coronavirus\/equity\/ensuring-equitable-access.html",
        "text":"Published March 4, 2021 Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Emergency Department. Johns Hopkins Medicine is committed to providing equitable care to all, while improving the health and wellness of our patients, personnel and residents in all our neighboring communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has made existing health disparities even more apparent. In light of this concern, Johns Hopkins Medicine will continue to develop new ways to reach all populations \u2014 with specific consideration for vulnerable ones \u2014 to provide access to essential COVID-19 information and services. These include testing, care options, potential therapies, best practices to prevent the spread of illness, emotional support resources, language access options, and much more. With highly effective vaccines now available to us in accordance with government supply distribution, we are focused on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for eligible populations. To help achieve this, Johns Hopkins Medicine has mobilized a multidisciplinary task force specifically focused on vaccine distribution, with equity and inclusion built into its foundation. Through this task force, we continue to reach out to all of our patients, our neighboring communities and our personnel in many ways: MyChart (available in English and Spanish.) is a secure website that provides your up-to-date medical information available to you about your care and your health care team. Efforts to Reach Our Patients As government agencies continue to open vaccine eligibility to certain demographic groups, Johns Hopkins Medicine offers our patients information and access to resources through the MyChart electronic health record system, direct emails, our website, video content, social media, as well as through our health care providers and other referring physicians. Importantly, we ensure that we can reach our patients who may have limited computer or broadband access by providing a dedicated telephone call center that notifies patients of vaccine appointment availability. We also share information through local news and media outlets, as well as by sharing resources through community partner programs. We are committed to ensuring that our patients who want to be vaccinated receive the information they need \u2014 and, ultimately, the vaccine, as our supply allocations allow. Read more about efforts to reach our patients Outreach to Our Neighboring Communities Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center opened a drive-through testing site for COVID-19 patient referrals and other identified priority groups. Johns Hopkins Medicine also has various partnerships and programs in place to reach our neighbors in nearby communities. For example, our Maryland and Washington, D.C., providers continue to collaborate with local governments to help vaccinate specific groups, such as public school employees. In addition, we are going onsite to various senior housing facilities to vaccinate these highly vulnerable residents where they live. We are also working closely with the University of Maryland Medical System to operate the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital, which offers COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy, vaccinations, as well as clinical care. In addition, we have mobilized teams that are going out into the community to provide services, including testing and vaccinations within neighborhoods that have had high numbers of COVID-19 illnesses. In a collaborative effort between the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity, Johns Hopkins Medicine Language Services, and Centro Sol, a new pilot program \u2014 called Juntos \u2014 has helped to provide equitable resources to our Spanish-speaking inpatients with COVID-19. We are also leveraging well-established relationships with community and faith-based organizations to disseminate information about the vaccine. Read more about our outreach to neighboring communities Connecting with Our Personnel Incident Command Center Additionally, our health care systemwide Incident Command Center and our diversity councils are collaborating to reach our personnel across their various roles within the health care system to ensure that they have all the vaccine information and access they need. Just as with our patients, we are leveraging MyChart for vaccine appointment scheduling and notifications. To further enable this, we have established MyChart activation and support stations in our hospitals to ensure that those personnel whose work is not computer-based will receive assistance with securing appointments. We have also established a special telephone line for personnel who lack computer access or who may experience technology challenges with accessing a vaccine appointment. Knowing that different personnel receive information in different ways, we have developed multiple means of communication \u2014 including signs, videos, infographics and a dedicated internal website, among other things \u2014 to help provide critical information to our staff. At Johns Hopkins Medicine, we remain focused on creating effective and meaningful programs to ensure that our personnel, patients and neighboring communities feel they have the information and access they need to COVID-19 resources to remain informed and healthy.

        "link":"https:\/\/contagionlive.com\/view\/sng001-synairgen-s-covid-19-antiviral-for-the-immunocompromised",
        "text":"At more than 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant advances in treatment and prevention options. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is highly effective against severe disease and death, but highly infectious variants like Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are causing breakthrough infections, leading cases to rise once again. To prevent older or otherwise immunocompromised people from severe or fatal infection, Synairgen is developing SNG001, an inhalable COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized persons. Dr. Phillip Monk, the Chief Scientific Officer at Synairgen, joined Contagion to discuss the SNG001 trial data Synairgen presented at the American Thoracic Society 2022 International Conference, held in San Francisco last month. SNG001 is a formulation of Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), a naturally occurring protein that catalyzes the body\u2019s antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses this protein, so the inhalable IFN-\u03b2 directly targets the lungs, the primary site of the COVID-19 viral reservoir. SNG001 may retain some efficacy against the Omicron variant. As a host-directed antiviral, Monk says, SNG001 has \u201cbroad spectrum antiviral potential.\u201d \u201cWe have in the lab actually shown the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 against Omicron as we have against other variants\u201d The phase 3 SPRINTER trial (SG018; NCT04732949) was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study. The trial evaluated inhaled SNG001 to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen. SPRINTER included 624 participants, randomly assigned to either SNG001 (n = 309) or placebo (n = 314) in addition to standard of care. In February 2022, Synairgen announced that SPRINTER did not meet its primary endpoints of hospital discharge and illness recovery. Monk says that this can be partially attributed to the standard-of-care COVID-19 treatments improving so much that SNG001 had to demonstrate a greater significance of disease reduction. \u201cBecause patients are doing so much better, it\u2019s much more difficult to show treatment effect on things like hospital discharge,\u201d Mock explained. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and other antivirals, there are still COVID-19 mortalities. Monk says over 2000 patients are being hospitalized in the US each day, and about 200 people a day are dying of COVID-19. Among the trial participants given SNG001, there was a signal in reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe disease or death within 35 days. Monk said that the greatest treatment benefits were observed in older patients, patients with comorbidities, and especially in people who had poor respiratory function at baseline. \u201cThese are people who are having to breathe faster or have low oxygen saturation despite being on oxygen,\u201d Monk said, noting that this treatment population saw a relative risk reduction of 70% for severe disease.",

        "text":"Novavax announced on Monday afternoon it was seeking an EUA for its COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, to be used as a homologous and heterologous booster in individuals ages 18 years and older. If authorized, it would become the first protein-based COVID-19 booster for adults. \"It's important for people to have a choice as they evaluate how to stay protected against COVID-19, and boosters are an invaluable tool to build upon immunity obtained from previous vaccinations,\" Novavax President and CEO Stanley C. Erck, said in a statement. \"Based on the data presented to the FDA's VRBPAC and the CDC ACIP, we believe our vaccine offers a broad, long-lasting immune response against a range of variants.\" This application for this EUA is supported by data from the company\u2019s phase 3 PREVENT-19 trial conducted in the United States and Mexico, and from the UK-sponsored COV-BOOST phase 2 trial. As part of an open-label booster phase of the PREVENT-19 trial, a single booster dose of the Novavax adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine was administered to healthy adult participants at least 6 months after their primary two-dose vaccination series of the Novavax vaccine. The third dose produced robust antibody responses comparable to or exceeding levels associated with the efficacy data in the primary series phase 3 clinical trials. In the COV-BOOST trial, the vaccine, induced a significant antibody response when used as a heterologous third booster dose. Last month, the FDA granted an EUA for the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine as a two-dose primary series against COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. That EUA was based on findings from the same trial, in which investigators assessed NVX-CoV2373 in approximately 30,000 participants aged \u226518 years old in the US and Mexico. PREVENT-19 data showed a 90.4% vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 83.8 - 94.3; P <.001) versus placebo.",

        "text":"The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA )in the United Kingdom has granted an authorization for the Moderna bivalent booster, mRNA-1273.214, (Spikvax Bivalent Original\/Omicron), for use in immunizing adults 18 years and older. The UK governmental agency becomes the first one to allow for the use of a vaccine designed with neutralizing antibodies for both the original wild strain of COVID-19 as well as the Omicron (BA.1) variant. \"We are delighted with the MHRA's authorization of Spikevax Bivalent Original\/Omicron, our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine. This represents the first authorization of an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine, further highlighting the dedication and leadership of the UK public health authorities in helping to end the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, said in a statement today. The MHRA decision is based off the data of Moderna\u2019s phase 2\/3 trial. The results of that trial were announced about a month ago and demonstrated that the vaccine met all primary endpoints, including superior neutralizing antibody response against Omicron when compared to a 50 \u00b5g booster dose of mRNA-1273 in baseline seronegative participants. A booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 increased neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMT) against Omicron approximately 8-fold above baseline levels. According to the company, 1 month after a 50 \u00b5g booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 was given to people previously vaccinated and boosted, the new dose resulted in significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 compared to Moderna\u2019s authorized booster. And this was regardless of prior infection status or age in adults over 18, greater or less than 65 years old. In addition, when the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 booster was given to people without previous COVID-19 infections, this also resulted in significantly higher neutralizing titers against BA.4\/5 compared to the authorized booster, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.51-1.90). \u201cmRNA-1273.214 has consistently shown superior breadth of immune response over mRNA-1273 in clinical trials. This bivalent vaccine has an important role to play in protecting people in the UK from COVID-19 as we enter the winter months,\" Bancel said in today\u2019s statement. Moderna has completed regulatory submissions for mRNA-1273.214 in Australia, Canada, and the European Union and expects further authorization decisions in the coming weeks.",

        "link":"https:\/\/contagionlive.com\/view\/tuberculosis-outbreak-in-us-traced-to-bone-grafts",
        "text":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that their investigation of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the US in the Summer of 2021 found an \"unprecedented outbreak\" arising from bone allograft product containing live cells, derived from a single, deceased donor. Noah Schwartz, MD, medical epidemiologist, CDC, and colleagues point out that donor-derived tuberculosis after solid organ transplantation has been well characterized, but that transmission of mycobacterium tuberculosis through tissue grafts is rare. Their investigation, however, revealed the largest tissue-derived tuberculosis outbreak ever recorded, affecting 113 persons in 18 states, with at least 3 attributable deaths. \"The outbreak notification and response were swift and effective,\" Schwartz told Contagion. \"The Delaware Division of Public Health notified CDC on May 25, 2021, of 7 patients who were diagnosed with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis disease in April and May 2021 after undergoing spinal surgery. At the state's invitation, a CDC team deployed to Delaware to describe the epidemiology of cases and opportunities for transmission, and to provide prevention and treatment recommendations,\" he recounted. \"On June 2, 2021, another state reported a case of TB disease following spinal surgery, and the manufacturer proactively issued a voluntary, nationwide recall of the single lot of product linked to these patients,\" Schwartz said. Following the recall, 18 unused units were located and sequestered. Seven of the 113 product recipients died before the outbreak was detected, and 1 died the day after being notified of the exposure. Three of the deaths were attributed to tuberculosis after recognition of the outbreak. All 105 living recipients were notified of their tuberculosis exposure by June 15, 2021. Eight had begun treatment before the outbreak detection, and the remaining 96 were started on treatment by June 21, 2021. Current regulations in the US do not require organ or tissue donors to be assessed for tuberculosis or tuberculosis risk factors, or for laboratory testing for M tuberculosis. The manufacturer had processed the bone tissue into a product that included demineralized cortical bone and cancellous bone processed to retain live cells; and samples underwent bioburden testing for bacteria and fungi, but not for M tuberculosis. A change in regulations could follow from the CDC investigation findings, Schwartz suggested. \"Based on this investigation,t he American Association of Tissue Banks has developed new recommendations for preventing tissue transmission of TB,\" he said. In the case of this infected tissue donor, a deceased 80 year old man, there was a history of previous residence in, and frequent travel to a country with an annual tuberculosis incidence of greater than 20 cases per 100,000 population. His risk factors for progression of tuberculosis included end-stage renal disease and type 2 diabetes. He had skin tested negative for tuberculosis, however, at a dialysis center 4 months before his hospital admission. At admission, he had also completed, and answered \"no\" to all questions on a tuberculosis risk assessment questionnaire. The standard donor testing for hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis, and human T-lymphotropic virus was negative. In the hospital, chest radiography revealed patch bilateral airspace opacities with a small pleural effusion, which were presumed to reflect community acquired pneumonia. A history of having lost approximately 35kg body weight over 2 years had been attributed to dietary changes; and his cough and dyspnea were attributed to heart and renal failure. There was no mycobacterial testing in the hospital before he expired in hospice care. Schwartz and colleagues suggest that the negative tuberculin skin test 4 months before the death could have been a false negative from impaired T-lymphocyte function, due to his end-stage renal disease and even the progressed tuberculosis disease. They also note the possibility that the dermal response to the test had been misinterpreted. The report recommends several measures to avoid the recurrence of these events, and Schwartz emphasized the importance of changing procedures and improving safeguards, in his comments to Contagion. \"The most important finding from this study was that standard donor and tissue screening measures did not prevent this outbreak,\" he said. \"All prospective tissue donors should be assessed for risk factors for TB infection and symptoms of TB disease,\" Schwartz declared. \"Laboratory testing of donated tissues, particularly involving products containing live cells, should be strongly considered if TB risk factors or symptoms are present.\"",

        "text":"Given the high transmissibility and potential lethality of SARS-CoV-2, vaccination remains a potent strategy to fight morbidity and mortality\u2013yet the question of how and when to vaccinate children, especially young children, has been hotly debated. To gain an understanding of the mechanisms of childrens\u2019 immune response to COVID-19, an Italian team of scientists conducted a study examining antibody titer levels in children after infection and comparing them with antibody levels in adults. The study was published in July in JAMA Network Open. The subjects were part of family groups enrolled at the COVID-19 Family Cluster Follow-up Clinic in the Department of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health in Padua between April 1, 2020 and August 31, 2021. After excluding people who had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 or who were found to not have COVID-19, the team ended up with 659 individuals (parents and children) representing 252 family clusters, all of whom had at least 1 measure of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG titers taken after infection. Because RBD antibodies are strongly correlated with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), measuring their levels is an effective method of determining the strength of an individual\u2019s COVID-19 immune response. The team analyzed titer samples collected 1 to 4 months, 5 to 9 months, and 10 months or more after COVID-19 infection. Within each of those time frames, subjects were stratified into groups including younger than age 3, 3 to 5, 6 to 11, 12 to 17, and 18 or older. In each of the 3 time frames studied, younger children displayed measurably higher antibody levels than older ones\u2013up to 5-fold higher in the under-3s compared with the 18-and-over subjects. At 1 to 4 months past infection, children younger than 3 had a median S-RBD IgG titer kBAU\/L level of 342.8 (179.5-519.6); those 3 to 5 had a median level of 234.6 (113.5-347.9); 6 to 11 year olds had a median level of 164.1 (79.1-236); 12 to 18 year olds\u2019 median level was 103.1 (46.3-170.2); and those 18 and older had a median level of 64.5 (26.2-140.9). At 10 months out and longer, when antibody levels had declined in all age groups, younger children consistently produced higher median levels than did older ones. The median antibody level for the under-3s was 146.2 (62.8-231.2); the 3 to 5 group median was 115.6 (45.9-160.6); 6 to 11 had a median level of 90.6 (62.4-111.8); the median for ages 12 to 17 was 48.6 (18.1-95.7); and the 18 and over cohort\u2019s median was 36.7 (13.5-108.5). In all age groups, antibody waning was fastest during the first 200 days after infection and slowed afterward. In addition, the youngest children\u2013under age 6\u2013experienced a more precipitous decline of antibody levels than their older cohorts. Nevertheless, detectable antibody levels remained 18 months out from infection in all age groups. The precise reasons behind the varying antibody titer levels among different age groups are unknown, but the study\u2019s authors hypothesize that individual cellular responses, genetic differences, environmental factors, and random variables all contribute. One possibility, they wrote, is that COVID-19 infection in the elderly generates antibodies that take aim at different proteins than antibodies generated by infections in children. While children\u2019s relatively high antibody levels would seem to offer protection against reinfection with COVID-19 for at least a year, the emergence of new variants means there are no guarantees. \u201cAlthough it was observed that antibodies showed strong cross-reactivity to different variants, including Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Mu, for more than 1 year after infection, future studies should also confirm that long-lasting response against Omicron,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cMoreover, to better understand the long-term persistence of immune protection against new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and to translate our data into estimations of immunity of children to subsequent infection, future research should include the evaluation of the longevity of B and T cells, which plays a key role in the human immune response.\u201d The study\u2019s limitations include pandemic-related delays in accessing the clinic, resulting in a variety of follow-up times. Also, the precise date of infection could not be determined in all subjects, as some lacked a positive nasopharyngeal swab result. In these cases, the emergence of symptoms in family members provided a temporal marker.",

        "text":"COVID-19 infection is known to cause adverse outcomes for expecting mothers and their newborns. A recent JAMA study examined whether this association between COVID-19 and severe maternal morbidity was affected by COVID-19 strain. The retrospective cohort study was conducted in a large US health system between March 2020 and January 2022. The investigators defined 4 distinct periods of the pandemic, as characterized by the COVID-19 viral strain that was predominant. The wild-type strain period ran from March-December 2020, Alpha (B.1.1.7) from January-June 2021, Delta (B.1.617.2) from July-November 2021, and Omicron (B.1.1.529) from December 2021-January 2022. The primary study outcome was any event of severe maternal morbidity, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines as occurring during hospitalization for delivery. Secondary outcomes were number of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) events, respiratory SMM, non-respiratory SMM, and non-transfusion SMM events. The average age of the 3129 COVID-19 patients was 29.1 years. They were propensity matched with 12504 non-COVID-19 patients that averaged 29.2 years. Data were analyzed from October 2021-June 2022. The patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher rates of severe maternal morbidity events in all pandemic periods, except for the Omicron period. The risk of any COVID-19-associated SMM increased 2.74% for the wild-type strain, and 2.57% for the Alpha variant, but SMM risk jumped 7.69% higher during the Delta period. These findings were similar across respiratory complications, non-respiratory complications, and non-transfusion outcomes. The investigators found that the risk of severe maternal morbidity was highest during the period when the Delta COVID-19 variant was predominant. These results are not necessarily surprising, as Delta is known to have caused more severe disease than other variants in all populations. The observed differences in maternal morbidity by COVID-19 strain emphasize the importance of utilizing vaccines to prevent COVID-19 in expecting mothers. Additionally, COVID-19 infection should be considered a risk factor for adverse peripartum outcomes.",

Though the live-broadcast meeting did not weigh any regulation decision nor tailor its agenda to any single vaccine candidate or company, it provided the public a glimpse into the mindset of the FDA\u2019s key experts weeks prior to anticipated Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applications for COVID-19 vaccines. The advisory committee meeting also allowed for community-based input\u2014of which there was plenty, as advocacy and health organizations alike represented differing patient populations, issues in disparity, and calls for scrutinous, transparent regulation of any possible vaccines. In this week\u2019s episode of Vaccine Race, Donald Alcendor, PhD, rejoined the limited series to give real-time takeaways from the VRBPAC meeting and what discussion could implicate for COVID-19 vaccine regulation. Among topics, the expert from Maharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine provided perspective on secondary phase 3 assessment endpoints, mandated vaccination groups, pediatric treatment arms, and advocacy representation at the meeting.

        "text":"In the months after COVID-19 infection, some patients may experience post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly referred to as \u201clong COVID.\u201d The continuation of COVID-19 symptoms inevitably leads patients to continue seeking health care after acute infection. The impact of post-COVID conditions (PCC) on health care uptake has not been extensively described. A recent study, published in JAMA, examined whether COVID-19 infection is associated with health care utilization 6 months after acute illness. The investigators sought to estimate the excess COVID-19-related health care usage, as well as the most troublesome long COVID symptoms pushing patients to seek medical help. The matched, retrospective, cohort study included patients from 8 large integrated health systems from across the United States. Patients of all ages completed a COVID-19 diagnostic test between March 1-November 1, 2020. The final study included 127859 patients with a positive COVID-19 test; they were matched by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and date of COVID-19 test to 127859 patients who tested negative for COVID-19. Data were analyzed from March 18, 2021-June 8, 2022. The average age of the cohort was 41.2 years, 53.7% were female, 51.8% were Hispanic, 7.1% were non-Hispanic Asian, 6.2% were non-Hispanic Black, and 26.9% were non-Hispanic White. Using Poisson regression models and difference-in-difference analysis, the investigators calculated ratios of rate ratios (RRRs) for COVID-19-associated health care utilization. Overall RRRs were estimated, and estimates were then broken down by health care setting, select population characteristics, and by 44 post-COVID conditions. Excess COVID-19-associated health care utilization was estimated by health care setting. The investigators found that health care utilization was higher in the patients who had contracted COVID-19 6 months prior. Overall, COVID-19 infection was associated with a 4% increase in health care utilization over 6 months. Health care visits were predominantly virtual. COVID-19\u2013associated utilization for 18 post-COVID conditions remained elevated even 6 months after acute illness, with the largest increase observed for infectious disease sequelae (86%), COVID-19 (19.47%), alopecia (2.52%), bronchitis (1.85%), pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (1.74%), and dyspnea (1.73%). COVID-19-associated excess health care utilization accounted for an estimated 27217 additional medical encounters over 6 months. The study authors concluded their findings suggest health systems should plan for long-term strategic resource allocation to adequately respond to the elevated health care needs of long COVID patients.",

        "text":"The Omicron COVID-19 variant continues to mutate, with its subvariants accounting for the majority of new infections. This week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that new COVID-19 cases in the US were 87.1% BA.5, 6.6% BA.4, and 4.8% BA 4.6. One study, published in Nature Communications, examined whether contracting a previous strain of Omicron provides sufficient protection against its new subvariants. The investigators also analyzed the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination at neutralizing the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. In March 2022, BA.4 and BA.5 were detected by genomic surveillance in South Africa, and subsequently led to a wave in infections. Excess all-cause mortality, previously correlated with BA.2, did not sharply increase with the emergence of BA.4 and BA.5. The Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages do not differ from each other in their spike sequence, but have changes relative to the BA.1 and BA.2 strains, including L452R and F486V mutations and R493Q reversion in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). The investigators isolated live BA.4 and BA.5 viruses to determine whether they could be neutralized by BA.1 infection. They considered prior BA.1 infection in conjunction with COVID-19 vaccination, prior BA.1 infection alone, and COVID-19 vaccination with no infection history. To quantify neutralization, the investigators reported 50% focus reduction neutralization test value, the inverse of the plasma dilution required for a 50% reduction in the number of infection foci relative to the no antibody control in a live virus neutralization assay. They found that in individuals with prior BA.1 infection and no vaccination history, neutralization decreased 7.6-fold for BA.4 and 7.5-fold for BA.5. For individuals who were fully vaccinated and had contracted BA.1, neutralization capabilities dropped 3.2-fold for BA.4, and 2.6-fold for BA.5. Their fold-drop versus ancestral virus neutralization was 4.0-fold for BA.1, 12.9-fold for BA.4, and 10.3-fold for BA.5. Finally, vaccinated individuals with no prior infection saw BA.4 and BA.5 escape neutralization at rates similar to BA.1. Fold-drop relative to the ancestral COVID-19 virus was 19.8-fold for BA.1, 19.6-fold for BA.4, and 20.9-fold for BA.5. From these results, the investigators determined BA.4 and BA.5 significantly evaded the immunity generated by a prior BA.1 infection, even in conjunction with COVID-19 vaccination. BA.4 and BA.5 were especially adept at avoiding neutralization in BA.1-infected, unvaccinated individuals. The study highlights the necessity of addition booster vaccination, potentially with the impending variant-specific booster shots expected this fall.",

        "text":"Welcome back to Contagion\u2019s new podcast, Contagion Community, where we delve into some of the social factors that create and widen healthcare disparities. This Pride month, Contagion Community is highlighting the healthcare needs and disparities unique to the LQBTQ+ community. Joining us for June\u2019s podcast are Steven Wolfe, DO, MPH, and Stuart A Fisk, CRNP, of the Allegheny Health Network (AHN). Fisk and Wolfe work with LGBTQ people who are living with HIV. In this episode, they delve into the intersectionality of the disease, emphasizing that HIV prevention and treatment is especially needed for transgender people of color. Wolfe and Fisk both identify as gay men, and thus have a personal as well as professional stake in ensuring LGBTQ+ people have access to comprehensive healthcare. \u201cWe need more physicians, like myself, out there who really understand what the community\u2019s needs are,\u201d Wolfe said. Asked about the current state of the HIV epidemic, Wolfe said, \u201c62% of people who are trans and Black have HIV\u2026I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but I think that we need a lot more work when we\u2019re thinking about the minority populations.\u201d Fisk added that 25-30% of people newly diagnosed with HIV are being diagnosed at the end stages of the disease. \u201cWe do not test people routinely for HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have the biomedical ability to end a pandemic as tragic as this one, and not do it because we\u2019re failing to give people a $2 test, is really a bad thing.\u201d Besides testing, Wolfe said pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another HIV preventative measure that is vastly underutilized. Wolfe cited study data suggesting 96% of transgender women were aware of PrEP, \u201cbut the reality of it is only 32% of transgender women were actually using PrEP to prevent HIV. That\u2019s a huge gap.\u201d Fisk pointed out that similar disparities exist for injection drug users, who are at high risk of getting HIV but are \u201crarely if ever\u201d offered PrEP. \u201cPeople of color in general who have risk of HIV acquisition are typically not being offered PrEP or do not take PrEP.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that HIV carries the stigma of the populations that it most impacts,\u201d Fisk said, noting that our society\u2019s criminalization of queerness, homelessness, and injection drug usage exacerbates HIV disease disparities. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d Fisk has been working with marginalized people since the beginning of his nursing career, which he says has helped him become a better healthcare provider and a better human. Wolfe noted that caring for people living with HIV is often not only about providing healthcare, but also mitigating the stigma these patients may have experienced throughout their lives. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic.

        "link":"https:\/\/contagionlive.com\/view\/a-novel-device-with-covid-19-treatment-potential",
        "text":"Medicine is always looking for novel ways to treat diseases and conditions, whether it be through agents, devices or some other unique modality. And this certainly applies to COVID-19. Aethlon Medical has developed its Hemopurifier, which is a therapeutic device designed for the single use depletion of circulating viruses and exosomes from the blood. The San Diego, Calif.,-based medical technology company has been focusing on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. Specifically, when it comes to COVID-19, the company performed an in vitro study with its Hemopurifier, that was published in bioRxiv. In their study, known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were passed 3 times over columns containing 1 gram of Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin. The percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. Extrapolation of these data would indicate that the binding capacity of the Hemopurifier for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection would be more than sufficient. The Hemopurifier holds a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough device designation related to life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. In June 2020, the FDA approved an amendment to Aethlon's existing open IDE for the Hemopurifier in life threatening viral infections, to allow for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. This will allow for up to 40 of these patients to be treated under a new Early Feasibility Study protocol at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States. Contagion recently spoke to Aethlon CEO Charles Fisher, Jr., MD, and Aethlon CMO Steven LaRosa, MD, who were the study\u2019s lead author and coauthor respectively. They provided an overview of the company, how the device works, and the study\u2019s findings.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD015021\/HAEMATOL_immunity-vulnerable-groups-after-covid-19-vaccination",
        "text":"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which studies on the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines in vulnerable subgroups have been published, and which outcomes were reported (e.g. effectiveness outcomes, safety, or immune response), to decide on the most relevant questions and answer these in further effectiveness systematic reviews (syntheses of the medical literature). What did we do? We searched medical databases and trial registries for studies on COVID-19 vaccines that were authorised for use in the European Union (European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved) and those approved in at least 10 countries worldwide at the time of our search. We included studies on additional conditions (comorbidities) that can reduce the immune reaction to vaccination, if they had more than 100 participants; they could include any age, sex, ethnicity, or country of recruitment. We excluded studies looking at the general population and other than preselected COVID-19 vaccines and subgroups. Once we found the studies, we categorised the vaccines into the following groups: EMA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, other COVID-19 vaccines, and schemes with different COVID-19 vaccines. We summarised the results in an interactive online map. We mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study design, and the vulnerable population. What did we find? We included 318 studies. Most studies came from high-income countries and included adults. We found that haematological malignancies (cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes) and solid tumours were examined in many studies, followed by people receiving dialysis and kidney transplants, rheumatic diseases, and others. Thirty-one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The majority of studies explored mRNA vaccines (N = 283 and N = 153 for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) at two doses, and EMA-approved vaccines were more commonly administered than other vaccines and schemes with different COVID-19 vaccines. Outcomes related to immunogenicity (how well a vaccine works, or the ability to stimulate the development of antibodies), especially the presence or absence of antibodies in the blood of patients or an estimate for the amount of these antibodies, were the most frequently reported outcome in more than 170 studies each. In addition, adverse events were assessed often (N = 126 studies), whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in only 80 studies. What are the limitations of the evidence? Due to the quick development of the pandemic, the research landscape may have changed. The newer Omicron variant has become the dominant variant, and a new vaccine has been approved by the EMA, which is not covered by our search. How up-to-date is this evidence? The evidence is up-to-date to December 2021. What are the next steps? Based on the overview from this review, we have decided to conduct two detailed systematic reviews on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients.",

        "text":"Key messages \u2022 The antibiotic azithromycin is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. \u2022 We don\u2019t know whether antibiotics other than azithromycin are effective treatments for COVID-19 because there is not enough research. \u2022 We found 19 ongoing studies that are investigating antibiotics for COVID-19. We will update this review if their results change our conclusions. What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are cheap and common medicines used to treat bacterial infections. However, recent laboratory studies found that some antibiotics slowed the reproduction of some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In laboratory tests, one antibiotic, azithromycin, reduced viral activity and inflammation, and so it has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We need good evidence before giving antibiotics for COVID-19 because overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, where organisms that cause infection change, so that antibiotics stop working. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease. We evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on: \u2022 people dying; \u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse; \u2022 unwanted effects; \u2022 heart rhythm problems; \u2022 quality of life. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only. Seven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment. We found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published. Main results Inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 Azithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people). Compared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not: \u2022 worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or \u2022 improve patients\u2019 condition (3 studies, 8172 people); \u2022 increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people). Azithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people). No studies looked at quality of life. Outpatients with mild COVID-19 Compared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to: \u2022 people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people); \u2022 whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or \u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people). We don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants). No studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021.",

        "title":"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID-19?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD013705\/INFECTN_how-accurate-are-rapid-antigen-tests-diagnosing-covid-19",
        "text":"Key messages \u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID-19. \u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. What are rapid point-of-care antigen tests for COVID-19? Rapid point-of-care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection in people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. They: \u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point-of-care) or in non-healthcare settings such as in the home; \u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests; \u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and \u2022 provide results \u2018while you wait\u2019. For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \u2018lateral flow tests\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests. Why is this question important? People with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID-19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point-of-care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. What did we do? We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. What did we find? We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. Main results In people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). In people who did not have COVID-19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \u2018acceptable\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID-19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID-19: \u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result). \u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result). In people with no symptoms of COVID-19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID-19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID-19: \u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result). \u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result). What are the limitations of the evidence? In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT-PCR result as evidence of no COVID-19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. What does this mean? In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT-PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT-PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT-PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self-isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people - individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID-19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non-healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.

        "text":"Background Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID-19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. What was our aim? We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated. Methods We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants. Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. Results We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used. A majority of studies were conducted in English-speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at-risk patients, or the general population. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2p9jmx24). Conclusion We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID-19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower-middle-income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake.",

        "text":"Is ivermectin effective for COVID-19? Key messages We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available. What is ivermectin? Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects. Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID-19 is uncertain. We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on: \u2013 people dying; \u2013 whether people's COVID-19 got better or worse; \u2013 quality of life; \u2013 serious and non-serious unwanted effects; \u2013 viral clearance. For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. What did we find? We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment. No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. Main results Treating people in hospital with COVID-19 We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: \u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); \u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people); \u2013 increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: \u2013 improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people); \u2013 non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants). Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. Treating outpatients with COVID-19 Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: \u2013 worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people); \u2013 serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); \u2013 non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); \u2013 improving people's COVID\u201019 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people); \u2013 number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. How up to date is this evidence? The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.",

        "text":"August 15, 2022 expert reaction to MHRA approving Moderna\u2019s bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Moderna\u2019s bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine has today been approved for adult booster doses by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Professor Deborah Dunn-Walters, Chair of the British Society for Immunology COVID-19 and Immunology Taskforce and Professor of Immunology at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines have had a huge positive impact on our ability to manage the pandemic and return to normal life. However, as we\u2019ve seen, new strains of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge which means it\u2019s important that we continue to develop the COVID-19 vaccines to optimise protection against new strains. \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s news that the MHRA has approved the updated version of the Moderna bivalent booster COVID-19 vaccine, which targets both the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Omicron strain, which is the leading strain currently circulating in our communities. The MHRA will have carefully analysed the data to ensure this update to the Moderna vaccine is both safe and effective. \u201cThe original strain and the Omicron strain are quite different from each other. By keeping both in the new vaccine it is hoped to provide immunity against any future new strains related to the original as well as protecting against any new strains related to Omicron. \u201cIt is important to know that although the new bivalent vaccine booster may provide a slightly increased level of protection against current known virus strains compared with the original, this difference is small compared with the overall benefit from any type of booster. It is expected that circulating virus levels will rise in winter so it is important to take up the offer of a booster if you are offered it.\u201d Prof Penny Ward, Independent Pharmaceutical Physician, and Visiting Professor in Pharmaceutical Medicine at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cGood news from the MHRA today as they have announced approval of the first bivalent covid vaccine, Spikevax Bivalent\/Omicron, which provides a mix of the original covid strain mixed with the omicron B.1.1.529 variant \u2013 this is the original omicron strain which hit the UK in January this year. We are now onto the fifth version of the omicron variant family and this temporary authorisation under regulation 174 (the same regulation used to approve the original covid vaccines in the UK) allows use of this bivalent vaccine as a booster shot in adults aged 18 and over. The approval is based on the superior increase in antibody observed following use of the bivalent vaccine, particularly against the various omicron strains including the BA.4 and .5 variants responsible for the most recent waves of illness, in a previously vaccinated population. This approach \u2013 known as immunobridging \u2013 makes use of the relationship between the immune response and clinical efficacy established in the phase III clinical trials of the original vaccine which was >90% effective in preventing covid in the (then previously unvaccinated) population. As a booster shot of this bivalent vaccine achieved a significant increase in immune response covering not only the initial strain but also covering various omicron variants, it is expected that this vaccine will reduce covid illness caused by newer variants. Now we need to await the JCVIs view on whether the bivalent vaccine should be used for all those for whom the autumn booster has been recommended, or if supply constraints will result in targeting this vaccine form to a subset of that population. In the meantime bivalent boosters of all vaccines are in development with the Pfizer BioNTech version under rolling review by the EMA currently, and immunobridging trials well underway. Well done MHRA for approving and Moderna for being first past the post in achieving the first approval of the world\u2019s first bivalent covid vaccine.\u201d Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said: \u201cThe early data certainly suggests that the new Moderna vaccine, targeting two different flavours of Sars2 coronavirus spike protein works better against the newly emerged Omicron variants. These variants have been the most able to escape the antibodies raised through infection or vaccination by previous variants. This should provide people with better protection against the Omicron variants. \u201cHowever, the virus is unlikely to stand still and Omicron-targeted immunity, might push the virus down other evolutionary paths, in which case we will be like the Red Queen in Alice and the Looking Glass \u2013 having to keep running just to stay in the same place. That said, unless there is a major shift in the virus, immunity will continue to protect the vast majority from serious disease caused by emerging variants, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get vaccinated or boosted, especially if you are vulnerable.\u201d Prof Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cThis vaccine contains two components; the first is the original Moderna Covid vaccine for which there is both very large clinical trial data and massive experience following its introduction in many countries including the UK. The second is a modification of that original vaccine targeted at the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 which is a new component. The similarity of that new component to the original has allowed the MHRA to authorise the vaccine based on its antibody response rather than demonstrating it prevents infections. We now know from many studies that this antibody response (neutralising antibodies) is to a degree predictive of the clinical effect in prevention of infection and hence admission to hospital or death. It would take very much larger trials to show such effects conclusively, but we can be confident it is likely to show better clinical efficacy against the Omicron variants than the original vaccine alone. It would be good to have more data available publicly, but the MHRA will have been very carefully checking the submission made to them and the background knowledge on the original provides confidence that this vaccine will be a useful addition. While not quite the same as one of the seasonal flu vaccines which are authorised based on biochemical analyses rather than clinical efficacy, it is a similar process for authorisation. \u201cWhether this will be used in the UK booster programme will depend on other factors, including cost and what estimates of clinical efficacy are derived from analysis of the antibody response.\u201d First bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine approved by UK medicines regulator https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-vaccine-approved-by-uk-medicines-regulator All our previous output on this subject can be seen at this weblink: www.sciencemediacentre.org\/tag\/covid-19 Declared interests Professor Deborah Dunn-Walters: \u201cNo conflict of interests to declare.\u201d Prof Penny Ward: \u201cI am semi-retired, but I am owner\/Director of PWG Consulting (Biopharma) Ltd a consulting firm advising companies on drug and device development.

        "text":"August 15, 2022 expert reaction to JCVI advice on COVID-19 vaccines for the autumn booster programme The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has published its advice on which COVID-19 vaccines should be used in this year\u2019s autumn booster programme. Prof Deborah Dunn-Walters, Chair of the British Society for Immunology COVID-19 Taskforce and Professor of Immunology at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cOver the last year, researchers have been working hard to assess how we can best protect people from COVID-19 going forwards through the use of COVID-19 booster vaccines. The results from these multiple studies have been provided to the JCVI for careful analysis to decide which vaccines should be given as a booster, when this should happen and which people should receive one. \u201cBooster vaccines do as their name suggests \u2013 they provide a boost to your immune system to increase the levels of antibodies and T cells that you have to protect you against falling seriously ill with COVID-19. Previous research shows that individuals who are older or who have a weakened immune system are particularly at risk of becoming very ill if they contract COVID-19, but that vaccination does provide significant protection to them. Therefore, it is good to see these individuals, and the people they come into regular contact with, prioritised in this booster programme. \u201cIn line with previous years, we expect to see levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2 increase during the winter months. Vaccination is still the safest and most effective way to protect yourself from becoming very ill with COVID-19. Once available, it is important to take up the offer of a COVID-19 booster vaccine if you are offered it.\u201d Prof Beate Kampmann, Professor of Paediatric Infection & Immunity and Director of the Vaccine Centre, LSHTM, said: \u201cAvailability of a bi-valent vaccine is good news but how much of a difference it would actually make remains to be seen. The currently discussed bi-valent vaccines were developed with Omicron variant BA.1 antigens in mind, and will only deliver very partial protection against BA.4 and 5. How much difference such bi-valent vaccine can actually make remains to be seen and the bi-valent vaccines have not yet been widely tested in large heterogeneous population groups. In essence, I think it is wise not to recommend a \u201cpersonalized vaccination approach\u201d but to go with the wider entirely pragmatic public health message that boosters are an important intervention for the winter period and should be taken up across age groups, as recommended, with the most vulnerable to be first in line.\u201d https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/jcvi-publishes-advice-on-covid-19-vaccines-for-autumn-booster-programme All our previous output on this subject can be seen at this weblink: www.sciencemediacentre.org\/tag\/covid-19 Declared interests Prof Deborah Dunn-Walters: \u201cNo conflict of interests to declare.\u201d Prof Beate Kampmann: \u201cNo declarations of interest.\u201d",

        "text":"Cedars-Sinai researchers find 56% were unaware they were infected with virus that causes COVID-19 The majority of people who were likely infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, didn\u2019t know they had the virus, according to a new study from Cedars-Sinai investigators. The findings are published in JAMA Network Open. \u201cMore than one in every two people who were infected with Omicron didn\u2019t know they had it,\u201d said Susan Cheng, MD, MPH, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai and corresponding author of the study. \u201cAwareness will be key for allowing us to move beyond this pandemic.\u201d Prior studies have estimated that at least 25% and possibly as many as 80% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may not experience symptoms. Compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Omicron variant is associated with generally less severe symptoms that may include fatigue, cough, headache, sore throat or a runny nose. \u201cOur study findings add to evidence that undiagnosed infections can increase transmission of the virus,\u201d said Sandy Y. Joung, MHDS, an investigator at Cedars-Sinai and first author of the study. \u201cA low level of infection awareness has likely contributed to the fast spread of Omicron.\u201d As part of research into the effects of COVID-19 and the impact of vaccines, the investigators began collecting blood samples from healthcare workers more than two years ago. In the fall of 2021, just before the start of the omicron variant surge, the investigators were able to expand enrollment to include patients, thanks to study infrastructure and biospecimen processing support provided by Sapient Bioanalytics. Of the healthcare workers and patients who have participated in the research, investigators identified 2,479 people who had contributed blood samples just prior to or after the start of the Omicron surge. The investigators identified 210 people who likely were infected with the Omicron variant based on newly positive levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in their blood. Next, the investigators invited study participants to provide health status updates through surveys and interviews. Only 44% of study participants with newly positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had awareness of being infected with the virus. The majority (56%) were unaware of any recent COVID-19 infection. Of the study participants who were unaware, only 10% reported having any recent symptoms that they attributed to a common cold or other type of infection. More studies involving larger numbers of people from diverse ethnicities and communities are needed to learn what specific factors are associated with a lack of infection awareness, according to the investigators. \u201cWe hope people will read these findings and think, \u2018I was just at a gathering where someone tested positive,\u2019 or, \u2018I just started to feel a little under the weather. Maybe I should get a quick test.\u2019 The better we understand our own risks, the better we will be at protecting the health of the public as well as ourselves,\u201d said Cheng, the Erika J. Glazer Chair in Women's Cardiovascular Health and Population Science at Cedars-Sinai. Cheng and colleagues are also studying patterns and predictors of reinfections and their potential to offer long-lasting immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In addition to raising awareness, this information could help people manage their individual risk. Other Cedars-Sinai investigators who worked on this study include Joseph E. Ebinger, MD; Nancy Sun, MPS; Yunxian Liu, PhD; Min Wu, MPH, and Kimia Sobhani, PhD. Learn more about this ongoing COVID-19 study here. Funding: The study was funded by the Erika J.

        "text":"A prolonged drought and unusually high temperatures are affecting large parts of China, limiting drinking water supplies and reducing crop yields. The situation, likely to continue for weeks, has forced the government to shut down factories and impose rolling blackouts as reservoirs to generate hydropower are running extremely low. Image credit: PxHere. For over two months, most of southern China has been dealing with heatwave and drought, with water levels in the Yangtze river, the country\u2019s largest one, and in the biggest freshwater lakes at record lows. China\u2019s meteorological administration has said the drought will continue across the summer and has also warned of flash flooding \u2014 something that\u2019s more likely to happen after a drought (here\u2019s why). The Yangtze\u2019s middle and lower sections have had temperatures over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) over the past month, likely caused by variations in the western Pacific subtropical high \u2013 a major determinant of summer weather in east Asia. It\u2019s been the longest sustained period of extreme temperatures since records began back in 1961. ADVERTISEMENT Six provinces and cities in southern China, including Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, and Sichuan, have been affected by the drought, with 830,000 people having difficulty accessing drinking water and nearly 645,000 hectares of crops damaged, according to the Water Ministry. The lack of rain has been especially marked in the megacity of Chongqing, which covers a large area of mountains and rivers.

China\u2019s southwestern province of Sichuan said it would ration power supplies to homes, offices, and shopping malls, after having already asked metal factories and fertilizer producers to limit their operations. Government offices were asked to set ACs no lower than 26 Celsius and use more staircases instead of lifts, local media reported. With 94 million inhabitants, water levels at the hydropower reservoirs in Sichuan are down by as much as half this month, according to government data. The power company in Dazhou, a city in Sichuan, imposed 2 1\/2-hour power cuts this week, which were later expanded to three hours, Shanghai media outlets reported. ADVERTISEMENT Chinese vice premier Han Zheng visited the State Grid Corporation and said further efforts would be needed to ensure power supply for residents and key industries and to prevent power cuts. China should improve power management, promote the joint operation of coal and renewable plants and accelerate new energy works, he added. China has allocated $44.3 million of relief funds to support agriculture in the regions affected by drought and flood. The funds will be used to subsidize seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides and to repair post-disaster farms. The Minister of Agriculture Tang Renijan said technicians would be sent across the country to assist in crop management. The extreme weather events seen in China are one of the visible consequences of the climate crisis. The world\u2019s average temperature has already increased 1.1 degrees Celsius and is expected to keep rising unless we bring down greenhouse gas emissions dramatically. If our emissions were to drop, we would avoid even worse extreme weather events in the future.",

        "text":"People taking immunosuppressive DMARDs or glucocorticoids are at substantially higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than the general population. However, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remain effective within this group, and it is important that patients taking these medications remain up to date with vaccinations to mitigate their risk. 209 492 people were identified in Michigan Medicine, including 165 913 who were vaccinated and 43 579 who were unvaccinated. 41 078 people were excluded because they were younger than 18 years, partially vaccinated, had received a vaccine other than the two vaccines studied, or had incomplete covariate data. 168 414 people were included in the analysis; 97 935 (58%) were women, 70 479 (42%) were men, and 129 816 (77%) were White. 5609 (3%) people were taking immunosuppressive medications. In patients receiving immunosuppressants, three doses of BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31\u201364; p<0\u00b70001) and three doses of mRNA-1273 had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (42\u201373; p<0\u00b70001) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three doses of either vaccine had an effectiveness of 87% (95% CI 73\u201393; p<0\u00b70001) against hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Receipt of immunosuppressive DMARDs (hazard ratio 2\u00b732, 95% CI 1\u00b723\u20134\u00b738; p=0\u00b70097) or glucocorticoids (2\u00b793, 1\u00b777\u20134\u00b786; p<0\u00b70001) and a history of organ or bone marrow transplantation (3\u00b752, 2\u00b701\u20136\u00b716; p<0\u00b70001) were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared with those who had not received immunosuppressive medications or transplant. We did a retrospective cohort study and included vaccinated and unvaccinated people aged 18 years or older in the Michigan Medicine health-care system, USA, during the omicron-dominant period of the pandemic (Dec 16, 2021\u2013March 4, 2022). We collected data from electronic health records (demographics, diagnoses, medications) combined with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry to determine vaccination status, and we collected COVID-19-related hospitalisation data by chart review. We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar time to assess the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines in people taking immunosuppressive medications (conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], biologic DMARDs, or glucocorticoids within the past 3 months), while controlling for participant characteristics. Using the same model, we assessed the effect of different classes of medication such as immunosuppressive DMARDs, immunomodulatory DMARDs, and glucocorticoids on SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. All analyses were done using complete cases after removing participants with missing covariates. There is a scarcity of research regarding the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines in patients taking immunosuppressant medications, and no data are published to date pertaining to their effectiveness against omicron (B.1.1.529) variant SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation. We aimed to assess the relationship between immunosuppressive medications, mRNA vaccination, omicron infection, and severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, hospitalisation, ICU admission, death). We aimed to assess the relationship between immunosuppressive medications, mRNA vaccination, omicron infection, and severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalisation or intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to COVID-19, in a large cohort of patients in the USA. In people who are immunosuppressed, COVID-19 vaccines can provide some protection against omicron infection and are highly effective against hospitalisation caused by this variant. Nonetheless, people taking immunosuppressive medications remain at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalisation due to COVID-19, relative to the general population. It is crucially important that people in this group are prioritised and that they remain up to date on vaccinations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in patients taking immunosuppressive medications. Moreover, we performed detailed analysis on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 associated with different types of immunosuppressive medications in a larger study population than in most previous studies. Access to chart-reviewed COVID-19 hospitalisation data is also a major strength of this study, as this reduces bias due to the inclusion of patients hospitalised for other reasons. In patients taking immunosuppressive medications, we found strong protection against COVID-19 hospitalisation due to the omicron variant among recipients of two doses or three doses of either the mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccine. We also found that three doses of BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31\u201364) and three doses of mRNA-1273 had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (42\u201373) against SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection. We found increased risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in patients taking glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and in transplant recipients compared with those not taking these medications or who had not received a transplant. We searched major rheumatology journals (including The Lancet Rheumatology , Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, Arthritis and Rheumatology , and others) and PubMed on April 5, 2022, for studies published in English, with no date restrictions, using the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cimmunosuppressed\u201d, \u201cimmunocompromised\u201d, \u201crheumatic diseases\u201d, \u201cauto-immune disease\u201d, SARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cinfection\u201d, and \u201chospitalisation\u201d to identify studies on COVID-19 risk in patients taking immunosuppressive medications, and using combinations of the same search terms in addition to \u201cvaccines\u201d, \u201cefficacy\u201d, \u201cimmunogenicity\u201d, \u201comicron\u201d, \u201cdelta\u201d, and \u201ceffectiveness\u201d to identify studies on vaccine effectiveness in patients taking immunosuppressive medications. Previous research on vaccine effectiveness in people who are immunosuppressed is scarce, although COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective against previously circulating variants in this populaton. Some immunosuppressive medications, including glucocorticoids, rituximab, and JAK inhibitors, have been shown to increase risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and death. The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines have been shown to be safe and highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes in clinical trials and became the first two COVID-19 vaccines to be approved in the USA. However, patients taking immunosuppressive medications were excluded from these trials.The paucity of data regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in patients who are immunosuppressed has persisted throughout the pandemic, as observational studies have mostly not included a sufficient sample size or the necessary medication data to conduct analyses in this population. Following WHO designation on Nov 26, 2021, the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant spread rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide. Initial findings among immunocompetent people showed that two doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines provides low protection against symptomatic omicron infection, although receipt of a third dose substantially increases protection.Multiple studies in patients who are immunosuppressed have shown mRNA vaccines to be effective against infection and hospitalisation due to the previously dominant delta (B.1.617.2) variant, but there are few data regarding their effectiveness against the omicron variant.Patients taking immunosuppressive medications have reduced immune responses following vaccination compared with immunocompetent people, but granular data about classes of immunosuppressive medications and dose level are still scarce.In addition to vaccine effectiveness, there is little knowledge on how taking immunosuppressive medications affects risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. There is evidence of increased risk of hospitalisation and severe outcomes from COVID-19 for some specific immunosuppressive medications, such as rituximab, JAK inhibitors, and glucocorticoids, but no studies have investigated all SARS-CoV-2 infections. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who had cancer in the year before baseline, on the basis of ICD-10 codes. The IPW Kaplan-Meier method was used to visually display the differences between groups after removing the confounding effects, but all further analysis was conducted in the unweighted sample using Cox regression adjusted for the aforementioned covariates, and the vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 \u2013 HR. The assumption of proportional hazards was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. We used Cox regression to compare patients who received two or three doses of vaccine with unvaccinated patients with the same medication status. Patients were included in the two-dose group 14 days after receipt of their second dose and included in the three-dose group 7 days after receipt of their third dose. Given the strong possibility that covariates, such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, would have different effects between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients, we fit separate Cox models for the two groups when assessing vaccine effectiveness. We also used a Cox model to assess the effect of different immunosuppressant medication types on infection and hospitalisation, controlling for the aforementioned covariates, including vaccination status. The primary objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness in patients taking immunosuppressive medications, with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 as primary endpoints. Secondary objectives were to assess the COVID-19 risk associated with different types of immunosuppressive medication and transplantation status, and vaccine effectiveness among immunocompetent people. All analyses were conducted using complete cases after removing patients with missing covariates. Statistical analyses for SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and ICU admission due to COVID-19 were conducted on a calendar time scale, with time to infection, hospitalisation, or ICU admission measured from Dec 16, 2021, for all patients, to control for time-varying confounders, such as the community prevalence of COVID-19.Dec 16 was chosen as the study start date to correspond with the timepoint at which omicron became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the USA.If infection or hospitalisation occurred twice in the same patient within the study period, only the first instance of each was included in the analysis. We studied vaccination as a time-varying covariate, with vaccinated individuals included in the unvaccinated group before receipt of their first dose and excluded from the analysis from date of their first dose until 14 days after receipt of their second dose. Patients were censored at the date of receiving a fourth dose of vaccine, death, or March 4, 2022, whichever occurred first. To balance patient covariates between vaccine groups and immunosuppressive medication groups, the inverse propensity weighted (IPW)Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative incidence curves, and IPW Cox proportional hazards regression was used for comparison between curves. Propensity scores were estimated using a multinomial logistic regression with the dependent variable comprised of four groups: vaccinated immunosuppressed, vaccinated immunocompetent, unvaccinated immunosuppressed, and unvaccinated immunocompetent. The independent variables were age, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, sex, race, number of hospital visits, number of negative SARS-CoV-2 tests recorded before baseline, transplantation status, and Charlson comorbidity index. The Charlson comorbidity index is a weighted sum of 19 conditions, with a weight of 1\u20136 for each condition, based on the estimated 1-year mortality hazard ratio (HR) from a Cox proportional hazards model, and was obtained using the R package comorbidity.All covariates were categorised to account for non-linear effects, and group balance was assessed based on differences between proportions in the weighted sample. The number of hospital visits and negative SARS-CoV-2 tests before baseline were included to reduce informed presence bias,which occurs due to differing degrees of interaction with the health-care system between comparison groups. Controlling for negative tests is particularly important as it reflects an individual's propensity to seek testing and mitigates the potential bias from different rates of testing between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients or vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We identified SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of ICD-10 code U07.1 and laboratory test results. Reinfections were SARS-CoV-2 infections that occurred at least 90 days after any previously identified infection ( appendix p 2 ). Hospitalisation was identified using chart review and only included patients in whom COVID-19 was the cause of hospitalisation. ICU stay and death data were identified using chart review. We identified patients who were immunosuppressed as those taking conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic DMARDs, or glucocorticoids ( appendix p 3 ) within 3 months before baseline. Patients were required to have a prescription that covered at least half of this 3-month period, or two separate prescriptions at least 30 days apart (to account for immunosuppressants given via injection). In this retrospective cohort study, we included vaccinated and unvaccinated people aged 18 years or older in the Michigan Medicine health-care system, USA, during the omicron-dominant period of the pandemic (Dec 16, 2021\u2013March 4, 2022). We used electronic health records (EHRs) at Michigan Medicine (including patient demographics, International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10] codes, medications, and laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2), combined with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry and chart-reviewed COVID-19 hospitalisation data. EHR data were linked to the immunisation database at the Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR) to determine vaccination status (including dose number and date) for each patient. MCIR documents immunisations given to Michigan residents throughout life and so includes all statewide immunisations, even those administered outside of Michigan Medicine. We included patients who were registered with a primary care physician at Michigan Medicine and had at least one primary care physician visit within the past 18 months. We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years or were vaccinated with a vaccine other than mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. Comorbidities and number of hospital visits were assessed based on diagnosis codes in the 18 months before baseline (defined as Dec 16, 2021). Transplantation status was determined on the basis of the presence of ICD-10 code Z94 within the 12 months before baseline. The study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (HUM00164771) with a waiver of patient consent, given the use of deidentified EHR data. In the sensitivity analysis excluding patients with cancer (n=9115), the findings remained the same regarding vaccine effectiveness in relation to immunosuppressant medication (data not shown). Nine deaths (0\u00b75 per 10 000 patients) due to COVID-19 were recorded during the study period. 25 patients had an admission to the ICU during the study period, with a higher rate of ICU admission among patients who were immunosuppressed (four patients; 7\u00b71 ICU admissions per 10 000 patients) than among those who were immunocompetent (21; 1\u00b73 per 10 000). Based on analysis including all patients in the study, receiving either two (vaccine effectiveness 92%, 95% CI 66\u201398; p=0\u00b70007) or three doses (91%, 75\u201397; p<0\u00b70001) of either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the mRNA-1273 vaccine was highly effective in reducing the risk of ICU admission ( appendix p 11 ). The proportional hazards assumption was satisfied for all covariates in all models based on Schoenfeld residual plots. Among those who were immunocompetent, male sex was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with female sex (HR 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b781\u20130\u00b793; p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 5 ). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and sex among patients who were immunosuppressed (HR 0\u00b799, 95% CI 0\u00b778\u20131\u00b727; p=0\u00b794; appendix p 6 ), and no association between sex and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in either those who were immunocompetent (1\u00b702, 0\u00b773\u20131\u00b743; p=0\u00b791; appendix p 7 ) or those who were immunosuppressed (0\u00b793, 0\u00b751\u20131\u00b771; p=0\u00b783; appendix p 8 ). Black patients were at higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than patients of other races in both the immunosuppressed (HR 2\u00b735, 95% CI 1\u00b723\u20134\u00b750; p=0\u00b7010) and immunocompetent (1\u00b777, 1\u00b714\u20132\u00b773; p=0\u00b7011) groups ( appendix pp 7\u20138 ). Immunosuppressive DMARDs (HR 2\u00b732, 95% CI 1\u00b723\u20134\u00b738; p=0\u00b70097) and glucocorticoids (2\u00b793, 1\u00b777\u20134\u00b786; p<0\u00b70001) were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared with not taking any immunosuppressant. Patients who had received a bone marrow or organ transplant were again at higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (HR 3\u00b752, 95% CI 2\u00b701\u20136\u00b716; p<0\u00b70001) than patients who had not received a transplant. Due to small sample size in these groups, there was less certainty in our estimates of COVID-19-related hospitalisation risk for patients taking immunomodulatory DMARDs (HR 2\u00b702, 95% CI 0\u00b764\u20136\u00b737; p=0\u00b723) and those taking multiple immunosuppressant medication types (1\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b790\u20134\u00b701; p=0\u00b7090). Full Cox regression results for COVID-19-related hospitalisation risk by immunosuppressant type are shown in the appendix (p 10) 1852 patients were taking immunosuppressive DMARDs only (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and others), 884 were taking immunomodulatory DMARDs only (hydroxychloroquine, mesalamine, sulfasalazine and others), and 1971 were taking glucocorticoids only (prednisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and others; appendix pp 3\u20134 ). 902 patients were taking medications from multiple categories and were considered as a separate group. After controlling for patient characteristics, including vaccination status, immunosuppressive DMARDs (HR 1\u00b739, 95% CI 1\u00b713\u20131\u00b772; p=0\u00b70022), glucocorticoids (1\u00b748, 1\u00b721\u20131\u00b780; p=0\u00b70001), and a combination of immunosuppressant medications from multiple categories (1\u00b758, 1\u00b721\u20132\u00b706; p=0\u00b70008) were associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with not taking any immunosuppressant. However, no increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed with immunomodulatory DMARDs (HR 1\u00b704, 95% CI 0\u00b772\u20131\u00b749; p=0\u00b785) compared with taking no immunosuppressant ( appendix p 9 ). Patients who had received a bone marrow or organ transplant were at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1\u00b770, 95% CI 1\u00b733\u20132\u00b718; p<0.0001) than patients who had not received a transplant, after adjusting for immunosuppressive medication type and patient characteristics. Due to the low sample size in the immunosuppressed group, it was not feasible to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation due to COVID-19 by vaccine product. Three doses of either vaccine was strongly protective against hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in patients who were immunosuppressed (vaccine effectiveness 87%, 95% CI 74\u201393; p<0\u00b70001) and in those who were immunocompetent (92%, 87\u201395; p<0\u00b70001). Two doses of either vaccine also showed substantial protection against hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in both patients who were immunosuppressed (vaccine effectiveness 85%, 95% CI 62\u201394; p<0\u00b70001) and those who were immunocompetent (68%, 53\u201378; p<0\u00b70001). Full Cox regression results for hospitalisation are shown in the appendix (pp 7\u20138 ). Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided no protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in either patients who were immunosuppressed (vaccine effectiveness 13%, 95% CI \u201319 to 39; p=0\u00b743) or immunocompetent (\u22126%, \u201314 to 4; p=0\u00b724; figure 3 ). By contrast, three doses of the BNT162b2 had a vaccine effectiveness of 50% (95% CI 31 to 64; p<0\u00b70001) in patients who were immunosuppressed and 35% in those who were immunocompetent (29 to 41; p<0\u00b70001). Two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both patients who were immunosuppressed (vaccine effectiveness 57%, 95% CI 29 to 74; p=0\u00b70011) and those who were immunocompetent (16%, 5 to 26; p=0\u00b70043). Three doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine had a vaccine effectiveness of 60% (95% CI 42 to 73; p<0\u00b70001) in patients who were immunosuppressed and 57% (51 to 62; p<0\u00b70001) in those who were immunocompetent. Full Cox regression results for SARS-CoV-2 infection are provided in the appendix (pp 5\u20136 ). In all patients, after weighting based on inverse propensity scores, covariates were well balanced between vaccination (vaccinated vs unvaccinated) and medication (immunosuppressed vs immunocompetent) groups. Covariate balance before and after weighting is shown in the appendix (pp 14\u201315 ). SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were higher in patients who were immunosuppressed than in those who were immunocompetent in both the vaccinated (p=0\u00b7030 in IPW Cox regression) and unvaccinated groups (p=0\u00b70003) after adjusting for confounders ( figure 1 ). Rates of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 were higher in patients who were immunosuppressed than in those who were immunocompetent in the unvaccinated group (p=0\u00b70003) after adjusting for confounders, whereas the difference was not significant in the vaccinated group (p=0\u00b710; figure 2 ). Vaccinated participants had received two or three doses of either vaccine. We studied vaccination as a time-varying covariate, with vaccinated individuals included in the unvaccinated group before receipt of their first dose and excluded from the analysis from date of their first dose until 14 days after receipt of their second dose. Vaccinated participants had received two or three doses of either vaccine. We studied vaccination as a time-varying covariate, with vaccinated individuals included in the unvaccinated group before receipt of their first dose and excluded from the analysis from date of their first dose until 14 days after receipt of their second dose. Second vaccine doses were received across a range of dates in March and April, 2021, whereas third doses were received from October to December, 2021, with people taking immunosuppressive medications generally receiving third doses earlier than people who were immunocompetent, due to prioritisation. Third doses of mRNA-1273 were half doses relative to the initial two vaccinations (50 mcg vs 100 mcg). Patients who were immunosuppressed were more likely to seek SARS-CoV-2 testing (3323 [59%] of 5609 patients who were immunosuppressed had at least one negative test in the 18 months before baseline, compared with 52 784 [32%] of 162 805 patients who were immunocompetent). Patient covariates by vaccination status and immunosuppression are shown in the table 209 492 people were identified in Michigan Medicine, including 165 913 who were vaccinated and 43 579 who were unvaccinated. 41 078 people were excluded because they were younger than 18 years, partially vaccinated (ie, received one dose), had received a vaccine other than the two vaccines studied, or had incomplete covariate data. The frequency of missing data was low, with 2597 people missing race data, and 11 missing sex data. 168 414 people were included in the analysis, 5609 (3%) of whom were taking immunosuppressive medications. The population for analysis had a median age of 49 years (IQR 33\u201363), 97 935 (58%) were women and 70 479 (42%) were men, and 129 816 (77%) were White ( table ). SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations for vaccinated individuals are listed as long as they occurred during the study period, regardless of whether they occurred before vaccination, after partial vaccination, or after full vaccination. Number of visits was defined as the number of in-person hospital visits for the patient within the 18 months before Dec 16, 2021. Transplantation status determined on the basis of the presence of International Classification of Diseases-10 code Z94 within the 12 months before Dec 16, 2021. Discussion We found that the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines provided strong protection against COVID-19-related hospitalisation in patients who were immunosuppressed during the omicron-dominant SARS-CoV-2 wave in the USA. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection was not as substantial, but we found that patients who were immunosuppressed who received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or three doses of either vaccine had significant protection. Despite higher effectiveness estimates in patients who were immunosuppressed than those who were immunocompentent, those who were immunosuppressed were at higher risk of infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than were those who were immunocompetent. It has been hypothesised that reduced antibody responses would lead to lower vaccine effectiveness in patients who are immunosuppressed. Our findings contradict this hypothesis, possibly due to higher baseline (pre-vaccine) vulnerability in patients who were immunosuppressed leading to a larger relative increase in immune protection, or differences in wider immune response (eg, T-cells). Moreover, our estimates for vaccine effectiveness are uncertain, and for all vaccine series, except two doses of mRNA-1273, the differences in effectiveness between patients who were immunosuppressed and those who were immunocompetent were not significant. Controlling for patient characteristics, including vaccination status, we found that patients taking glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive DMARDs were at higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients not taking immunosuppressants. Patients who had received a bone marrow or organ transplant were particularly vulnerable to both hospitalisation and infection and remained at high risk even after vaccination with either vaccine. 23 Bower H Frisell T Di Giuseppe D et al.

Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases using immunosuppressants: a substudy of two prospective cohort studies. Two large studies conducted before mass vaccination occurred found no increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, critical care admission, or death associated with most immunosuppressant medications.A study that assessed severe outcomes (ie, mechanical ventilation, death) found that immunosuppressant medications were not associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, with some exceptions.All of these studies analysed more severe endpoints (mechanical ventilation and death) than did our study (infection and hospitalisation). Some of these studies accounted for underlying immune-mediated inflammatory diseasesor used a standard therapy control group rather than the general population.The major advantages of our study are that we analysed data obtained during the omicron-dominant SARS-CoV-2 wave rather than timeframes dominated by previous variants, and that\u2014unlike other post-vaccination studies\u2014we controlled for vaccination status, which is an important confounder (unbalanced between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients). Another study did not find increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated immunosuppressed people compared with the immunocompetent vaccinated population.Compared with our study, that study had information on underlying immune-mediated inflammatory diseases but used a less restrictive definition of immunosuppression and did not account for a higher incidence of third vaccine doses in the immunosuppressed population. Nonetheless, all of these findings could be consistent with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with some specific potent immunosuppressants but not with other immunosuppressant medications. Further studies in larger patient populations, which can account for vaccination status while studying individual immunosuppressants, are needed to determine the true effect of individual medications. 5 Shen C Risk M Schiopu E et al.

COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. Our findings regarding vaccine effectiveness in immunosuppressed patients show a substantial reduction in effectiveness relative to previous studies that looked at the delta (B.1.617.2) variant.This difference is consistent with a similar reduction in the immunocompetent population, as seen in this study and in previous work.The higher effectiveness observed for the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine is also in accordance with previous findings in people who were immunocompetent.However, the reduced risk of infection observed in mRNA-1273 recipients might be primarily explained by higher doses in the initial two vaccinations compared with BNT162b2, rather than the reduced third dose (50 mcg vs 100 mcg). 25 Andersen KM Bates BA Rashidi ES et al.

With the advent of more transmissible variants, such as the BA.2 and BA.5 subvariants of omicron, the protection afforded by two or three vaccine doses is likely to deteriorate further and leave people taking immunosuppressants at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Our findings underscore the importance of vaccination in patients taking immunosuppressants, especially given the robust evidence that vaccines are safe in this group. 29 Peckham H de Gruijter NM Raine C et al.

Disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status: a systematic-review and meta-analysis. Previous research has suggested that there are minimal differences in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection between male and female sex, with patients of male sex having a higher risk of ICU admission and death.We found similar risks of omicron infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation between males and females but did not have sufficient sample size to assess differences in risk of ICU admission or death. The slightly elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among females in the immunocompetent population might be explained by region-specific factors, such as a large, majority-female population of health-care workers, or by differences in willingness to seek testing between males and females. Our finding that Black patients were at elevated risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation compared with White patients is similar to findings from other studies. Our study has several strengths that allow for more detailed analysis relative to previous work. We linked EHR data with immunisation data from the Michigan State Registry, allowing us to capture data on vaccinations received outside of Michigan Medicine. We considered a comprehensive list of immunosuppressant medications, allowing us to study different types of immunosuppressants, including immunosuppressive DMARDs, immunomodulatory DMARDs, and glucocorticoids. The availability of chart-reviewed COVID-19 hospitalisation data allowed us to accurately assess vaccine effectiveness during the omicron-dominant period of the pandemic, when high infection rates might have led to many incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among patients who were hospitalised for other reasons. There are several limitations to this study, mostly related to using EHR data from a single institution and under-reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The sample size from a single institution limits our ability to examine individual immunosuppressant medications and mortality rate. Michigan Medicine has 15 primary care sites across a four-county area and the catchment area for these clinics crosses several more counties, so patients might seek care at other facilities outside the Michigan Medicine system, leading to missing infection data. However, the use of the number of negative tests before the study period and the number of hospital visits as covariates is an effective method of controlling for the propensity to seek care and testing. We found that the previous number of negative SARS-CoV-2 tests and hospital visits were highly predictive of observed infections during the study period. This allowed us to reduce bias due to differing degrees of interaction with the Michigan Medicine system between those who were immunosuppressed and those who were immunocompetent, or between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The requirement of at least one visit with a primary care physician within the past 18 months ensured that patients had more complete follow-up data, but this might have led to selection of a slightly older population with more comorbidities than the general population; therefore, incidence of hospitalisation might be overestimated. However, this should not have affected comparisons between vaccine groups and immunosuppressant medication groups after correction for confounders. 24 MacKenna B Kennedy NA Mehrkar A et al.

COVID-19 outcomes in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases compared to the general population: a US multicenter, comparative cohort study. Immunosuppressants are given for a wide variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and gastrointestinal or endocrine disorders. Previous studies indicate that autoimmune diseases can increase risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death, although the degree of effect depends on the severity of the underlying condition.Therefore, we cannot determine whether higher infection or hospitalisation rates are due to the medications themselves, target organ involvement, or the underlying conditions they are prescribed for. Due to sample size constraints, we aggregated medications into groups and so could not investigate individual medications, the effects of which might differ depending on mode of action or potency. Given the absence of sequencing data, we could not fully guarantee that all recorded infections in our study period were caused by the omicron variant. However, given the rapid rise of omicron, it is likely that a large majority of cases after the study start date (Dec 16, 2021) were caused by this variant. Despite these limitations, our study fills an important gap in knowledge regarding the associations between vaccination, immunosuppressant medications, and the omicron variant. In patients taking immunosuppressants, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines can provide some protection against omicron infection and are highly effective against COVID-19-related hospitalisation caused by the omicron variant. It is crucially important that patients taking immunosuppressants are prioritised and remain up to date on vaccinations.",

        "text":"1 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations World Organisation for Animal Health WHO Global Database for the Tripartite Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Country Self-assessment Survey (TrACSS). The COVID-19 pandemic inflicted a new burden on health systems worldwide and compounded existing health challenges across many aspects of global health. According to the annual Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey 2020\u201321, 151 (94%) of 161 countries ascribed the pandemic as having impacted their national response to tackling antimicrobial resistance.An acute increase in the burden of antimicrobial resistance was thus a feared outcome of the pandemic, but this speculation had not been comprehensively measured. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19: US impact on antimicrobial resistance, special report 2022. A new special report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is among the first to show country-level estimates of the effect of COVID-19 on antimicrobial resistance in the USA.The report highlights a devastating undoing of progress in efforts to control antimicrobial resistance. Declines in death from antimicrobial resistance by 18% from 2012 to 2017, including a 30% reduction in US hospitals, were crudely reversed by a 15% increase in drug-resistant nosocomial infection rates in 2020, compared with the previous year. Pathogen\u2013drug combinations that were classified as critical by WHO and urgent by the CDC\u2014based on their risk to human health\u2014showed particularly alarming increases in rates of infection since the previous year (2019), with rates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections up 35%, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter increasing by 78% (appendix). 3 The White House National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, 2020\u20132025. These data signify a distinct undoing of progress towards the foremost goal of the US National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria\u2014built on the successes of infection prevention and control interventions across US hospitals\u2014to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections. The danger of allowing a continuation or sustenance of these trends is an evolutionary acceleration of the emergence of further multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and even pan-resistant organisms. In the absence of sustainable supply-side solutions, and with the ease at which pathogens can rapidly spread worldwide, the continuity of modern medicine is gravely endangered. These setbacks can and must be temporary. 4 Goldberg J Clezy K Jasovsk\u00fd D Uyen-Cateriano A Leaving no one behind: the need for a truly global response to antimicrobial resistance. We believe the path to recovery requires a broader shift in current approaches to tackling public health challenges. The most urgent health threats of the 21st century (eg, climate change, demographic shifts, infectious disease outbreaks, and antimicrobial resistance) together represent a complex predicament for modern medicine.The multisectoral complexity of modern health threats warrants bold, collaborative, strategic approaches with governance strategies embedded in a One Health framework\u2014an internationally recognised approach to develop and implement policy across human, animal, and environmental health sectors. For most countries, this means transitioning national health governance away from policy responses with variable priorities for vertical, disease-focused interventions, and instead recognising and capitalising on the shared benefits of horizontal efforts that strengthen health systems and promote combination prevention. Interventions that are strategically designed for broader benefits are advantageous both in terms of enhancing core capacities to prevent, detect, and manage acute health emergencies, and in the day-to-day functioning of health-care systems. We believe that developing health security with this economic framing should be able to encourage investments from governments. 5 Williamson A Forman R Azzopardi-Muscat N et al. Effective post-pandemic governance must focus on shared challenges. Responses to antimicrobial resistance in a post-pandemic era can be strengthened by increasing political and public realisation that health security is transnational. Governments and institutions can only protect the health of their populations by assuming a responsibility that the causes and consequences of health threats transcend national boundaries. Accordingly, policy makers should recognise the global externalities\u2014policy areas in which the actions (or inaction) of any nation can affect all global actors.We consider the USA, with support from the CDC, well positioned to initiate this leadership and rebuild post-pandemic public health capacities to steer large scale efforts. At least four major interconnected domains relevant to antimicrobial resistance control have been damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic (infection prevention and control, diagnostics, therapeutics development, and surveillance), but each present important opportunities for shared benefits across health security. 6 The Lancet Microbe Antimicrobial resistance is part of a perfect storm of health crises. The CDC are among the first groups to quantitatively characterise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial resistance at a national level. Their findings underscore an urgent need for a renewed focus on antimicrobial resistance to prevent a pandemic legacy becoming more damaging than COVID-19 itself. We must resist a naive assumption that the acute exacerbation in the burden of antimicrobial resistance will reach a natural recalibration, or that minor changes in existing structures will enable a return to pre-pandemic trends.Investment opportunities for substantial health, social, economic, and political dividends are clear, but policy makers must be prepared to take a long term view and transcend political cycles. Health leaders in the USA and other countries cannot overlook this opportunity to reverse the pandemic's damaging effect on antimicrobial resistance and rebuild the national and international architecture to meet multiple health challenges, simultaneously.

The detection of people with paralytic cases of wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) in two African countries (ie, Malawi in February, 2022, and Mozambique in May, 2022) outside endemic areas of WPV1 transmission (ie, Pakistan and Afghanistan) will become a serious setback if low vaccination coverage and decreased surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis are not addressed with alacrity.Detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks in new settings, including circulating vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) in Ukraine in October, 2021, circulating vaccine-derived type 3 poliovirus (cVDPV3) in Israel in March, 2022, and cVDPV2 in the USA in July, 2022, and the environmental detection of VDPV in sewage systems in London, UK, in June, 2022, show the serious threat of polio re-emergence in settings that had previously interrupted polio transmission.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial role in diminishing the activities of national polio control programmes (eg, reducing their ability to conduct routine and supplemental immunisation activities and reducing acute flaccid paralysis surveillance).The WPV1 type that was identified in two people in Malawi and Mozambique in 2022 has been epidemiologically linked to a viral strain that was previously identified in Pakistan in October, 2019, emphasising the ease of importation of wild poliovirus or VDPV unless high vaccination coverage (ie, >95%) is maintained along with investigation of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis, environmental monitoring, and outbreak response plans. 4 Clarke E Kampmann B No one is safe until everyone is safe-from polio too. 1 Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio this week. , 5 Franco-Paredes C Henao-Martinez AF Chauhan L Rodriguez-Morales AJ Khan MI Current challenges to achieving a polio free world. , 6 Lai YA Chen X Kunasekaran M Rahman B MacIntyre CR Global epidemiology of vaccine-derived poliovirus 2016\u20132021: a descriptive analysis and retrospective case-control study. The humoral response to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) prevents entry of wild poliovirus into the CNS and blocks replication on mucosal surfaces of the intestine.However, by acquiring atypical genetic properties, strains of VDPV circulate in the environment, resulting in sustained person-to-person transmission. These strains, with reverted neurovirulence, can produce paralysis similarly to wild poliovirus in populations with low OPV coverage.Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) offers protection against paralytic disease by inducing a strong humoral response but confers a weak mucosal response. 1 Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio this week. 3 PAHO\/WHO Epidemiological alert: detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in the United States: implications for the region of the Americas\u201421 July 2022. , 4 Clarke E Kampmann B No one is safe until everyone is safe-from polio too. Global immunisation efforts and high-quality surveillance led to the last human case of wild poliovirus type 2 in 1999. By 2012, the last wild poliovirus type 3 infection was identified. Certification of eradication occurred in 2015 for wild poliovirus type 2 and 2019 for wild poliovirus type 3 infection.However, endemic WPV1 transmission persists as a major concern in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Outside the endemic settings of WPV1 transmission, most cases of paralytic polio have been caused by circulating VDPV types in environments with low immunisation coverage. 5 Franco-Paredes C Henao-Martinez AF Chauhan L Rodriguez-Morales AJ Khan MI Current challenges to achieving a polio free world. 1 Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio this week. , 4 Clarke E Kampmann B No one is safe until everyone is safe-from polio too. 5 Franco-Paredes C Henao-Martinez AF Chauhan L Rodriguez-Morales AJ Khan MI Current challenges to achieving a polio free world. 2 Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud Alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica: riesgo de brote por virus polio. , 3 PAHO\/WHO Epidemiological alert: detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in the United States: implications for the region of the Americas\u201421 July 2022. 2 Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud Alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica: riesgo de brote por virus polio. 2 Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud Alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica: riesgo de brote por virus polio. , 3 PAHO\/WHO Epidemiological alert: detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in the United States: implications for the region of the Americas\u201421 July 2022. 5 Franco-Paredes C Henao-Martinez AF Chauhan L Rodriguez-Morales AJ Khan MI Current challenges to achieving a polio free world. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, global efforts for the eradication of polio were suffering from the spread of outbreaks of cVDPV2 in many regions due to a fall below the 95% poliovirus vaccine coverage.The eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 in 2015 was followed by a globally coordinated switch to bivalent OPV containing only type 1 and type 3 attenuated viruses.This vaccination strategy was designed to reduce the risks of outbreaks of cVDPV2 and to boost immunity to the other serotypes. However, this globally synchronised transition occurred in early 2016 when IPV coverage was suboptimal in many settings, allowing the introduction of cVDPV2 in many countries.Most regions with outbreaks of VDPV in the past 12 months have been in Africa (cVDPV2) until detection of cVDPV3 in Israel and detection of VDPV2 in the USA.Although the Americas were certified free of polio in 1994, it is considered at high risk of resurgence given reductions in poliovirus vaccination activities and surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis. The Pan American Health Organization reported that, by 2020, only 80% of children received the third dose of poliovirus vaccine durine routine immunisation activities, which constituted a marked reduction compared with 2019.In the Americas, vaccination coverage has decreased to below 95% in 33 of 42 countries.Additionally, in endemic settings of WPV1 transmission, the vertical approach of polio control (ie, concentrating public health activities to only one disease) has led to programme fatigue and vaccine hesitancy, which has promoted programmatic deficits that, along with the ongoing civilian unrest, have left many clusters of children unvaccinated. 7 Martin J Burns CC Jorba J et al.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the challenges in maintaining uniform vaccine coverage in every district or region by use of either OPVs or IPVs, which might eventually permit the rapid spread of cases of cVDPV2 in many settings and the threat of WPV1 reappearing in countries that have previously interrupted its circulation.The realities of modern times, including competing public health priorities, geopolitical barriers, civil conflicts, and the risk of future pandemics, hinder governmental prioritisation of maintaining uniform vaccine coverage for global eradication of all circulating types of polioviruses. 8 Franco-Paredes C Santos-Preciado JI Henao-Martinez AF Rodriguez-Morales AJ Carrasco P Preventing paralytic polio caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. 2 Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud Alerta epidemiol\u00f3gica: riesgo de brote por virus polio. , 3 PAHO\/WHO Epidemiological alert: detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in the United States: implications for the region of the Americas\u201421 July 2022. 9 Higuita NA Suarez JA Millender E et al.

Implementing IPVs in all settings during routine and supplementary immunisation activities is central to reducing paralytic polio and fostering mucosal immunity among people with a previous history of OPV vaccination.The ministries of health in all countries should achieve uniform vaccination coverage of more than 95% at national, subnational, and district levels. In settings with circulation of WPV1 or cVDPV, supplemental vaccination strategies, such as mass vaccination during national immunisation days, should be considered to maintain the highest levels of immunity. Countries that have implemented an initial dose of IPV need to introduce a second dose.Additionally, decision makers should consider immunisation of travellers, people in war-torn areas, and migrants in transit from settings with endemic transmission or from locations with ongoing outbreaks of circulating VDPV.

        "text":"This work is part of the Grand Challenges ICODA pilot initiative, delivered by Health Data Research UK and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Minderoo Foundation. This study was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. In Brazil, socioeconomic disparities negatively impacted the first dose vaccination rate. However, the primary health care mitigated these disparities, suggesting that the primary health care coverage guarantees more equitable access to vaccines in vulnerable locations. From January 17 to August 31, 2021, 202,427,355 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in Brazil. By the end of the period, 64\u00b72% of adults had first and 31\u00b74% second doses, with more than 90% of those aged \u226560 years with primary scheme completed. Four distinct vaccine platforms were used in the country, ChAdOx1-S\/nCoV-19, Sinovac-CoronaVac, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, composing 44\u00b78%, 33\u00b72%, 19\u00b76%, and 2\u00b74% of total doses, respectively. First dose coverage differed between municipalities with high, medium, and low HDI (Median [interquartile range] 72 [66, 79], 68 [61, 75] and 63 [55, 70] doses per 100 people, respectively). Municipalities with low (Rate Ratio [RR, 95% confidence interval]: 0\u00b787 [0\u00b785-0\u00b788]) and medium (RR [95% CI]: 0\u00b794 [0\u00b793-0\u00b795]) development were independently associated with lower vaccination rates compared to those with high HDI. Primary health care coverage modified the association of HDI and vaccination rate, improving vaccination rates in those municipalities of low HDI and high primary health care coverage. Low HDI municipalities presented a delayed decrease in adjusted in-hospital death rates by first dose coverage compared to high HDI locations. We performed an ecological analysis of COVID-19 immunisation data from the Brazilian National Immunization Program from January 17 to August 31, 2021. We analysed the dynamics of vaccine coverage in the adult population of 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. We estimated the association of human development index (HDI) levels (low, medium, and high) with age-sex standardised first dose coverage using a multivariable negative binomial regression model. We evaluated the interaction between the HDI and primary health care coverage. Finally, we compared the adjusted monthly progression of vaccination rates, hospital admission and in-hospital death rates among HDI levels. There is limited information on the inequity of access to vaccination in low-and-middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we described the progression of the Brazilian immunisation program for COVID-19, and the association of socioeconomic development with vaccination rates, considering the potential protective effect of primary health care coverage. Socioeconomic disparities have impacted the distribution, access, and administration of COVID-19 vaccine doses worldwide, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. In Brazil, municipalities with low socioeconomic development showed decreased first dose vaccination rates compared to highly developed locations. This low vaccination coverage may be related to limited access to vaccination by socially vulnerable populations. Universal healthcare coverage, with the presence of primary health care in vulnerable communities and cost-free vaccination, is a major driving force guaranteeing equitable access to vaccines by vulnerable populations and effective control of the pandemic. We performed an ecological analysis of nationwide COVID-19 immunisation data from the Brazilian National Immunization Program (PNI). The PNI is part of the Brazilian Universal Healthcare system (SUS) and has been recognised as a model of vaccination campaigns and population adhesion, being present in all 5,570 municipalities. During the first seven months of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, more than 200 million doses were administered with distinct rates throughout the country. We observed that municipalities with low human development index (HDI) were associated with decreased first dose vaccination rates compared to those with higher HDI. The primary health care coverage was associated with increased first dose rates in those municipalities with low HDI, thus reducing the difference among locations. In addition, the progression of the pandemic control was slower in municipalities with low HDI compared to highly developed locations. We searched PubMed for nationwide studies on estimating the association of social vulnerability, inequity, and human development with COVID-19 vaccine coverage, focusing on low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched for studies published in English, from database inception to February 25, 2022, using the following search terms: \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d OR \u201cCOVID-19\u201d OR \u201cCOVID\u201d AND \u201cvaccination\u201d OR \u201ccoverage\u201d OR \u201cuptake\u201d OR \u201cvaccination campaign\u201d AND \u201cinequity\u201d OR \u201csocioeconomic\u201d OR \u201chuman development\u201d. Four out of five studies used national or regional data from high-income counties. Two studies from the UK analysed cohorts with people over 50 or 70 years old and focused on estimating the association of social vulnerability aspects such as race, skin colour or ethnicity, and living in deprived areas with vaccine uptake. Similarly, one study from Israel analysed differences in vaccine rates among distinct socioeconomic statuses and ethnicity. One study from the US analysed the differences in vaccine coverage among social vulnerability at the municipality and county levels. Regarding LMICs, we found one study on Bangladesh that describes the vaccination campaign in the country, however it was not an ecological design, nor it estimated the association of inequity and vaccination rates directly. Hence, there is scarce information on the inequity of access to COVID-19 vaccination in LMICs. It is unclear whether socioeconomic disparities have affected the vaccination rates in Brazil. We hypothesise that municipalities with low socioeconomic development had an increased hurdle in the progression of the vaccination campaign. Here, we described the progression of the Brazilian immunisation program for COVID-19, the association of socioeconomic development with vaccination rates and the potential protective effect of primary health care coverage. The National Immunization Program (PNI) is part of the SUS and has been recognised as a model of vaccination campaigns and population adhesion.Immunisation actions are included in prevention activities developed by the PHC, such as managing vaccination rooms and staffing, administering vaccine doses, and reporting and monitoring of adverse events. However, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign has posed new challenges. The campaign started without a nationally coordinated strategy, aiming for a speedy vaccination roll-out, and faced a high burden of the pandemic simultaneously to its execution. Brazil is an upper-middle-income country with a heterogeneous population distribution over an extensive territorial area. The country has substantial inequalities and other socioeconomic vulnerabilities. The presence of a decentralised, universal public health system (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade \u2013 SUS) has been an essential factor in reducing inequities and providing the most vulnerable population with access to healthcare resources.The system's operation is driven mainly by the primary health care (PHC) services at the municipalities, such as the family health strategy (FHS), which is the main primary health program policy adopted. However, there are still challenges in guaranteeing universal coverage over the country. The national health services of brazil and northern europe: universality, equity, and integrality\u2014time has come for the latter. Socioeconomic determinants and the way healthcare systems are organised may impact vaccination coverage. Additionally, the vaccination progression variability may result in delayed mitigation or control of the disease. Access to vaccines is a function of complex chains, including the production, distribution, and administration of this often-scarce resource.Characterising potential differences in access to vaccines and identifying their underlying mechanisms is essential to guarantee equitable access to vaccination among nations or within their territory. Vaccine inequity has contributed to prolonging the pandemic burden and generating new variants of concern (VoC).Limited access to COVID-19 vaccines by vulnerable populations has marked the vaccination campaign globally.High-income countries have concentrated dose acquisition, and poor nations are still struggling to provide their population with access to vaccines and immunisation capacity. Although much has been discussed about differences in access to vaccines between rich and poor countries,limited information is available on the inequity of access to vaccination within countries, especially from Low-and-Middle-Income countries (LMIC). The funders had no role in any decision about the manuscript. All authors had full access to all the data in the study, LSLB, SA, BR, and OTR verified the data, and all authors approved the final version of the manuscript for publication We performed three sensitivity analyses to evaluate the estimates of our negative binomial model. First, we evaluated the association between the continuous HDI measure and the standardised first dose rates adjusted by the same covariates. Second, we estimated the association of HDI levels and the standardised first dose rates including the healthcare workers rates per 10,000 population for each municipality in January 2021 as a covariate (data was obtained from the National Registry of Health Facilities - CNES). Third, using the main model, we estimated the association of HDI levels and standardised first dose rates for the subset of doses administered in those older than 60 years old that were eligible by the age-based calendar. The former two analysis were performed to observe the estimated association without the effect of potential priority groups in the vaccination campaign. A significance level of 0.05 was considered for statistical tests. All the analysis was performed in R 4.2.1. We followed STROBE recommendations. Thirdly, we compared the monthly vaccination rates and the COVID-19 pandemic stratified by HDI level from January to August 2021. To evaluate the pandemic progression related to first dose vaccination, we estimated the ratios between the standardised hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths rates and the standardised first dose rates for each municipality and month. We computed the average standardised rates per 1000 doses for each month and stratified by the HDI level and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Using a random-effects log-linear model (Appendix 2 p 6), we estimated each HDI level's average percentage growth rate (AGPR). The response variable was the standardised rate per 1000 doses, the predictor was the month, and the random intercept was the municipality. The APGR was obtained from the interaction term between the HDI level and the month. Secondly, we estimated the association of HDI and the vaccination rates using a multivariable Negative Binomial regression model. The dependent variable was the standardised first dose vaccination rate, and the main exposure of interest was the human development index (considering High HDI as reference). As covariates, we considered the municipality's population size, the population density, the degree of urbanisation, the GINI index, the distance to the State capital (in kilometres, measured as the linear distance between the municipalities' and their state capitals' administrative seats), and the rate of COVID-19 hospital admissions in 2020 (previous to the start of the vaccination rollout) (Appendix 2 p 4), the five Brazilian macroregions (North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South) and the Primary healthcare coverage. A pre-specified interaction term for the HDI level and the PHC coverage was included. Numerical covariates \u2013 population, distance to the State capital, and the GINI index - were modelled using restricted cubic splines or using the log transformation when applicable (Appendix 2 p 5). Marginal means were estimated to evaluate the interplay between HDI level and the PHC coverage using averages as the representative values for the other covariates (an \u201caverage municipality\u201d). Our main analysis was conducted in three parts. First, we analysed the daily progression of the COVID-19 pandemic burden (hospital admissions per 100,000 population) and the vaccination coverage. We calculated the vaccination coverage as the number of individuals with a least one dose (\"Partially vaccinated\") and those with two doses or a single dose (\"Fully vaccinated\") for the whole country and stratified per age group, state, and platform. The analysis was pre-specified, and the sample size was pragmatic. Data were described using medians and interquartile range (IQR) or means and standard deviations (SDs) for numeric variables and frequency and proportions for categorical variables. We performed the analysis considering complete data, and no missing value imputation was performed. We considered the municipality-level Human Development Index (HDI) as a surrogate measure of socioeconomic development (Appendix 2 p 3). The HDI is a well-established international metric for human development and wellbeing conditions, favouring comparative studies with other countries. In addition, it is available at the municipality level in Brazil, being used to guide local policies. The HDI is composed of three main aspects of a location's development: Education, Income and Longevity. We classified municipalities in three main levels of HDI, according to the terciles of its distribution - Low: HDI lower than the first tercile; Medium: HDI between the first and second terciles; High: HDI greater than the third tercile. Classifying the municipalities using the terciles resulted in more balanced groups compared to the traditional HDI strata, which is divided in five groups based on equally distance HDI ranges.(Appendix 2 p 3). Our primary outcome is the first dose vaccine coverage at the municipal level measured as the rate of first doses applied per 100 people standardised by age and sex. The standardisation used the Brazilian population as reference. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of people with at least one dose or fully vaccinated, hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths rates per 100,000 population, and the hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths rates per 1000 doses administered at the municipal level. All rates in the secondary outcomes were also standardised by age and sex. The Brazilian national immunisation program (PNI) launched the COVID-19 vaccination campaign on January 17, 2021. The PNI distributed free doses of COVID-19 vaccines on a populational-basis to states and then to the municipalities that managed the local vaccination program in accordance with the available resources. The program followed a national age-based calendar during the whole period, with some local adaptions. It started in parallel vaccinating indigenous, healthcare workers and those aged 90+, then followed exclusively age-based calendar. By the end of April 2021, when almost all elderlies presented fully first dose coverage and the age allowed to vaccinate was 60\u201364 years, individuals with some comorbidities aged 55\u201359 years, and Down Syndrome, patients under chronic renal replacement therapy and pregnant women with any comorbidity, independent of age, were considered eligible for vaccination. Some other groups, such as those working on schools, also were prioritized later on, always in parallel with the age-based calendar. Four vaccine platforms were considered in the country: two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac, ChAdOx1-S\/nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), or BNT162b2 (Pfizer\/BioNTech); or Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) single-dose. We analysed all vaccination records from January 17, the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, to August 31, 2021, before the start of booster doses administration. To describe the progression of the vaccination program, we considered first, second and single doses administered within the study period. We included COVID-19 adult hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths data from the same analysis period. All data were already de-identified and publicly available. Following ethically agreed principles on open data, this analysis did not require ethical approval in Brazil. We obtained data on hospitalised adult (\u226520 years old) patients with COVID-19 registered in the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Vigil\u00e2ncia Epidemiol\u00f3gica da Gripe, SIVEP-Gripe).The SIVEP-Gripe is a nationwide surveillance database used to monitor severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in Brazil since 2009\u2032s H1N1 pandemic and currently is one of the main notification repositories for COVID-19. We analysed patient demographics (age, sex and place of residence), symptom onset, date of the outcome, and the outcome status (death or discharge). A detailed description of the SIVEP-Gripe dataset was provided elsewhere. Socioeconomic, demographic, and PHC of Brazilian municipalities was obtained from three public sources (Appendix 2 p 2). The Human Development Index (HDI) data were obtained from the 2010 Brazilian population census. We used PHC coverage data immediately before the pre-pandemic period (December\/2019). The PHC has the Family Health Strategy (FHS) as its national expansion policy.In this model, FHS teams provide healthcare services to 2000\u20134000 individuals across a geographic area. In 2019, 98% of the municipalities adopted the FHS model, 60\u00b70% of households were enrolled in the FHS, and the population coverage was 62\u00b76% corresponding to 131,201 million people.The PHC coverage is measured by a national, standardised metric used to distribute resources, guide the organization of primary care teams, and monitor evolution of primary care health infrastructure.It is expected that each \u201cfamily-health unit\u201d can attend, or cover, 3450 individuals in their catchment area. Hence, the metric corresponds to the proportion of the municipality population covered by the FHS and FHS-equivalent teams.Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health's e-Gestor Aten\u00e7\u00e3o B\u00e1sica database. Finally, we used 2020 Population estimates provided by the Health Surveillance Secretary from the Brazilian Ministry of Health stratified by age, sex, and municipality. We performed an ecological study to analyse COVID-19 immunisation data from the Brazilian National Immunization Program Information System (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o do Programa Nacional de Imuniza\u00e7\u00e3o [SI-PNI]). The SI-PNI is the main data repository of vaccine doses administered in Brazil. Each record contains information on the person's demographics (age, sex and place of residence), vaccine platform, dose, date of dose administration, place of administration. The HDI levels presented different monthly progressions and growths regarding the standardised first dose rates, COVID-19 hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths rates per 1000 doses ( Figure 4 ). From January to April 2021, the progression of the standardised first dose rates was similar among levels ( Figure 4 A). However, by August 2021, municipalities with low HDI presented a lower average first dose rate than those with medium or high HDI (78\u00b74 vs 87\u00b79 and 91\u00b72 standardised first doses rates per 100 people; Appendix 2 p 25). Furthermore, we evaluated the progression of standardised average hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths rates per 1000 doses. From January to August 2021, there were 1,080,422 hospital admissions and 349,350 in-hospital deaths in Brazil. Although these rates decreased throughout the period for all levels, low HDI municipalities presented a lower average reduction rate for in-hospital deaths per 1000 doses (\u221233\u00b74%%, 95%CI: \u221235\u00b72%, \u221231\u00b76%) compared to those with medium (-36\u00b76%, 95%CI: -38\u00b73%, -34\u00b79%) or high HDI (-39\u00b78%, 95%CI: -41\u00b74%, -38\u00b71%, p<0\u00b7001; Appendix 2 p 26). Progression of monthly rates of standardised vaccine first doses, hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths per 1000 doses administered per Human Development Index level. Values (y-axis) correspond to average age-and-sex-adjusted rates for all municipalities (N = 5565) and their respective 95% confidence intervals: (A) cumulative first doses per 100 people; (B) Hospital admissions per 1000 doses administered (month of symptoms onset); and (C) in-hospital deaths per 1000 (month of outcome). Figure 4 Progression of monthly rates of standardised vaccine first doses, hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths per 1000 doses administered per Human Development Index level. Values (y-axis) correspond to average age-and-sex-adjusted rates for all municipalities (N = 5565) and their respective 95% confidence intervals: (A) cumulative first doses per 100 people; (B) Hospital admissions per 1000 doses administered (month of symptoms onset); and (C) in-hospital deaths per 1000 (month of outcome). We used the negative binomial regression model to estimate the association between human development with the standardised first dose rates. Municipalities with medium (RR [95% CI]: 0\u00b794 [0\u00b793-0\u00b795]) or low (RR [95% CI]: 0\u00b787 [0\u00b785-0\u00b788]) HDI were associated with decreased rates compared to those with high HDI, considering the average PHC coverage (92\u00b77%), after adjusting by population, distance to capital and region (Appendix 2 pp 15-16). The interaction term represents the association of HDI level, and the vaccination rate is modified by PHC coverage. Municipalities from the low HDI group perform more similar to high HDI levels as the PHC coverage increases (a 2-percentage point increase in doses per each PHC coverage additional 10-percentage point). For instance, the adjusted predictions from marginal means ( Figure 3 , Appendix 2 pp 16-18) indicate that when PHC coverage was at 50%, the low and medium HDI levels presented approximately 19% and 5% less first doses (RR [95% CI]: 0\u00b781 [0\u00b778-0\u00b784] and 0\u00b795 [0\u00b792-0\u00b797], respectively), compared to the high HDI municipalities, respectively; however, those differences reduce when PHC coverage increases, e.g., at 100% coverage, there were 12% less first doses (RR [95% CI]: 0\u00b788 [0\u00b786-0\u00b789]) in low compared to the high HDI level. The main findings did not change in the three sensitivities analyses (Appendix 2 pp 19-24). First doses rates per 100 people according to Health Development Index (HDI) and Primary healthcare coverage estimated from marginal means. First doses rates per 100 people (y-axis) were estimated as marginal means for different Primary healthcare coverage stratified by Human Development Index (HDI) level and according to representative values of other covariates (\u201caverage municipality\u201d). Predictions were obtained from the negative binomial regression model.

Predictions were obtained from the negative binomial regression model. Low HDI municipalities had lower median standardised first dose coverage compared to those with medium and high HDI (63 [IQR: 55, 70] vs 68 [IQR: 61, 75] and 72 [IQR: 66, 79] doses per 100 people; Table 1 ). Municipalities with low and medium HDI had similar PHC coverage, higher than in high HDI locations (median 95% [IQR: 63%, 100%]). Low HDI municipalities were mainly located in the North and Northeast regions (1681\/1864, 90%) and the largest municipalities, mostly from the South and Southeast regions (1620\/1841, 88%), including all the State capitals, presented the highest HDIs ( Figure 2 , Appendix 2 pp 10-14). COVID-19 hospital admission and in-hospital death rates adjusted by age and sex were mostly concentrated in high HDI municipalities ( Table 1 ).

The progression of first doses administration also differed in terms of platforms ( Figure 1 D). The vaccination started with the administration of Sinovac-CoronaVac and gradually increased in number of doses over the first three months. From March to April 2021, the pace of first dose administration decelerated, with a higher presence of ChAdOx1-S\/nCoV-19 compared to Sinovac-CoronaVac. Later, the progression of first doses resumed, with a higher administration of BNT162b2 doses. Ad26.COV2.S doses were less expressive than in June and July 2021 compared to other platforms. In August 2021, approximately 31\u00b77 million doses were administered, of which 62% from BNT162b2 and 28% were from Sinovac-CoronaVac (Appendix 2 p 8). We display an overview of the immunisation program and the pandemic progression in Brazil in Figure 1 . The overall first doses coverage was 64\u00b72% and second or single doses coverage was 31\u00b74% by the end of Aug 2021 ( Figure 1 A). The proportion of adults (\u226520 years old) with at least one dose was 85% (129,540,717\/151,778,738). Most elders were already fully vaccinated (all age strata over 60 years old with a second dose coverage >=90%, Figure 1 B, Appendix 2 p 9). The administration of doses differed geographically ( Figure 1 C, Appendix 2 p 9): Northern states presented the lower standardised first dose rates (Par\u00e1 = 54\u00b79 doses per 100 people), compared to higher rates in the Southern states (S\u00e3o Paulo = 73\u00b70 doses per 100 people).

Reference dates are February 15, 2021, for Gamma variant dominant, and July 01, 2021, for delta variant dominance. The number of vaccine doses for COVID-19 administered, reported by the Brazilian Immunisation program, between January 17, 2021, and August 31, 2021, reached 203,492,355 doses. After removing records with unidentified information on the city of residence and considering only first, second and single doses, 202,427,355 doses remained. Out of these, 135,921,791 (67%) doses corresponded to first, 61,668,575 (30%) to second and 4,836,989 (3%) to single doses (Appendix 2 p 7). Four distinct vaccine platforms were used in the country, ChAdOx1-S\/nCoV-19, Sinovac-CoronaVac, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), composing 44\u00b78%, 33\u00b72%, 19\u00b76%, and 2\u00b74% of total doses, respectively (Appendix 2 p 8). Discussion We analysed the COVID-19 vaccination coverage progression in all 5570 Brazilian municipalities throughout the first seven months of the national vaccination campaign. At the end of this period, more than 200 million doses were administered, but vaccination coverage differed across the country. Municipalities with low HDI were associated with decreased first dose coverage and presented a slower progression in pandemic control than highly developed locations. Furthermore, in municipalities with low HDI, the primary care coverage was associated with an increased first dose coverage. 22 Barry V Dasgupta S Weller DL et al.

Socioeconomic gradient in COVID-19 vaccination: evidence from Israel. A few studies have analysed national data to determine social and economic factors related to differences in vaccine coverage.These studies are limited to high-income countries or specific age groups. However, those analyses would be essential in low-income countries, where socioeconomic differences are expected to be more significant. Our study was the first to analyse the dynamics and inequity of vaccine coverage using nationwide data from a large LMIC. HDI was used as a surrogate measure of social vulnerability and poverty, an internationally accepted and comparable metric, and available for all Brazilian municipalities. National vaccination data were analysed dynamically and adjusted by age and sex for each municipality throughout the study period. Modelling the association of human development and vaccination coverage, we identified that municipalities with low development were associated with lower vaccination coverage after seven months compared to highly developed locations, after adjusting for population size, distance to State capitals, and region. Those differences were also observed dynamically, in which municipalities with low development presented a lower monthly coverage rate growth than highly developed locations. 26 Stojanovic J Boucher VG Gagne M et al.

COVID-19 vaccination challenge: what have we learned from the Brazilian process?. One potential factor in explaining the observed difference across HDI is the logistic of dose distribution to the municipalities. The National authority centralised the distribution of vaccine doses to the states and then to the municipalities. The differences in vaccine coverage remained after adjusting for the distance to state capitals, which were the main entrance hubs of vaccine doses. Another potential factor for low vaccination coverage is vaccine hesitancy, a significant factor in high-income countries,particularly for a more vulnerable population. In Brazil, there was a large concern regarding a potential impact of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy leveraged by the country's leadership and political polarity.However, surveys conducted previous to the COVID-19 vaccination program start showed a high willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil,similar as described in other LMIC.Additionally, we observed a high average vaccination coverage in the country with low hesitancy. 16 Rasella D Harhay MO Pamponet ML Aquino R Barreto ML. Impact of primary health care on mortality from heart and cerebrovascular diseases in Brazil: a nationwide analysis of longitudinal data. Another factor to explain differences among municipalities are the role of primary health care teams on the management and administration of vaccine doses. For instance, the PNI demands PHC units to have vaccination rooms and supports the access to equipment and trained personnel for vaccine administration, including a cold-chain that is important to manage new vaccine platform technologies, such as the BNT162b2 (Pfizer\/BioNTech). The PHC coverage metric used in this study is based on the catchment area of FHS teams, thus representing the coverage from a theoretical demand of a population within a municipality. Thus, we cannot ascertain directly the access and engagement of the population, nor performance of PHC services. Nevertheless, increased PHC coverage has been associated with better health outcomes in several domains.Here, it was associated with higher vaccination coverage in low HDI municipalities, suggesting that investments in primary health care might support for a better structure and organisation of the vaccination program, guaranteeing equitable access to vaccines by vulnerable populations and effective control of the pandemic. 19 Bastos LS Ranzani OT Souza TML Hamacher S Bozza FA. COVID-19 hospital admissions: Brazil's first and second waves compared. The vaccination campaign progression was not steady over the first seven months. Although there was a slow increase in vaccine coverage in the first three months, there was a deacceleration in vaccine administration between March and April 2021. The shortage of inputs and supplies for vaccines impacted the production of new doses of Sinovac\u2013CoronaVac and ChAdOx1-S\/nCoV-19, the main platforms used in the country at this period and produced by the Butatan Institute and FIOCRUZ. The vaccine campaign regained momentum with the arrival of BNT162b2 doses after May 2021. From this moment, the administration of doses began to differ between locations, potentially indicating logistic challenges from the handling of this vaccine platform. Therefore, low HDI municipalities showed lower vaccination rates compared to higher HDI from May to August 2021. To understand the challenges in the start of the vaccination rollout during the pandemic, we restricted the analysis to the initial phase, when the system was under high pressure to vaccinate the maximum of individuals in a short time aiming to reduce the burden of disease and the impacts in mortality for the Brazilian population. Additionally, we observed that hospital admission and in-hospital deaths rates adjusted by doses decreased over the seven months. Low HDI municipalities showed a slower decrease in in-hospital death rates compared to higher developed locations. However, the interpretation should be cautious. Due to the ecological design, we cannot infer that the reduction in COVID-19 hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths is only due to the vaccination. In addition, we analysed the vaccination rates at municipal level, and to estimate the direct impact of the vaccination program on the control of the pandemic requires additional information (e.g., the follow-up vaccinated people, testing data, the vaccine platform used, different doses and time from vaccination) and specific study designs, such as a counterfactual analysis. 32 Rocha R Atun R Massuda A et al. Effect of socioeconomic inequalities and vulnerabilities on health-system preparedness and response to COVID-19 in Brazil: a comprehensive analysis. The findings of this study have to be interpreted in light of some additional limitations. First, this is an ecological analysis and we cannot translate these findings directly to the individuals in each one of the municipalities. We aggregated the data at the municipal level, so did not consider inequities within each municipality; even in high HDI locations, vulnerable populations might have difficulties accessing vaccination. Second, the process of notifying vaccine doses, hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths may be different among municipalities. For instance, low-resource locations may have higher delays or issues in releasing data in the systems compared to more developed municipalities. However, we exported the data on January 14, 2022, which minimised any potential delay from data from August 2021.Third, the proportion of priority groups for the vaccination schedule at municipal level might be correlated with HDI, which could led to over- or under-estimation of the association between vaccination efficiency and HDI. However, the Brazilian program in the study period was mainly based on age, and our sensitivity analysed yielded comparable results. Finally, we have no data on the supply of doses at the municipal level, nor additional local strategies for vaccination, such as the use mobile units, adapted places for vaccination beyond the PHC structure, such as churches and sports clubs, and active vaccination programs during weekends, additional efforts that some municipalities organised during 2021 in Brazil. Our finding indicates that low socioeconomic development was associated with decreased first dose vaccination rates in Brazil, a large LMIC with significant inequality. Additionally, it reinforces the power of the universal healthcare coverage, with the presence of primary health care in vulnerable communities and cost-free vaccination, as a major component guaranteeing equitable access to vaccines by vulnerable populations and effective control of the pandemic.",

        "text":"During the past 15 years allergic reactions to latex have become a significant public health problem, particularly among health-care workers. Approximately 800,000 American adults and children have become allergic to natural rubber latex, found in gloves and pacifiers. When exposed to latex or latex dust, sensitized persons can develop hives, nasal and eye irritation, asthma, and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition in which the breathing passageways swell closed. About 1% of the general public and 4.5% to 17% of health-care workers and others exposed to latex on their jobs have become sensitized. Some have even been forced to terminate their careers for this reason. Medical and dental procedures on sensitized individuals may be complicated by anaphylactic events, as may the use of latex pacifiers by infants. The FDA has received more than 2000 reports of injury and several reports of death associated with latex allergy. In 1996, the agency published regulations that would require all latex-containing gloves and other devices to be labeled accordingly, including warnings about possible allergic reactions. Latex is a common component of disposable gloves, intravenous tubing, syringes, stethoscopes, catheters, dressings, bandages, and other medical supplies. Among health-care workers, gloves are the most significant source because they are frequently used, and the powder used to line some of them can absorb latex proteins and become airborne. Asthmatic reactions have occurred among people who did not use gloves but merely inhaled latex-containing dust. Thus, sensitive workers can be affected not only by their own gloves but also by those worn by co-workers. The surge of latex allergy among health-care workers is primarily attributable to greater use of disposable gloves to prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis B. Increased demand and cost pressures for gloves has led some manufacturers to shorten the manufacturing time by reducing the number of washing and purifying steps, which increases the amount of sensitizing protein that the gloves will transmit. The American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has published guidelines and recommends that people who have been diagnosed as allergic wear an identification card (or bracelet) and a self-injectable adrenalin device. Sensitive individuals should be sure that their health-care providers are aware of their condition so that they are not exposed to latex during medical procedures or surgery. A few states have introduced bills to ban the use of powdered latex gloves in medical facilities. For Further Information",

        "text":"There certainly must exist an old English proverb warning, \u201cHe who carries coals to Newcastle runs grave risk of being burned.\u201d I must admit that I have felt uncomfortably warm of late in contemplating my presentation before this seminar, in which laetrile should constitute a principal ingredient of my remarks. Some of you have devoted weeks of your lives to concern over this unorthodox cancer treatment and have played major roles in helping the Commissioner prepare his decision on laetrile\u2019s status at the end of the rulemaking procedure called for by the 10th Circuit Court. This decision, published in the Federal Register on August 5, 1977 seems to me the most thorough, broad-gauged, and insightful analysis of a highly touted but ineffective product, the mode of its promotion, and the psychology of its acceptance that I have ever read. What then, in the company of you experts, can I say that will not seem oppressively like res adjudicata or d\u00e9ja vu? So as to gain what I hope may be a fresh perspective, let me try to differentiate between what might be called endemic and epidemic quackery, essaying some historical epidemiology to point to factors present when epidemics occur. Endemic quackery has existed in the world, to quote Voltaire, since the first knave met the first fool. As long as some diseases remain unconquered and death marks the certain terminus of our earthly pilgrimage, and as long as an ethical medical profession abstains from promising the impossible, the unscrupulous will boldly cater to our often desperate hopes. Therefore, a certain basic level of quackery, I take for granted, has existed in all places and at all times and is destined to continue. Occasionally, as one scans the past, he can detect an outburst of quackish energy that I should like to designate as an epidemic. Sometimes a single promotion achieves such a status. At other times the epidemic level consists of a congeries of separate ventures. Before getting to laetrile, let me discuss briefly one epidemic promotion and one epidemic period from the American past. In 1796, 180 years before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the federal government took perhaps its initial action regarding a medical device. In that year the government granted the first patent issued under the Consti\u00adtution in the area of health to a Connecticut physician for \u201cImproving Pain, Etc., by Metallic Points.\u201d Elisha Perkins\u2019 famous \u201ctractors\u201d furnished the new nation\u2019s first example of a health quackery epidemic. Always in such single-promotion epidemics, it seems to me, an ingenious promoter, or group of promoters, shrewdly devises and\/or luckily falls upon an approach that meshes with remarkable pertinence into key elements of the prevailing social climate. In Perkins\u2019 case these elements were fascination with electricity and cultural nationalism. A small-town country doctor probably trained by apprenticeship to his father, Perkins discovered that he could ease pains in various parts of his patients\u2019 bodies by drawing the blade of his penknife across the skin above the hurting parts and that he could relieve headaches by the ministration of a lacquered iron comb. He also observed that sometimes muscles contracted suddenly when touched during surgery by his knife. Knowing about Franklin and Mesmer, reading an account of Galvani\u2019s experiments, Perkins did what many would-be innovators before and since have done, he compressed what he had heard and observed into a simple theory. Almost all painful conditions, he concluded, especially gout, pleurisy, rheumatism, violent insanity, \u201cinflammatory tumors,\u201d and yellow fever, resulted from a surcharge of an electric fluid that accumulated in the bodily parts. This could be released by drawing a metal point across the afflicted surface, always moving from the center toward the extremities, thus ending pain and working a cure. Asserting in his letters the necessity and propriety of making money from his discovery- Perkins bad a family of ten children to support\u2013, this Yankee from the Nutmeg state shifted his therapeutic instrument from simple knife and comb to specially fabricated devices, a pair of small pointed metal \u201ctractors,\u201d called so because they pulled out pain. Made in a furnace in Perkins\u2019 home, the two tractors were composed of secret alloys, one gold in color, the other silver. In time, forgetting the knife and comb, Perkins insisted that only his patented points would work. Perhaps he became genuinely persuaded such was the case. In the history of quackery many schemers have become converts to the gospel of their own oratory. Perkins sold his tractors for $25 a pair, in his day a princely sum. Electricity was much in the air in the 18th century, and to posit an electrical cause for most diseases and a sort of miniature lightning rod cure struck the popular mind as both exciting and plausible. At least one testimonial, from a leading figure in the American Philosophical Society, compared Perkins\u2019 achievement favorably with Franklin\u2019s famous experiment and disparaged critics of Perkinism as similar to the English philosophers who had attacked the Philadelphia sage. This linkage with Franklin underlined the proud fact that Perkins\u2019 pur\u00adported breakthrough was an American discovery. In the aftermath of a successful Revolution, cultural nationalism blazed brightly in the new nation. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and now the most distinguished physician in the land, argued that there existed in the United States twenty times more intellect and a hundred times more knowledge than there had been in the American colonies before the war. Could it not be, Perkins\u2019 champions queried jubilantly, that a nation which had provided the perfect example of freedom to the world might not also, through the metallic tractors, provide the means to universal health? Perkins\u2019 shrewd decision to get his tractors patented fit in neatly with this patriotic theme. In truth, patenting was still a very simple practice requiring no proof of an invention\u2019s utility, but a patent could easily appear to be a symbol of governmental backing, even the consummate testimonial to healing potency. Perkins took immediate steps to bolster this sentiment among potential customers. At the very time the state medical society in Connecticut was ousting him for having \u201cgleaned up\u201d his tractors \u201cfrom the miserable remains of animal magnetism,\u201d Perkins labored to find distinguished buyers in Philadelphia, the nation\u2019s capital. And he succeeded. Several members of the Congress acquired a pair. So did the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who wrote a letter praising the tractors to future Chief Justice Marshall. And a pair of the metallic points seems to have been bought by President Washington himself. With the three branches of the government thus leading the way, Americans engaged in a frenzy of \u201cgalvanizing trumpery.\u201d As these events demonstrate, Perkins had first-rank promotional talents. Prior to the tractors, he had added to his medical fees income secured from trading mules. His vigorous, magnetic personality certainly had much to do with both his therapeutic and his marketing successes. His series of testi\u00admonial pamphlets shows that Perkins worked as effectively in print as in face-\u00adto-face encounter. He gave tractors to some clergymen, along with a certificate saying they had bought them. And, despite their high cost, the metallic points sold well. An account suggests that people sold horses and carriages in order to buy them, and in one case a Southern plantation. Perkins countered the opposition of his erstwhile fellows in the Connecticut medical society as the unorthodox almost always do. He accused them of blind\u00adness and greed. And he pointed out that some physicians supported his discovery, despite \u201cmenaces\u201d from the stodgy establishment. Besides electrical wonder and cultural nationalism, a third factor in the climate of the 1790s may have aided Perkinism to reach epidemic proportions. This was fear of yellow fever. That dread disease appeared again and again during the decade, including devastating attacks on Northern cities. In the Philadelphia epidemic of 1793 Perkins himself had lost a daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren. So a special poignancy marks his inclusion of yellow fever among the ailments amenable to tractor treatment. And the surest proof that Perkins placed great faith in the efficacy of his patented points comes from his going to New York in 1799 when that city lay prostrate in the grip of yellow fever to treat the ill by plying his device. He could not save himself. He contracted the fever end died of it. Perkins\u2019 death ended the American boom. A British craze, perhaps even more frenetic, engineered by one of Perkins\u2019 sons, vanished when a provincial physician demonstrated that he could get just as enthusiastic patient response by using wooden tractors painted gold and silver as he could secure wielding the authentic patented points. Some writers, admitting Perkins\u2019 desire for money and his convenient forgetfulness about penknife and comb while later stressing that only the twenty-five dollar tractors possessed therapeutic efficacy, nonetheless wonder if it is appropriate to term him a quack. As his way of death demonstrates, they argue, he believed in his product, and therefore could not be a fraud. Does quackery require fraudulency? Does one \u201cknowingly\u201d have to sin or err in these matters to run afoul of the moral or statutory laws? Yes, said Congress in the 1912 Sherley Amendment. But I prefer But I prefer to stand with the 1938 law\u2019s negative, and even apply the principle retrospectively, granting some diffi\u00adculties as one moves backward in time and acknowledging, under this definition, that some \u201cquacks\u201d are more reprehensible than others. To pin down the term , social result as well as personal motive must be taken into account. To the patient-victim it makes no difference whether his self-asserted savior lies brazenly or speaks what he himself ignorantly believes to be the truth. The period I wish to point to in which no single promotion dominated but which saw the overall level of quackery reach epidemic proportions covers roughly the middle third of the 19th century. In many ways during these years the social fabric of the nation underwent fundamental change. Quacks and sectarians attuned to the new currents and maneuvering cleverly within their imperatives managed to flourish mightily. In its political dimension, the period began with Jacksonian democracy, which discredited an older elite leadership and broadened political power among the populace. In an intellectual sense during these years all branches of the educated establishment suffered widespread popular suspicion and scorn. \u201cThe priest, the doctor, and the lawyer,\u201d wrote an untutored New Englander, all stood convicted of \u201cdeceiving the people.\u201d Orthodox physicians learned nothing about the nature of medicine, he added, except \u201chow much poison . . . could be given without causing death.\u201d This jab at the heroic practice of the regulars had some pertinence~ and quacks were frequently to make it even while they themselves ladled out huge doses of opium and mercury. But it was the lofty status and established power of the educated which came espe\u00adcially under attack. The so-called state \u201cBla.ck Laws\u201d by rich orthodoxy sought to monopolize medical practice irked a growing breed of irregulars. \u201cWe go for free trade in doctoring,\u201d a Cincinnatian wrote in 1849; \u201cmedicine, like theology, should be divorced from the State, and . . . . as in the dif\u00adferent sects of religionists, the various medical systems . . . [should] be treated alike.\u201d Licensing laws were swept away, and Thomsonians, homeopaths, hydropaths, and almost anyone who wanted to could practice. The patent medicine side of quackery profited from other facets of burgeoning democracy, which expanded the newspaper press at the same time that it schooled more people to a level of literacy capable of reading the nostrum advertising which the new journals contained. In this atmosphere of freedom, as the common man increasingly made up his own mind about his health, he bought more patent medicines. The right of choice stimulates pride, fires ambition, but also provokes anxiety. Which of the many voices appealing for favor could best be believed? Hard, sharp, unscrupulous bargaining reigned in the realm of both thought and trade. Life became intensely competitive. Tricksters proliferated, and victimization was rampant. Everyone expected roguery, anticipated being cheated, himself sought to cheat in turn. Nor, within limits, did people mind being hoodwinked. They had made their own decisions, taken their chances in a free environment. Sometimes they were bound to lose. Indeed, clever imposture tended to amuse them. Such was the state of the popular mind as the sales of nostrums soared. This picture of the period emerges from Neil Harris\u2019 brilliant book on \u201cthe art of P. T. Barnum,\u201d titled Humbug. Coinciding with these complex aspects of freedom\u2019s ferment, the arrival of the romantic movement also helped quackery along. A romantic climate, Grete de Francesco has written, favors \u201call sorts of nature cures\u201d and \u201cthe development of a new kind of imposture: a falsification of Nature through overemphasis on the natural.\u201d All over America, as vell as in Europe, lay healers in rustic settings employed a variety of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, water being especially prominent. Among those bemoaning the increasing artificiality of life, a preoccupation began with the \u201cnatural\u201d diet. Not that critique of the normal diet was not deserved. But some sages went much further. Sylvester Graham plotted a dietary regimen that he hoped might restore the pristine conditions and the purity of life in the Garden of Eden. Graham\u2019s ideas influenced the doctrines of new religions, the prescriptions of unorthodox physicians, and the promotions of patent medicine vendors. Please do not get the idea that I am decrying democracy, freedom, and romanticism because they provided an environment in which clever promoters could manipulate such currents so as to produce an epidemic of quackery. It is Just my hope, of course, to use history to help reveal the dynamism of a perennial threat. So far I have spoken of pre-germ theory days when the yardstick of orthodoxy could not by the nature of things measure quackery with the precision of our own times. Therefore, it is a paradoxical phenomenon deserving our earnest scrutiny that probably the single quackery promotion receiving the largest amount of public attention in all our nation\u2019s history should be one of our own day. What mesh of elements from the social climate and maneuvers by its promoters explain the sensational epidemic of laetrile? Basic, of course, are both the facts and the image of cancer in our society. With the decline of contagious diseases as a cause of death, due to sanitation, vaccines, and chemotherapy, cancer has risen to second place in the mortality lists. The 1900 death rate from malignant neoplasms was 64 per 100,000 deaths, the 1969 rate 160. On the disease and death front then, cancer and its mortality, have moved more to the center of public attention. In light of chemo\u00adtherapeutic miracles, the public wonders uneasily, why can\u2019t there be such a miracle involving cancer? This sense of urgency transmits itself to the Congress which allocates more money which, in turn, increases preoccupation with the disease. Yet the image of cancer may be an even more important force for quackery than its factual circumstances. Heart deaths exceed cancer deaths, but no waves of unorthodox cardiovascular cure-alls have surfaced similar to those in the cancer field, although perhaps obesity remedies may contain an element of this. All diseases possess a popular image. A sports columnist wrote recently that, as a boy, O J. Simpson suffered from rickets, which made him bow-legged and pigeon-toed and forced him to wear his shoes on the wrong feet. In college O.J. told his friends that he had been attacked by polio, because he considered polio a much classier disease than rickets. Through most of history the big killers have been pneumonias and gastro\u00adintestinal disorders, taken for granted by the populace because so common and familiar. What brought panic were diseases that caused less loss of life overall, but killed swiftly and painfully when they did come in epidemics, diseases possessing horrible external lesions, like smallpox, cholera, and the yellow fever which Elisha Perkins sought to cure. The fear of leprosy also greatly exceeded its morbidity. Syphilis, in English Restoration drama, was a subject of stock humor: the saddle nose, the falling hair, the aching bones brought gales of laughter from the audience as characteristics of the combatant who had lost in Venus\u2019 wars. In the romantic 19th century, syphilis ceased to be a hilarious disease and became a moral cataclysm. Under the romantic impact, tuberculosis gained the distinction of being the ennobling way to die. Lesions were hidden inside the body. As the consumptive wasted away, his mind was said to become more ethereal and spiritual as he gradually ascended toward his heavenly reward. Nor was this vision a male prerogative: recall the heroines of all these tragic operas.Indeed, for both men and women, a sort of tubercular standard of beauty came to prevail. If one could not achieve the proper paleness, frailness, and slenderness by contracting the disease, diet might lead to the desired result. Published beauty counsel suggested banning butter, cream, milk, cheese, fish, and vegetables. Sometimes small doses of arsenic were prescribed. These examples illustrate how the image of a disease can have a powerful influence on conduct. [After drafting this paper I was intrugued to find a more elaborate discussion of the disease theme in the current (January 26) issue of the New York Review of Books. I direct your attention to Susan Sontag\u2019s most perceptive analysis called Illness as Metaphor] That centuries ago cancer began to acquire a hostile and terrifying image may be deduced from the fact that the word \u201ccancer\u201d itself derives from the Greek word for crab. The crawling spread of cancer, gradual but relentless, whether exteroal and observable or internal and secretive, through the centuries appeared to be, and indeed a.mounted to, a sentence of death. This image hangs on, a powerful force in men\u2019s minds, a force not adequately updated by the victories orthodoxy increasingly has won. No doubt orthodoxy\u2019s message, ever more encouraging but never completely reassuring, cannot hope to compete with the frenzied fear, deeply embedded in the folk tradition and constantly revivified by the camp meeting oratory of orthodoxy\u2019s opponents. Here is Harry Hoxsey writing two decades ago on page 1 of his book entitled You Don\u2019t Have to Die: \u201cSuppose you suddenly discovered that you have cancer. A horrible crab-like disease has invaded your body, is gnawing your flesh, has pushed greedy tentacles into your vital organs. A loathsome scavenger slowly and inexorably is consuming you alive, cell by cell.\u201d And, of course, the unorthodox make orthodox weapons against the disease seem as terrifying as the disease itself. It was a laetrile champion who recently spoke scornfully of regular medicine\u2019s \u201ccutting, burning, and poisoning.\u201d The assertiveness of the cancer theme among the varieties of quackery available preceded the laetrile epidemic. In recent years, as Wallace Janssen has so vividly pointed out in FDA Consumer, the names of Koch and Hoxsey and the brand name Krebiozen have achieved high public recognition. Besides cancer\u2019s image as an element of popular culture helping explain the laetrile boom, other facets of the broad climate are involved. The whole trend of 20th century thought, for example, has brought us to new and gloomy versions of romanticism. As our century opened, the prevailing mood was cheerful and so hopeful about the future that progress seemed inevitable. Science had much to do with this, having revealed a comfortable, homey universe working by natural laws. The methods of science seemed transferable to the study of social situations, offering the prospect of resolving society\u2019s strains. Morality was palpable; people discussed all questions in moral terms with nary a blush. Americans as openly esteemed patriotism as morality, antici\u00adpating a great future destiny for the nation. Leaders were generally esteemed. Goodness marked basic human nature, and man\u2019s transgressions resulted not from evil but from error. Education would eliminate error, as technology would banish poverty. One seer welcomed the new century by taking material progress for granted, then adding: \u201cLaws are becoming more just, rulers humane; music is becoming sweeter and books wiser; homes are happier, and the individual heart becoming at once more just and more gentle.\u201d Things did not continue quite along this line. Relativity and indeter\u00adminacy replaced certainty in science, and the fixity of other 19th century solids also dissolved, including morality. Inevitable progress fell under the impact of a series of terrible wars. The inherent goodness of human nature, battered by new schools of philosophy, crumbled under the revelations from the German concentration camps. The belief in education as a social panacea withered. Science-technology inventiveness did continue to produce wondrous products for mankind\u2019s benefit, but also devised nuclear weapons and polluted the atmosphere. A kind of confident, reasonable, cheerful 19th century syn\u00adthesis gradually came apart, as the 13th century Thomistic synthesis broke up in the 14th century. At this juncture we cannot detect a new Renaissance that might re-establish a common confidence and faith. Rather the omens are disheartening. A whole host of new religions have sprung up seeking to win the adherence of distraught humankind. As in the 14th century, some of them seem diabolical. Since modern urban industrial civilization strikes many people as part of the problem, some disturbed souls strive to return to nature. Pressing upon this long developing major crisis of belief came Vietnam,. an unpopular, unsuccessful var that put generations at each other\u2019s throats, and Watergate, a seeming indisputable proof of what some voices had long been crying, that blame for discontents could be laid upon leadership. In my bones, I feel sure that such a setting as I have quickly sketched provides an atmosphere for the flourishing of quackery. Those questing for new faith are terribly vulnerable to false prophets. The widespread distrust of established authorities encompasses those who traditionally have sought to protect the public from charlatanry. The medical profession su1\u2019fers sus\u00adpicion, including the specialists within it concerned with cancer. In the behavioral survey of health practices and opinions sponsored by the FDA and six other federal agencies and released five years ago, it was concluded that 42% of American adults would not be persuaded by almost unanimous expert opinion that a purported \u201ccancer cure\u201d held out false hope. And, of course, distrust of authority also encompasses regulatory agencies. The major explanation for the epidemic proportions achieved by laetrile, it seems to me, lies in the shrewdness with which its proponents have recog\u00adnized these factors I have been discussing in the cultural environment and the skill with which they have exploited them. Misused authority constitutes oppression, and the opposite of oppression is freedom. If, in these parlous times, you can sell a panicked cancer sufferer and his family on the concept, not only that you have a treatment that will do some good, but also, that in accepting the treatment they are taking, in a confused immoral world, a nobly moral stand for an ancient and patriotic virtue, are joining a crusade for freedom itself, If you can do this, I say you are in business. The pitch may even seem persuasive to state legislators and federal judges. A radical right-wing reaction to our time of troubles, a movement opposing the initiatives of modern government, seems to be. a growing phenomenon. The adherence of such true believers to the ranks of laetrile promoters has unquestionably helped the movement grow. Some leaders of the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy may have profited from the marketing of laetrile as part of their motivation, but there exists unquestionably a massive component of the zeal of the doctrinaire. Frank Salaman, one of the founders of the group, sees \u201cat stake\u201d a \u201cstrong principle of human freedom from uncon\u00adstitutional interference.\u201d And the pro-laetrile film strip \u201cWorld without Cancer\u201d opened with the deceptively disarming words, \u201cWe are not prescribing any course of treatment. We endorse nothing but freedom of choice.\u201d Freedom of access to worthless cancer treatments, as I wrote in my affi\u00addavit submitted to the rulemaking proceeding, \u201cleads only [backward] toward the license of those ancient days, when \u2018the toadstool millionaires,\u2019 preaching religion and spouting patriotism, operating without restraint, fleeced and often killed their gullible victims. That is a fate from which seven decades of constructive legislation, beginning . . . [in] 1906, has somewhat rescued the nation. Complex, modern, industrial, urbanized society, with standards of medical judgment far more precise than those existing in the 19th century, cannot afford to let the nation\u2019s health be governed by a distorted definition of that great symbol, \u2018freedom,\u2019 which would return piratical anarchy to the realm of health.\u201d Legalizing laetrile, I fear, would breach the dike of the new drug efficacy provisions of the 1962 law in a most ominous way. An additional major force lofting laetrile to epidemic proportions, it seems to me, is another kind of alliance formed by its promoters. I don\u2019t know how firm structural links may be, but in developing political action procedures laetrile\u2019s champions have sat at the feet of the health food lobby. And, of course, whatever its earlier purported modes of biochemical functioning, laetrile finally became\u00b7 transmuted into a vitamin. In testifying last July before Senator Kennedy\u2019s Subcommittee on Health, Ernst Krebs, Jr. called laetrile \u201ca scientific revolution as profound as the germ theory of disease . . . [and] the Copernican theory.\u201d What Vitamin C is to scurvy, niacin to pellagra, and Vitamin D to rickets, he suggested, Vitamin B-17 is to cancer. If every American took laetrile regularly, Dr. John Richardson told the same hearing,\u201d in 20 years cancer would be relegated to the dusty pages of history.\u201d Converting laetrile into a vitamin must have seemed like a master stroke. Not only would it put the product under the food rather than the drug provisions of the national law, it would also broaden the market by giving a more plausible explanation for preventive therapy. Moreover, in light of folk attitudes, it would wrap the product in a glamorous cloak. For the word \u201cvitamin,\u201d for reasons both sound and illegitimate, holds high esteem. The survey of health practices and opinions, already referred to, revealed that three out of four .Americans cherish the magical belief that, no matter how sufficient their diets, taking extra vitamins automatically provides more energy and pep. This myth of superhealth from vitamins stands ready to piggyback other health claims. The survey revealed another telling point. Whereas in most aspects of self-treatment, no coherent body of theory underlies consumer action, which is motivated by what the study called \u201crampant empiricism,\u201d in the vitamin and health food area a different set of circumstances prevails. Here alone something like an organized rationale underlies conduct, one based on the premise that the normal food supply, because of inadequacies and introduced poisons, threatens health rather than promoting it, requiring supplements to save the day. This myth has been the deliberate and successful creation of the health food industry, especially since enactment of the 1938 law, fabri\u00adcated out of food folklore running back to the dawn age of man, of clever leger\u00addemain involving complex scientific nutrition, and of some true and scary episodes relating to standard foods. Linking in to the power of this myth could only aid in laetrile\u2019s popular acceptance. The health food leaders have excelled at employing the modern mass media to disseminate their nutritional fairy tales. \u201cIn effect,\u201d as Stephen Barrett has put it, \u201cthe media have become the label,\u201d but a label so detached from the packaging as seldom to be actionable. Promoters of dubious nutritional wares have also proved to be amazingly skillful at mobilizing those whom they had converted into a powerful political force. The Vitamin Amendments of 1976 attest to this skill. In their efforts to thwart the FDA\u2019s regulatory goals, even to reduce the agency\u2019s statutory power, the health food industry pioneered in waving the flag of freedom against bureaucratic oppression. Their literature appealed to Washington and Lincoln, asserting \u201cThey Too Fought for Freedom Against Great Odds. \u201cSurely these vitamin freedom shouters furnished an example in doctrine for those proclaiming the riskier freedom of treating cancer with the specious vitamin B-17. Pseudo-nutritionists have also shown laetrile leaders how to turn converts to their therapeutic doctrines into political shock troops. Evidences exist of cooperative interaction between the National Health Federation, one of the health food industry\u2019s major pressure groups, and laetrile\u2019s supporters. At NHF conventions, pro-laetrile movies have been shown. An NHF governor has edited pamphlets espousing laetrile, and the president of one of the laetrile sponsoring organizations, the Cancer Control Council, has served on the NHF governing board. The NHF Bulletin has boosted laetrile. So it is not surprising that their respective patterns of drum beating, in\u00adcluding political lobbying, should resemble each other. In a democracy, of course, representative bodies chosen by the electorate make the rules, including those relating to highly complex scientific matters. I am an admirer of William Lowrance\u2019s book entitled Of Acceptable Risk, Science and the Determination of Safety, the result of an inquiry by the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In essence, he concludes that in making public policy regarding matters of potential danger to society, the assessment of hazard is a scientific decision made by the experts, whereas the determination of risk is a political decision made by elected officials. Public opinion supported the enactment of food and drug laws, and those laws sought to remove from day-in, day-out legislative deter\u00admination highly complex particular questions, giving such decisions to expert agencies with rules of procedure defined in the laws. For legislatures to abandon this established tradition and rule on issues ad hoc seems to me highly unwise social policy, although of course legislatures possess the inherent power to do so. It is an indication of the epidemic levels of nutritional and cancer quackery that, in the federal and state areas respectively, enough pressure has been generated to cut back on the established pattern as well as on the rigor of regulation. Sometimes, in short, when shrewdly propagandized, a major segment of public opinion can be led to support a stand contrary to the conclusions of reputable scientists. And the issue may become emotional enough to make an impact on legislative bodies. \u201cCongress will rely on science when it can,\u201d the counsel for the House Health Subcommittee said recently, but in order for scientists to persuade legislators, they must convince the American people. This means a battle for minds, and for wills too, the will to let legis\u00adlators know convictions held. Champions of the unorthodox, for reasons I have sought to explain, bubble over with aggressive zeal. Opponents of the unorthodox on scientific grounds often act with greater diffidence. And when they do act, to many people they only confirm the distrust in which they already are held. Medical societies have not waged such effective battles against quackery recently as earlier in the century; indeed, the American Medical Association disbanded its anti-quackery machinery. Few local groups have demonstrated the vigor and imagination of Stephen Barrett\u2019s Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, among whose anti-quackery ventures the preparation of an excellent book, The Health Robbers, aimed at a broad readership, ranks high in public service. The American Cancer Society has striven to alert the public to the dangers of unproven methods. With respect to laetrile, the Food and Drug Administration has assumed the role of primary educator to the nation, in connection with the agency\u2019s legal actions and in a more general sense as well. In testimony before legislative committees, press releases, the pages of FDA Consumer, legal briefs, and a widely distributed poster, the FDA has striven to alert the public to laetrile\u2019s dangers. In the perspective of history, I trust the agency will receive for this service the credit it deserves. In light of what I have said earlier about our intellectual environment, I believe all foes of quackery have reason to remain alert. A recent student of Elisha Perkins\u2019 career, Jacques Quen, points to the fact that Perkins\u2019 physician critics, in condemning him, did not pose for themselves a further question. Why did the metallic tractors evoke such a satisfied, indeed ecstatic response from those who used them for their pains? Now, 180 years later, a much better understanding prevails of the placebo effect. And the Commissioner\u2019s report contains some intriguing efforts to explain the motivation of laetrile\u2019s users and proselytizers. Yet do we know enough? Is this not a field requiring more research? Would there not be value in seeking to balance Dr. Richardson\u2019s Laetrile Case Histories with another set, revealing not only the physiological circumstances, but as fully as might be, the psychological parameters of laetrile users, not only including the disillusioned, but the most buoyant of champions? Difficult as this task might be, I believe the results might prove to be useful on both the educational and the regulatory fronts against threats from other quackery epidemics in the years ahead. James Harvey Young (1915-2006), a professor of history at Emory University, was a social historian whose special interest was the development of food and drug regulation in America. He was a member of the FDA National Advisory Food and Drug Council. His books, The Toadstool Millionaires, The Medical Messiahs, and American Health Quackery, trace the history of quackery in America and efforts to control it. This paper was presented at an FDA Bureau of Drugs seminar in Rockville, Maryland, on January 17, 1978.",

Walensky, MD, MPH, was critical of the agency\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and announced internal changes aimed at improving how it operates. \u201cSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific challenges and the lack of regular, clear communications and consistent methods for sharing information impacted our ability to consistently meet the evolving public health threat,\u201d Walensky said in an email to CDC staff Wednesday morning. In a statement, the CDC said a review initiated earlier this year found that \u201ctraditional scientific and communication processes were not adequate to effectively respond to a crisis the size and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d and that the country\u2019s public health capabilities were \u201cwoefully under-resourced\u201d before the pandemic. \u201cWe undoubtedly have a frail public health infrastructure within the agency, and around the country, to tackle what we confronted,\u201d the CDC said. It said Walensky\u2019s changes will create \u201ca new, public health action-oriented culture at CDC that emphasizes accountability, collaboration, communication, and timeliness.\u201d \u2018Our big moment\u2019 The CDC has faced criticism for its response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the last two directors, and for the last several months has been confronted with another public health emergency, the expanding monkeypox outbreak. In her email, Walensky said the agency has \u201cnever ... had to make decisions so quickly, based on limited and evolving science.\u201d \u201cFor 75 years, CDC and public health have been preparing for COVID-19, and in our big moment, our performance did not reliably meet expectations,\u201d she said in a separate statement. \u201cAs a long-time admirer of this agency and a champion for public health, I want us all to do better, and it starts with CDC leading the way.\u201d In her email, Walensky said the review she initiated in April was meant to understand how the agency can \u201cpivot\u201d from long-standing practices and adapt during emergencies. The review included an analysis of CDC workflows \u201cwith a particular focus on how we swiftly move from science and program to policy, so that we can promptly operationalize guidance for the public.\u201d \u2018Cultural shift\u2019 Among the changes announced in her email, Walensky said the CDC \u2014 which often publishes emerging COVID-19 research in MMWR \u2014 should share scientific findings and data faster and translate them so that they are easier to understand and act on. She said the agency also needs to strengthen the workforce that is trained to respond to emergencies. \u201cAs we move forward, these changes will require a cultural shift,\u201d Walensky said in the email. \u201cUltimately, the institutional culture of the agency will need to evolve to reflect these new priorities and how we operate with a focus on serving the public through timely action and impact,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese solutions are intended to ensure CDC\u2019s programs and science reach the public in a timely, understandable, accessible, and implementable manner.\u201d Walensky announced the creation of a new equity office and said the CDC\u2019s Office of Laboratory Science and Office of Science will now report directly to her.

        "text":"A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts. Most people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later. But even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations. \"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. More COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science How Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19 Fighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease Disgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working? How the immune system remembers COVID-19 There are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time. New research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease. \"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\" In a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die. Image Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article. While the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. \"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past. \"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. \"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature If it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. \"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. COVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. \"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. \"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",

        "text":"Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic. Joel Shurkin, Contributor (Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe. The Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S. Italy\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone. In a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum. The pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy. Italians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified. About three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region. As of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died. In mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone. Ventilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques. In one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing. Fifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment. The use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die. Triage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited. What the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention. \u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d One way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines. The allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better. In American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan. Researchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision. Who is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician. These kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world. Yet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel. American doctors will likely face the same agonizing choices that have been necessary in other countries facing the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of educational webinars with residents, medical students, staff, ICU directors,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going on everywhere around the country. I know many hospitals are scrambling to put together policies and committees. I think we're a little ahead of the game at NYU, partly because we\u2019re a hospital of last resort. \u201cI don\u2019t think any hospital is fully prepared. I think planning was just inadequate.\u201d Spain is now catching up to Italy with cases. \u201cAnd so,\" Cereda said, \u201care we.\u201d",

Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later. But even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations. \"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. More COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science How Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19 Fighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease Disgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working? How the immune system remembers COVID-19 There are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time. New research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease. \"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\" In a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.

In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article. While the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. \"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past. \"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. \"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature If it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. \"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. COVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. \"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. \"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",

        "text":"The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past. A German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system. Next week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic. Discovering antibodies Emil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin. Von Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production. \"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908. Image Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory. Media credits The Wellcome Collection Media rights CC BY 4.0 Von Behring and Ehrlich's anti-diphtheria serum, known as diphtheria antitoxin, is essentially the same idea as the convalescent plasma being explored as a treatment for Covid-19. The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans. \"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization. While diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand. After developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies. Von Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19. Antibodies as tools Antibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body. But many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products. C\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984. \"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.) Many new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals. Researchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways. Killer T cells While antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells. Viruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target. \"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\" Image A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0 By the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty. With colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body. When a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells. Doherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19. \"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\" Most vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place. But respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems. If a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms. There is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses. There are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat. \"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\"",

        "text":"Vaccine authorization Vaccine authorization What processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness? Any vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy: COVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF) The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues. The American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process. What information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"? Data and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA. Data to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following: Chemistry, manufacturing and controls information Nonclinical data and information Clinical data and information Administrative and regulatory information How does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take? The FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA. Are mRNA vaccines safe? mRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. There are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. More information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC. Vaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution How will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)? Initial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers. Tribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service. How can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution? The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. When will vaccine be distributed to physician offices? In April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step. Vaccine administration Vaccine administration What do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines? To receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll. What vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of? COVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage). COVID-19 vaccine providers are required to: Store and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance. Monitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit. Comply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions. Monitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates. Preserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years. Comply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses. What will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits? Ancillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine. Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult) Syringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL) Alcohol prep pads, 210 per kit Four surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit Vaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length\/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults) COVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More If a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs. Note that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use. Is there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration? CDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies. Data reporting Data reporting What are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with? COVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program. For more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting. Vaccine safety Vaccine safety What additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization? After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS: Vaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not) Serious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event) Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Physicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events. If a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter. Clinical considerations Clinical considerations What are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J\/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)? There is a plausible causal relationship between J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP. What are the symptoms of TTS? TTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae. What is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine? If TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS. For more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology. What allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19? Contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J\/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose. For people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. What is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people? Pregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. For more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19. What is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS. For more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults. What is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients? Immunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people. Based on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination. People should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19. Can COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines? Data are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection. Building vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence How can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines? COVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.

        "text":"AMA News Wire Omicron and BA.5: Questions patients may have and how to answer Fueled by a highly transmissible subvariant of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, known as BA.5, SARS-CoV-2 infections are on the rise again. Even situations that have seemed to carry a relatively low risk, such as outdoor gatherings, may now pose a greater threat. Advancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA But with pandemic fatigue a pervasive reality, many have tried to move on with their lives in search of a new normal without fretting over the latest COVID-19 variants and subvariants. Yet many others, especially people with suppressed immune systems or with underlying conditions that put them at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, have been left searching for answers and further guidance on what to do. Here are some questions patients might have about BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants, along with the answers that physicians should be ready to share. Is the BA.5 Omicron subvariant more contagious? Is the BA.5 Omicron subvariant more contagious? BA.5 is one of the latest subvariants of the original Omicron lineage. There is a unique cluster of mutations on the spike protein, which has led the BA.5 subvariant to potentially be the most contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 so far. But it does not appear to lead to more severe outcomes than other COVID-19 variants and subvariants. Does the BA.5 Omicron subvariant evade immunity? Does the BA.5 Omicron subvariant evade immunity? The short answer is, yes, the mutations of the BA.5 subvariant have allowed it to sneak past the body\u2019s immune system more easily. This means if you had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or have been vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19, you are not completely protected. Compared with the BA.2 subvariant, BA.5 has been able to spread more easily because of its ability to evade immune protection against infection induced by prior infection or vaccination. This is especially if protection has waned over time, contributing to more frequent breakthrough infections and reinfections. While breakthrough infections are not resulting in severe illness, each reinfection does carry the risk of developing long COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions. Discover questions patients have about COVID long-haulers. Is there risk of outdoor transmission with BA.5? Is there risk of outdoor transmission with BA.5? Being outside is safer than being indoors, but there are still some risks to keep in mind as the BA.5 Omicron subvariant continues to circulate. Health professionals have noted that outdoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, but it\u2019s more likely that you will acquire the virus indoors in poorly ventilated areas. While outdoor activities are inherently safer than indoor gatherings, the heightened transmissibility of BA.5 will likely lead to spread in both settings. One thing to note about outdoor transmission is that viral particles can disperse more quickly due to wind speed and air currents. With that, some outdoor settings, such as a tightly packed outdoor concert, can also raise a person\u2019s chances of acquiring SARS-CoV-2. What are the symptoms people are experiencing? What are the symptoms people are experiencing? BA.5 symptoms are similar to previous COVID-19 variants and subvariants. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, coughing, sore throat, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Additionally, the presence and severity of a patient\u2019s symptoms can be affected by their COVID-19 vaccination status, other health conditions, age and history of prior infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). How can I protect myself from BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants? How can I protect myself from BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants? The recipe for protection is one everyone should be familiar with at this stage of the pandemic. Patients should ensure they are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters. Doing so helps to protect individuals from severe disease and death. It is also important to continue to wear a medical grade face mask or respirator\u2014such as a N95 or KN95\u2014when indoors and physical distancing is not possible. It is also a good idea to wear masks in crowded outdoor settings too. On top of getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing a mask or respirator, avoiding crowds and handwashing is also important. Will COVID-19 vaccine booster doses help? Will COVID-19 vaccine booster doses help? COVID-19 vaccines remain the best public health measure to help protect people from COVID-19. Vaccination can also help to reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging. This includes primary series, booster doses and additional doses for those who need them. Data is still being collected on the vaccine effectiveness against Omicron subvariants including BA.4 and BA.5. However, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and death remains high for other Omicron subvariants and likely also for BA.4 and BA.5. Research published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report also shows that during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third dose of an mRNA vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters as well as preventing hospitalization. Meanwhile, a JAMA study shows that receipt of three doses of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine\u2014compared with being unvaccinated or having received two doses\u2014was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants. The AMA has developed frequently-asked-questions documents on COVID-19 vaccination covering safety, allocation and distribution, administration and more. There are two FAQs, one designed to answer patients\u2019 questions (PDF), and another to address physicians\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine questions (PDF). Related Coverage What sets apart Novavax option from other COVID-19 vaccines Will a test tell me if I have BA.5 or another subvariant? Will a test tell me if I have BA.5 or another subvariant? No, a COVID-19 test will not tell you which variant of SARS-CoV-2 caused your infection. Instead, tests will tell you whether you have a current infection. Nucleic acid amplification tests and antigen tests can both be used. But at-home tests are also available for rapid results. If an at-home test is positive, isolate and speak with your physician for further guidance. Discover what doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 testing. What treatments are available for Omicron and its subvariants? What treatments are available for Omicron and its subvariants? Some monoclonal antibody treatments are less effective against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants, but the monoclonal antibody treatment Bebtelovimab remains effective against Omicron. Oral antivirals, including Paxlovid, are also available to treat people with confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of severe illness.

Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Learn what COVID-19 treatments are FDA authorized, and what works. The AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious disease specialist, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills. There are two options There are two options \u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d \u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she added, noting that when this antiviral enters the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d \u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently authorized for use in all adult patients and in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d They prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death While data is still limited, \u201cin one study that was cited in the EUA, Paxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d \u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d The pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure \u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d \u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, the EUA for these two medications really only covers those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said. Related Coverage What physicians need to know about COVID-19 clinical therapeutics Severe COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care \u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d \u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d \u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Paxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets As a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tables of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d \u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is.\u201d \u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Molnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules \u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said. Some side effects are expected Some side effects are expected \u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness.\u201d Share what medications you\u2019re taking Share what medications you\u2019re taking \u201cPaxlovid, because it has that boosting medication ritonavir as one of its components, creates potential drug interactions,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor anybody who receives a prescription for Paxlovid, they should make sure that their physician reviews all of the patient\u2019s other medications that they are taking.\u201d \u201cThat includes over-the-counter medications and supplements or other non-prescription medications that they take, to check for any drug interactions,\u201d she added, noting \u201cit\u2019s easiest to do that through certain drug interaction tools for which physicians will have access.\u201d \u201cMany patients don\u2019t think to mention medications that they\u2019re taking that are non-prescription or that may be supplements, but everything should be mentioned to their physicians,\u201d said Dr. Choi. Supplies are limited Supplies are limited \u201cThe demand is just outstripping the supply for these oral antivirals right now due to the quickly spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi, noting that \u201cmost of the access for these medications are being directed by the state health departments to specific local health departments, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and physician offices.\u201d \u201cNot all physicians will be able to get these medications on demand for their patients\u2014there\u2019s a lot of state-to-state variability,\u201d she said. Consult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant \u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d \u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area and treatments for COVID-19 infection are limited,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d \u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d Not everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills \u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d \u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d Get vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted \u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We have so much more vaccine available than antivirals, currently, and prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d which means two doses of a mRNA vaccine and a booster shot.. \u201cIf they have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine but have not received their COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to get their booster dose\u201d when eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe.\u201d \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines and boosters work against the Omicron variant, and they will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated and boosted as completely as possible against COVID-19.\u201d Visit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics.",

        "text":"Heading into fall, many Americans have concerns about two evolving viruses, the highly transmissible BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant, and monkeypox, which the White House has declared a public health emergency in the U.S.\u2014building on the World Health Organization\u2019s declaration that monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. Advancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA COVID-19 cases have spiked again with BA.5. The good news is most of the country has been exposed to the virus either through infection or vaccination, leading to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths, noted virology expert Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, who helped develop the Corbevax coronavirus vaccine. Still, COVID-19 remains the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. And not enough people are taking advantage of the tools that medical science has offered\u2014either opting against initial vaccination, skipping booster doses or avoiding immunization for their children, said Dr. Hotez, an AMA member. He is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine, and professor of pediatrics and molecular and virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston. In an episode of \u201cAMA COVID-19 Update,\u201d Dr. Hotez discussed vaccine strategies to fight COVID-19 and monkeypox\u2014and why people shouldn\u2019t wait until the fall to get their SARS-Cov-2 vaccine booster dose. Universal vaccine approach Universal vaccine approach Dr. Hotez admits he has mixed feelings about rolling out a bivalent vaccine that targets BA.5. \u201cBy the time it's ready in the fall, BA.5 may be past us and we may be on to something entirely new,\u201d he said. Given that the mRNA booster doses haven\u2019t prevented Omicron subvariant transmission as well as hoped, this might not be the best strategy, he added. It may be time to examine other approaches for boosters. Scientists are looking at longer-term strategies to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine that uses alternative delivery mechanisms via mucosa or skin, he said. This isn\u2019t a quick fix, he acknowledged. Such technologies are still a few years away and right now there\u2019s no funding for them. \u201cWe still need a strong interim strategy,\u201d Dr. Hotez said. Read more about answering patients\u2019 questions on second COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. Boosters offer best protection Boosters offer best protection The boosters now available offer the best defense against COVID-19. Dr. Hotez, who acquired SARS-CoV-2 and discovered firsthand what it was like to experience COVID-19, feels lucky to be vaccinated and fully boosted. For people older than 50 who have had those two boosts, \u201cthat makes all the difference in whether you\u2019re home working or doing whatever you want to do, versus sick in a hospital bed or an intensive care unit.\u201d People shouldn\u2019t wait until the fall to get an updated booster shot, he urged. You might be waiting until December. With BA.5 transmission so high, people should do everything they can to protect themselves and avoid hospitalization. Although he had a rebound infection following receipt of Paxlovid, Dr. Hotez believes eligible people should take it if they get sick. With COVID-19 antiviral supplies now ample, quick action is key. Related Coverage What doctors wish patients knew about monkeypox Could monkeypox become a pandemic? Could monkeypox become a pandemic? While it produces less severe disease than COVID-19, monkeypox is on a worrying trajectory, said Dr. Hotez. The disease most likely spreads through close, personal contact, although the scientific community is divided on whether it transmits through aerosols. Cases are going up, and reported numbers likely underestimate the extent of prevalence, he said. \u201cUnless we can get our arms around this, and really start to beat it back with vaccinations, it's going to generalize across the U.S. population,\u201d in addition to Europe and Latin America, he said. Find out why we must learn from the past in responding to monkeypox. The virus could become a permanent fixture if it gets into animal populations. The next thing that happens is a pandemic, which is why ramping up production of the Bavarian Nordic modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine is so vital, he said. An older, more abundant vaccine used for eradicating smallpox may prove useful, if there\u2019s a way to safely mix and match it with the MVA vaccine, he suggested.

        "link":"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/2794043",
        "text":"In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death in the US, accounting for 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, accounting for 350 000 deaths.1-3 The pandemic may also have indirectly led to increases in other causes of death, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and unintentional injuries.2,4 We examined the leading causes of death in the US, overall and in various age groups, from March 2020 to October 2021. Methods We obtained final national death certificate data for 2020 and provisional data for 2021 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (accessed May 5, 20225). We excluded data more recent than October 2021 because they were incomplete. We determined the 5 leading causes of death by year and age group, and compared the period March to December 2020 with the period January to October 2021. Because the data are publicly available, the study did not require institutional review board review. Results From March 2020 to October 2021, heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%) were the most common causes of death in the US. There were 2.875 million deaths in March to December 2020 and 2.855 million deaths in January to October 2021; the 5 leading causes of death were the same in each year. Among those older than 1 year, the number of deaths increased across age groups. Deaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 accounted for the largest number of deaths in every group aged 55 years and older (Table, Figure). The leading 3 causes of death in these age groups were the same in 2020 and 2021. Among people aged 85 years and older, COVID-19 was ranked as the second leading cause of death in 2020 (110 000 deaths, 12.8% of deaths), and third in 2021 (69 000, 8.9% of deaths). Among those aged 45 to 54 years, COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2020 (17 000 deaths, 10.4% of deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and accidents; in 2021, however, it was the leading cause of death (30 000 deaths, 16.8% of deaths). In both time periods, accidents accounted for the largest number of deaths in every age group 1 to 44 years. Compared with 2020, COVID-19 increased from the fifth (6100 deaths) to the second leading cause of death (13 000 deaths) among those aged 35 to 44 years in 2021, became the fourth leading cause of death in 2021 among those aged 25 to 34 years (5000 deaths), and those aged 15 to 24 years (1100 deaths). Discussion From March 2020 to October 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 deaths in the US and was a top 5 cause of death in every age group aged 15 years and older. Cancer and heart disease deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths overall and in most age groups, whereas accidents were the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years. Compared with the 2020 time period, deaths from COVID-19 in the 2021 time period decreased in ranking among those aged 85 years or older but increased in ranking among those aged 15 to 54 years, and became the leading cause of death among those aged 45 to 54 years. The increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020,6 perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups. The pandemic also has had indirect effects on other causes of death in the US. From 2019 to 2020, death rates increased for heart disease, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes.2 Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes.4 Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups; the pandemic may have contributed to some of these deaths. Our analysis was limited by potential misclassification of the cause of death and incomplete death data for 2021, although we included a lag of 6 months to increase the completeness of the provisional data. Moreover, because our analysis only extended through October 2021, it does not include deaths that occurred during the Omicron wave of the pandemic of late 2021 and early 2022.

        "link":"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamanetworkopen\/fullarticle\/2793927",
        "text":"Key Points Question Is participation in a remote monitoring program for COVID-19, supported by nurses around the clock, associated with subsequent hospitalization? Findings In this cohort study of 9378 patients, participation in a remote monitoring program was associated with lower odds of hospitalization 2 to 14 days after a positive COVID-19 test, after an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting. Meaning These findings suggest that remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 may help patients better manage symptoms at home and help hospitals better manage bed capacity. Abstract Importance Health care systems have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs to manage patients with COVID-19 at home, but the associations between participation and outcomes or resource utilization are unclear. Objective To assess whether an RPM program for COVID-19 is associated with lower or higher likelihood of hospitalization and whether patients who are admitted present earlier or later for hospital care. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational, cohort study of RPM was performed at Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, an academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Participants included patients with internal primary care physicians and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ambulatory setting between March 30, 2020, and December 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. Exposures Activation of RPM program. Main Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations within 2 to 14 days of a positive test. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for differences between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed looking at usage of the RPM among patients who activated the program. Results A total of 10 660 COVID-19\u2013positive ambulatory patients were eligible, and 9378 (88.0%) had email or mobile numbers on file and were invited into the RPM program; the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (16.3) years and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Patients who activated monitoring (5364 patients [57.2%]) had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) free-text comments. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert; 128 of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001). In weighted regression analysis, activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and time period. Monitored patients had a longer mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days), a shorter length of stay (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days), and less intensive care use (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that activation of an RPM program is associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care use, and length of stay among patients with COVID-19. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has required substantial and expeditious changes to health care systems to address challenges posed toward allocating hospital resources, preventing community transmission, and treating patients.1-4 Particularly during the pandemic onset and the waves of more contagious variants, substantial strain has been placed on hospital systems to address shortages of staff, beds, and supplies,5 forcing them to implement rationing programs and measures to match patients with the most appropriate level of care.6 To mitigate community transmission and optimize resource utilization, health care systems have rapidly expanded telemedicine programs across all specialties.7,8 In addition, strategies to care for people at home using remote patient monitoring (RPM) were created to triage and manage patients with COVID-19, who may worsen during the duration of their illness.9 For example, patients who present with mild symptoms at initial diagnosis can deteriorate greatly during the course of their illness, requiring hospital admission and critical care.10 Although RPM has generally been trialed in the management of chronic disease, it may also be an effective tool to manage health care resources for more acute episodes of care.8,11-14 Previous studies8,15,16 evaluated home monitoring in patients with COVID-19 with mild symptoms during self-isolation, with early studies17 showing positive results with fewer admissions. Pulse oximetry at home has been successful in identifying patients needing emergent medical attention.14,18-20 It is unclear, however, whether participating in an RPM program is associated with patient outcomes or appropriate in-person resource utilization. Our objective in this study is to evaluate the implementation of a large-scale daily RPM program for patients with COVID-19 who were managing symptoms from home. We particularly sought to assess the association of RPM with health care utilization (ie, whether RPM would be associated with increased or decreased admissions compared with those not undergoing monitoring). Secondarily, we sought to see whether patients who were eventually admitted would present earlier or later for hospital care. In these analyses, we sought to also know whether RPM was associated with inappropriate admissions (length of stay \u22641 day) or inappropriate home care (a delayed presentation leading to higher mortality, intensive care utilization, or length of stay). Methods Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted within an academic-community health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network provides 1.5 million ambulatory visits and cares for 55 000 hospitalized patients annually. The Health Network operates 45 clinic locations in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. All patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at an affiliated laboratory site who tested positive were eligible for the program. Any patient could request testing either through our mobile application, patient portal, telephone, or in-person urgent care or scheduled ambulatory visits. Patients were automatically invited to enroll in the RPM program if their email address or mobile telephone number was on file at the time of testing. Patients were also invited if they had an affiliated primary care physician (PCP) within the system and had an outside positive test that was abstracted into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver and agreed to the program\u2019s terms of use at enrollment. In addition to the email invitation, patients received a COVID Care Kit, a collection of educational materials, handouts, and a pulse oximeter that was available to pick up from testing sites; after October 2020, kits were automatically shipped to patients. The program group was defined as any patient who activated the RPM program. Activation was defined as claiming an account within the RPM platform. As a sensitivity analysis, we secondarily assessed participation if the patient, in addition to activating their account, had at least 1 or more check-ins, which are programmed questions to which patients respond. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.21 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria All patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of March 31, 2020, through December 15, 2020, at an affiliated laboratory site. Follow-up data collection for hospitalization within 14 days continued through December 31, 2020. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with asymptomatic tests (because these were often scheduled before procedures or other planned admissions), abstracted results, and patients who were admitted within 24 hours of a positive test. We further limited the patient sample to those who had internal PCPs to reduce the chance of missing hospitalizations. COVID-19 RPM Program The COVID-19 RPM program was an automated engagement solution, supported by registered nurses, designed to improve the patient experience, coordinate care, and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On March 30, 2020, the system began the program using GetWellLoop (GetWellNetwork) monitored by a centralized team of Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin nurses. Patients either used a responsive web application or downloaded a mobile application. Patients were asked to track their symptoms, temperatures, and pulse oximetry readings, if available. The program provided 14 days of check-ins related to progress and symptoms, in the form of questions and structured responses, while also providing a space for free-text comments (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The program also provided educational guidance related to COVID-19, including caring for themselves at home, minimizing spread, and stress management. A centralized virtual care team (VCT) monitored patient check-ins and free-text comments around the clock. Abnormal survey responses (eg, breathing issues or worsening fever) alerted VCT members on their dashboard. Upon reviewing the alert, the VCT contacted patients to initiate an escalation of care or to conduct further medical evaluation if warranted. VCT nurses also reacted to patient comments independently from alerts to provide education or coaching, such as how to incorporate lying in the prone position (ie, proning) into their daily care. Patients were discharged from monitoring after 18 days. Data Collection Data for evaluating program outcomes were collected using reporting databases from the EHR (Epic Systems). We collected patient profile data, including sex, age, race, address, marital status, insurance, and PCP status (internal or external). Race was assessed in this study because of known racial and ethnic disparities in accessing digital health care services.22-24 We used patient addresses geocoded to the Census block level to determine the local area deprivation index, derived from the US Census and American Community Survey,25 as a measure of socioeconomic status and grouped by quartile.26-28 Data about the clinical scenario (including presence of symptoms and their onset) were derived from the individual testing orders. We obtained other clinical data, including body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and comorbidities as calculated through the Charlson Comorbidity Index29,30 from the EHR as of the testing date. Participation in the RPM program was provided through platform usage data. These data included system registration, activation, check-ins, alerts, and comments. Main Outcomes and Measures Our primary outcome was hospitalization within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Hospitalizations were included if they had a flag as being related to COVID-19 through laboratory testing or hospital billing diagnosis. Hospitalizations outside the health system were not available, and readmissions were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the likelihood of missing outside hospitalizations, we limited the analysis to patients with an internal PCP because patients with external PCPs may be more likely to seek hospital care elsewhere. To know whether RPM inadvertently may have been associated with increased mortality, such as by delaying hospitalization, we secondarily tracked patient deaths of the study cohort. Thirty-day mortality and 90-day mortality were defined as a patient marked as deceased within the EHR and\/or having a death date noted within 30 or 90 days, respectively, of a positive test date. Mortality data were extracted from the EHR system in November 2021 in case death reporting in the EHR lagged. Statistical Analysis Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. To examine factors associated with activation, patients were divided into those who were enrolled and activated and those who were enrolled and did not activate. Age was categorized for analysis. We calculated the frequency for variables related to patient demographics and information related to personal health and COVID-19 status, along with means and SDs for time intervals, such as length of stay and time from test to hospitalization. A t test was used to test the mean difference of the 2 groups (RPM activated or not) in terms of the characteristics measured in continuous variables, whereas a \u03c72 test was adopted for categorical variables. For time intervals (time to hospitalization and length of stay), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Two-sided tests were used with a priori levels of significance of \u03b1 = .05. All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31 To assess the association between activation and hospitalization, we performed propensity-weighted logistic regression using the glm package.32 With all patients being invited to use the RPM program, we used inverse propensity score weighting to account for potential bias in the observed covariates through self-selection or other mechanisms following methods by Olmos et al.33 Covariates included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, time period, insurance, marital status, Area Deprivation Index from the Census block level, encounter type where testing was ordered, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, prior hospitalization, and digital engagement proxied as having reviewed their COVID-19 test results electronically through the patient portal or the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin mobile application. We also included a variable for time period (1 of the 3 waves in 2020) to allow for varying mean differences in outcomes over time due to patient behavior, including care avoidance34 at the beginning of the pandemic, and guideline changes during the 3 COVID-19 waves that could have affected enrollment status or clinical outcomes. The average treatment effect was calculated as the mean difference in weighted outcomes between the activated group and the invited but nonactivated group. Inverse probability weights were based on the propensity score of each patient,35 defined as the probability of a patient activating RPM conditional on observed covariates as described already, for doubly robust estimation.36 With less than 4% of the data missing observations for either socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or obesity, the primary analysis was run on complete cases. We used multiple imputation using the mice37,38 package to confirm the results. We ran additional models that included only activated RPM patients and factoring whether they engaged in the program (had check-ins digitally) or not. We also performed propensity score matching with full matching39 using the MatchIT40 package. Finally, we performed a propensity-weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis on complete-case data using the Survival41 and Survminer42 packages. In the weighted Cox model, the starting point was the date of the test and patients were only censored at day 14. Results During the study period, 135 786 patients underwent testing for COVID-19, and 25 040 patients (18.4%) had at least 1 positive test. Of these patients, 10 660 were retained for analysis after excluding those who were younger than 18 years, who did not have an internal PCP, or who were hospitalized at the time of testing (Figure 1). A total of 9378 patients (88.0%) were offered enrollment into the RPM program through an email invitation, comprising the final analytical cohort. The mean (SD) age of invited patients was 46.9 (16.3) years, and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Engagement With the RPM Program Of the 9378 invited patients, 5364 (57.2%) activated monitoring (Table 1). Patients who activated were predominantly female (3467 of 5364 patients [64.6%] vs 1981 of 4014 patients [49.4%]). Differences in activation by race and ethnicity were not significant, although differences by comorbidities were observed. Patients with Medicare were also less likely to activate than those without Medicare (795 of 5364 patients [14.8%] vs 769 of 4014 patients [19.2%]; \u03c72 3 = 38.65; P < .001). When patients requested testing through our digital platform for testing, 1805 of 2927 patients (61.7%) activated, whereas 354 of 723 patients (49.0%) with in-person visits activated (\u03c72 5 = 61.25; P < .001). Patients who activated had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) comments with their clinical care teams. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert. Utilization and Clinical Outcomes One hundred twenty-eight of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized within 2 to 14 days of their test (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001) (Table 2). The odds of admission were higher for patients with advanced age, male gender, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with obesity or more medical comorbidities. The mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization was slightly longer among activated patients (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days). Among those patients admitted, the mean (SD) length of stay was 2.7 days lower for RPM-activated patients than for nonactivated patients (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days; t = \u22123.4185; df = 244.03; P = .001). Monitored patients had less intensive care use than those who were not monitored (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Patients with RPM were not significantly more likely to have short (length of stay \u22641 day) hospital stays (47 of 222 patients [21.2%] vs 50 of 210 patients [23.8%]). The unadjusted 90-day mortality for all patients was 0.2% (10 patients) among activated patients and 0.6% (26 patients) among nonactivated patients. Logistic Regression With Inverse Propensity Score Weighting In multivariable regression analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (for the likelihood of activating RPM, the C statistic was 0.67; for balance and propensity distribution, see eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement), activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) (Table 3). Results using multiple imputation for missing data were similar (eTable 1 in the Supplement). As a robustness check, the Cox proportional-hazard regression with inverse propensity score weighting provided similar results (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), as did regression with propensity score matching (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). As a sensitivity analysis of only activated patients, patients with check-ins had a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73; P = .001) after weighting on propensity to have at least 1 check-in (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Discussion In this retrospective cohort study of 9378 patients who were offered RPM for COVID-19, activation of the RPM program was associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and length of stay. Following an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting, patients who activated still had lower odds of being hospitalized, adjusted for observed clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Although a strict control group was not available, because of the rapid implementation and goal of assisting patients and clinical operations, several methods including the inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching were used to balance the comparison cohorts on the basis of the observed covariates. The positive outcomes seen in reducing hospitalization are similar to those described in earlier studies.11,17,43-45 We found baseline differences between patients who did and did not active RPM, similar to prior studies, although our application of the inverse propensity score weighting provides a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of these observed differences on our result and a more advanced analytical evaluation of the association of RPM with the main study outcomes. Our study is also different because it was delivered to a more general population as well. The mechanism underlying RPM\u2019s association with hospitalization is not clear, but several factors may explain it. First, patients who were monitored also received education that may have affected their care trajectory, such as proning to help improve oxygenation. Second, physicians caring for patients who received the pulse oximetry and nurse support through the RPM might have felt comfortable not sending patients into the emergency department and hospital. An alternate explanation is that patients who activated were less ill, and residual confounding that could not be removed accounted for these differences. In both inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching, with reasonable C statistics and matching parameters, the associations persisted. In addition to findings related to hospital admission, the data showed that patients who were admitted to the hospital while being monitored were hospitalized later than those without monitoring. Although the reasons behind such delays are not immediately known, there are different hypotheses that may explain this finding. One could be that the RPM program allowed patients to be managed and monitored at a level that would have required an admission for those who were not enrolled in the RPM\u2014that is, either the patient or a clinician chose to defer hospital-based care because of the availability of RPM. Another factor could be that the nurses\u2019 support through the RPM program delivered remote care that decreased risk and led to only essential admissions. This finding does not support a preintervention hypothesis that RPM would signal patients to be admitted earlier. The findings suggest that, although patients under RPM were admitted, on average, later than non-RPM patients, the late presentation was not inappropriate given that hospital length of stay, critical care utilization, and mortality were not increased in this group. Our study also found that age and race were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization. These results mirror the current body of evidence suggesting who is most at risk both for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe symptoms.46-48 To that end, although RPM and other digital interventions can be effective in deploying and allocating scarce health care resources, we must continue investigating whether such strategies exacerbate existing disparities in care utilization and outcomes. These disparities have been observed in many other digital health interventions, including video visits and telemedicine.49-51 The lessons learned from our study and others are numerous, although many questions remain regarding best practice RPM implementation for COVID-19 and other diseases and conditions. First, it remains unknown at which point in the course of disease RPM is most impactful on outcomes. Although the digital component of the RPM is easily scalable, concerns regarding other components should be carefully evaluated. In our study, we implemented a remote nurse support model. The virtual nurses had full access to the EHR and could communicate with clinical care teams. Expanding similar programs across multiple areas and diseases would require sophisticated operations and resource allocations. Further research and evaluation of these new remote operating models are warranted and should be carefully evaluated for safety. Expansion of these programs should consider access and equity. In a previous study,50 we have demonstrated that access to digital technology is disproportionate among racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our program was accessible to anyone with a smartphone, although some technological literacy is required. Simple text messaging may also help reach additional people. Limitations Some limitations of this study should be addressed. With the observational nature of the study, selection bias of healthier patients into the RPM activation exists, and although we used propensity score adjustment, residual confounding may still persist. The data were retrospective and sourced from databases, which may make the results less reliable. For example, we could not verify whether hospitalization, escalation of care, or mortality were a result of COVID-19 or another cause. To mitigate this effect, we attempted to limit follow-up data to include 15 days given the reported duration of symptoms, and we reexamined mortality data from the EHR after at least 9 months following the study period. Location and hospital system factors may have influenced enrollment rates and clinical outcomes, which could make our results less generalizable to all populations. In addition, COVID-19 treatment guidelines (decision to place patients in the prone position or intubation recommendations), diagnosis (evolving symptom profile), and community transmission were highly dynamic during the early course of the pandemic.52,53 Clinical outcomes may have improved throughout the course of the pandemic. The RPM program was also rapidly updated throughout the pandemic, although the core content of monitoring, proning as tolerated, and infection control for ambulatory patients remained the same. These data were from the prevaccine era; after vaccines became available54 and distributed,55 the absolute benefit of RPM may have decreased for low-risk individuals. Conclusions This report builds upon experiences from other groups showing that RPM for COVID-19 was feasible and well-received, while adding data about outcomes. Moving beyond COVID-19, these data highlight where RPM can be a helpful adjunct to care. Resource optimization is a central tenet of both RPM and pandemic-era practices. If reducing avoidable admissions can be achieved through virtual interventions, then practitioners can focus on in-person care for the most ill patients while also limiting unnecessary contact at hospitals and clinics, which is key to decreasing the spread of COVID-19. These results may also be used to establish better care guidelines for those monitoring moderate symptoms from home. Future studies should include ethnically diverse and low health care access populations, which are shown to be at higher risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19.

        "text":"Vaccine authorization Vaccine authorization What processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness? Any vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy: COVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF) The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues. The American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process. What information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"? Data and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA. Data to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following: Chemistry, manufacturing and controls information Nonclinical data and information Clinical data and information Administrative and regulatory information How does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take? The FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA. Are mRNA vaccines safe? mRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. There are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. More information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC. Vaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution How will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)? Initial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers. Tribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service. How can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution? The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. When will vaccine be distributed to physician offices? In April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step. Vaccine administration Vaccine administration What do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines? To receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll. What vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of? COVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage). COVID-19 vaccine providers are required to: Store and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance. Monitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit. Comply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions. Monitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates. Preserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years. Comply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses. What will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits? Ancillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine. Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult) Syringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL) Alcohol prep pads, 210 per kit Four surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit Vaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length\/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults) COVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More If a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs. Note that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use. Is there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration? CDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies. Data reporting Data reporting What are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with? COVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program. For more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting. Vaccine safety Vaccine safety What additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization? After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS: Vaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not) Serious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event) Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Physicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events. If a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter. Clinical considerations Clinical considerations What are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J\/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)? There is a plausible causal relationship between J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP. What are the symptoms of TTS? TTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae. What is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine? If TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS. For more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology. What allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19? Contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J\/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose. For people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. What is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people? Pregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. For more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19. What is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS. For more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults. What is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients? Immunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people. Based on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination. People should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19. Can COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines? Data are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection. Building vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence How can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines? COVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.

        "text":"WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 The American Medical Association (AMA), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) strongly oppose the ordering, prescribing, or dispensing of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. Ivermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use to treat infections caused by internal and external parasites. It is not approved to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin is also available to treat certain veterinary conditions; medications formulated or intended for use in animals should not be used by humans. We are alarmed by reports that outpatient prescribing for and dispensing of ivermectin have increased 24-fold since before the pandemic and increased exponentially over the past few months. As such, we are calling for an immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing, and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. In addition, we are urging physicians, pharmacists, and other prescribers\u2014trusted health care professionals in their communities\u2014to warn patients against the use of ivermectin outside of FDA-approved indications and guidance, whether intended for use in humans or animals, as well as purchasing ivermectin from online stores. Veterinary forms of this medication are highly concentrated for large animals and pose a significant toxicity risk for humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have issued advisories indicating that ivermectin is not authorized or approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization, and Merck (the manufacturer of the drug) all state there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. The Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 also recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of a clinical trial. Use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has been demonstrated to be harmful to patients. Calls to poison control centers due to ivermectin ingestion have increased five-fold from their pre-pandemic baseline. A recent CDC Health Alert Network Advisory (PDF) recommends that health care professionals should counsel patients against use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19, including emphasizing the potentially toxic effects of this drug, including \u201cnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Overdoses are associated with hypotension and neurologic effects such as decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma, and death.\u201d For more information, we encourage patients and health care providers to consult the FDA\u2019s Consumer Update on Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19 and the CDC Health Alert Network Advisory on the Rapid Increase in Ivermectin Prescriptions and Reports of Severe Illness Associated with Products Containing Ivermectin to Prevent or Treat COVID-19. Patients are encouraged to talk to their physicians, pharmacists, and other prescribers about currently available therapies authorized or approved for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The most effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 are to get vaccinated, wear a face mask, stay at least six feet from others in public places, wash hands frequently, and avoid large crowds of people. Our organizations strongly urge eligible unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated. AMA COVID-19 Resource Center for Physicians APhA COVID-19 Resource Center ASHP COVID-19 Resource Center",

        "text":"Key Points Question Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a decrease in the number of cancer screening tests globally? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 publications, the screening types analyzed were associated with a significant overall decrease (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) from January to October 2020. This decrease showed a U-shaped trend with a negative peak in April 2020 (\u221274.3% for mammography and \u221269.3% for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test) and in March 2020 for Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test (\u221278.8%). Meaning COVID-19 pandemic measures were associated with widely reduced cancer screening services, which was possibly associated with delayed cancer diagnosis and increased cancer mortality. Abstract Importance Public health services, including cancer screening tests, have been affected by the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. Objective To investigate the pandemic\u2019s association with cancer screening worldwide. Data Sources In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. Study Selection Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period. Results The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) for breast cancer screening, \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was \u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified. Conclusions and Relevance A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level. Introduction In 2020, according to GLOBOCAN estimates, 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million cancer deaths occurred owing to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, which are the first, third, and seventh most prevalent cancers worldwide, respectively.1 Screening programs help to detect cancer at early stages or precursor lesions, leading to decreased mortality. In the past few years, especially in low- to medium-income countries,2 cancer screening and prevention protocols have had a remarkable impact on public health. However, major events, such as natural disasters and epidemics, can negatively affect screening rates and access to health care infrastructures and facilities,3 increasing the burden of cancer mortality. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a suspension of many nonurgent medical services was imposed all over the world. Affected services concerned, for example, family planning and abortion4; HIV prevention, testing, and care5; cancer prevention; specialistic treatments such as delays or deferrals in oncologic surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy; and visits for oncologic patients.6 Consequently, cancer screening programs have been temporarily interrupted in most countries. Although these measures may have led to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission,7 their association with public health must still be determined.8 Because the lockdown restrictions have been heterogeneous in their beginning date and duration, we performed a systematic review of studies that analyzed the variation in the total number of examinations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening performed since the beginning of the epidemic in comparison with the prepandemic period. Our aim was to quantify the global variation of cancer screening procedures during the lockdown period. Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We conducted our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.9 We developed the study question by following the patients or the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) and study design framework. This study is part of a larger project aimed at assessing the global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer, including not only cancer screening but also cancer diagnosis, diagnostic tests for cancer, therapies for oncologic patients, and first visits and follow-up visits for oncology patients. The search string was unique for all these outcomes. We launched the search string on PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus, without language restriction, for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. The search string was made using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and Medical Subject Headings terms and their builder options, if relevant, to improve the search results. Searches were performed with the following terms: neoplasms, diagnosis, drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control, early detection of cancer, COVID-19, and organization and administration. We included observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries. We chose articles including a comparison between the periods before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with results indicated as number of screening tests performed, percentage variation between the 2 periods, or rate of screening. Studies were excluded if data on at least 1 of these comparisons were not available. We included only studies in which the 2 compared periods were explicitly stated. If the comparison was made between 2 or more pre\u2013COVID-19 periods, we selected the closest period as a reference (eg, we considered 2019 if data for both 2019 and 2018 were available). Data Collection and Quality Assessment Our database search and study selection process are outlined in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We found a total of 3630 total articles: 998 articles on PubMed, 1471 on ProQuest, and 1161 on Scopus. We collected initial references in citation files, removed duplicates (1007 articles), and began our screening process of the remaining 2623 articles. We initially excluded articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish, or Italian, and also reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports (245 articles). After this process, studies were first reviewed by title and then by abstract. Finally, we examined the full text of each article against eligibility criteria, and we collected 140 studies for all the outcomes of the research project (screening, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, visits, and therapies). Results on cancer screening were reported in 39 articles. We decided to analyze the types of cancer screening recommended for the general population by the US Preventive Services Task Force.10-12 We excluded screening types performed for high-risk individuals (eg, lung cancer screening13) and those with lower-grade recommendation (eg, prostate cancer screening14). The title and abstract of the articles were independently reviewed by 2 pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) for inclusion in the first screening phase, followed by the full-text screening phase against eligibility criteria. Disagreements among reviewers in the initial abstract screening phase and full-text review were resolved through discussion with a fifth reviewer (P.B.). Two pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) perused the prepared checklist to extract from each article the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, country and type of setting (hospitals and private centers were considered clinic based; local and national cancer registries were considered population based), site of cancer, type of screening analyzed (mammography, research of blood in the stool with the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, or human papillomavirus test), and absolute number or rate of screening tests performed in the analyzed period or percentage variation between intervals before and after the beginning of the pandemic. In particular, for colorectal cancer screening, we analyzed data from both types of screening (fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy) separately and together. We performed an assessment of the quality and risk of bias of all the studies included, using 9 of the 10 items of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research,15 for a maximum score of 10 points. Studies obtaining less than 7 points were considered inadequate and excluded (no article was excluded because of a low-quality score). eTables 1 through 3 in the Supplement list the articles included in the present analysis and their major characteristics and quality assessment. Statistical Analyses For each type of screening, we calculated the weighted average of the percentage variation between screening tests performed before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight was calculated with the natural logarithm of the number of daily events in the prepandemic period (ie, daily_screen_precovid obtained by dividing the number of screening tests in the prepandemic period by its duration in days: weight = ln [daily_screen_precovid]). We used the logarithm because of the great variability in the number of tests between studies. We used the absolute value to avoid negative weights. Some studies did not provide the absolute number of screening tests performed in the prepandemic period, but only the measure of variation between the period being examined and the reference period. For these studies, to calculate the weight, we imputed a value of daily_screen_precovid as the mean value of this variable in the studies having the same type of setting and cancer screening. We divided the pandemic period into 5 intervals (all referring to 2020) based on the beginning date of the COVID-19 period being examined in each article as follows: period 1 from January 1 to February 29; period 2 from March 1 to March 31; period 3 from April 1 to April 30; period 4 from May 1 to May 31; and period 5 from June 1 to October 31. This partition of the 5 periods was based on temporal distribution of the available observations along the pandemic period and on the trend of COVID-19 spread and pandemic measures in most countries.16 We did not include studies in which the pandemic period started before January 2020. We did not find studies in which the pandemic period of observation started after October 2020. Studies could contribute to more than 1 period, but not more than once in each period. Then we calculated weighted averages for each interval. Because each period analyzed was determined only by the starting date of the observation, for some studies it could include an interval longer than the predefined periods (eg, an observation that considered January 1 as the starting date and May 31 as the end date was included in the first period). An additional analysis was performed for specific geographic areas and for type of setting. We finally fitted ordinary least-squares linear model using Newton-Raphson (maximum likelihood) optimization with percentage change as dependent variables and terms for type of structure, geographic area, and period as independent variables. In the linear regression model, 2-sided P values were used, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. Because a percentage reduction could not be lower than \u2212100%, we limited the values of the 95% CIs to \u2212100.0% in case they exceeded it. We considered the funnel plot and performed the Egger regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias.17 No ethics committee approval and no patient consent were necessary because the study was restricted to publicly available data. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). P values of differences of means are based on the t test, those of differences of proportions are based on z scores, and P tests of multivariate analyses are those derived from the regression generalized linear models for the respective variables. Results Data on race and ethnicity, as well as demographic information for the study population, were not available. eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the weighted average variation of screening tests performed by cancer type, and Figure 2 shows the corresponding temporal trend. Breast Cancer The average variation of breast cancer screening from January to October 2020 was \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period. The maximum decrease in breast cancer screening occurred in April 2020 (\u221274.3% [95% CI, \u221291.8% to \u221256.7%]), whereas after June there was no significant reduction (\u221213.0% [95% CI, \u221233.0% to 7.1%]). The weighted average of the screening variation was \u221262.0% (95% CI, \u221275.1% to \u221249.0%) for clinic-based settings and \u221241.6% (95% CI, \u221253.2% to \u221230.0%) for population-based ones. The difference between the 2 types of structures was confirmed to be statistically significant in the linear regression analysis (adjusted difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 35.9%; P = .03) (Table 1). We divided the geographic areas for breast cancer screening according to the distribution of the countries analyzed in each study: North America (United States and Canada), South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and Europe (Italy, France, and Turkey). In North America, the number of breast cancer screening tests decreased by \u221244.6% (95% CI, \u221257.4% to \u221231.8%) during the COVID-19 period. In this geographic area, the decrease was \u221219.4% (95% CI, \u221255.1% to 16.2%) in January and February, \u221249.9% (95% CI, \u221266.5% to \u221233.2%) in March, \u221286.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221273.5%) in April, \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221262.3% to \u221213.4%) in May, and 0.8% (95% CI, \u221214.1% to 15.7%) from June to October 2020. Europe presented an average variation of \u221267.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u22129.3%), and South America presented an average variation of \u221251.1% (95% CI, \u221267.5% to \u221234.7%). As shown in Table 1, the decrease during April was significant (\u221253.8%; 95% CI, \u221275.4% to \u221232.2%; P < .001), using January and February as the reference; studies from Europe also reported a larger decrease compared with those from North America (\u221235.6%; 95% CI, \u221265.9% to \u22125.3%; P = .02). Colorectal Cancer The overall decrease in the number of colorectal cancer screening examinations performed throughout the period from January to October 2020 compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period was equal to \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%). In particular, the decrease for colonoscopy was \u221252.5% (95% CI, \u221266.3% to \u221238.8%), and the decrease for fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test was \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221249.9% to \u221225.8%). The weighted average variation was \u221251.5% (95% CI, \u221269.5% to \u221233.6%) in clinic-based settings and \u221243.7% (95% CI, \u221254.9% to \u221232.6%) in population-based ones. Compared with the prepandemic period, the global evolution by period showed the greatest decrease in April 2020 (\u221269.3% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221236.9%]) and only a partial recovery during the last months of the analysis (\u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]) from June to October (eTable 4 in the Supplement). We analyzed the 3 main geographic areas, including North America (United States and Canada), Asia (India, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and Europe (Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). The weighted average variation during the entire COVID-19 period was \u221245.1% (95% CI, \u221259.3% to \u221231.0%) for North America, \u221234.6% (95% CI, \u221258.1% to \u221211.1%) for Asia, and \u221252.4% (95% CI, \u221269.4% to \u221235.3%) for Europe. For North America, the greatest decrease was in April (\u221283.0% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221255.8%]), whereas in Asia the most remarkable decrease in screening rates was observed in January and February (\u221236.2% [95% CI, \u221277.9% to \u22125.6%]). In linear regression analysis, April had a greater decrease compared with January and February (\u221238.3%; 95% CI, \u221263.6% to \u221212.9%; P = .003), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between geographic areas (Table 2). Cervical Cancer For cervical cancer screening, the weighted average variation was equal to \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%). The maximum decrease observed among the 5 periods was in March (\u221278.8% [95% CI, \u221299.3% to \u221258.3%]). In the linear regression model (Table 3), a significant decrease was observed in March compared with January and February (\u221238.9%; 95% CI, \u221275.2% to \u22122.5%; P = .04). Clinic-based studies showed a greater reduction than the population-based ones: \u221251.7% (95% CI, \u221277.3% to \u221226.1%) and \u221251.9% (95% CI, \u221267.8% to \u221235.9%), respectively. In North America (United States and Canada), the weighted average variation was \u221244.7% (95% CI, \u221273.8% to \u221215.7%), whereas in South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico), it was \u221262.4% (95% CI, \u221273.3% to \u221251.5%). Discussion This study investigated the association of the COVID-19 pandemic measures with cancer screening by systematic review. Against a global pattern showing an increasing trend for colorectal cancer screening and a slight decrease for cervical cancer screening and mammography from 2000 to 2015,18 our study found a marked association with a decrease in the number of tests performed for the 3 cancer types (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) in all geographic areas considered during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the decision to interrupt all cancer screening programs, the main factors that may have caused this reduction were stay-at-home orders, people's fear of the infection, avoidance of nonurgent medical treatment and care, limited access to in-person medical examinations, and the reorganization of hospital departments.6 The greater decrease for the Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test and colonoscopies may be attributable to more invasive techniques used to diagnose these tumors compared with mammography for breast cancer and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer. We identified a similar pattern by period for breast and colorectal cancer screening, with a U-shaped trend having a negative peak in April 2020 and an attenuation in May. This trend was largely attributable to the lockdown measures in numerous countries and territories worldwide. As illustrated through the stringency index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,16 in April 2020 most of the countries had implemented COVID-19 measures. All 3 types of cancer screening showed the least reduction from June to October. A significant feature of the present study is the analysis of different geographic areas; Europe presented a larger decrease in mammograms compared with North America (Table 1), which could be associated with the fact that in the United States, they are mostly performed through private health insurance,18 whereas in Europe, they are usually provided as part of the public health care system. Conversely, the decrease was similar for colorectal cancer screening between the 2 regions. The restrictions that occurred in Europe could therefore have had a greater association with the cancer screening procedures that imply an actual attendance to the health care structure providing the service. Our results indicated that invasive colorectal cancer screenings (colonoscopies) had a larger decrease than noninvasive ones, such as fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test (\u221252.5% vs 37.8%, respectively), which were more easily performed as a colonoscopy alternative.19 Unlike the global decrease in colorectal cancer screening, Asia presented the most remarkable decrease in January and February; however, the variability of COVID-19 epidemiology and restrictive measures between Asian countries20,21 complicates the interpretation of this matter. The percentage variation for cervical and breast cancer screening was greater in South America compared with North America (\u221262.4% vs \u221244.7% and \u221251.1% vs \u221244.6%, respectively); however, we cannot assume that it will result in worse consequences for Latin America owing to its weaker health care system before the pandemic.22 An important aspect of our review was the consistency of results across a wide spectrum of health care settings. The association between the epidemic and cancer screening was greater in studies based in hospitals or other clinic settings than in population-based studies, especially for breast cancer screening (\u221262.0% vs \u221241.6%; P = .03), which could be explained by clinic-based studies\u2019 considering only the decrease in the number of patients who actually attended the screening test vs population-based studies\u2019 including also patients who did not participate in screening programs in the prepandemic period. There was no evidence of publication bias either qualitatively according to funnel plot asymmetry or quantitatively with the Egger regression test. The aim of identifying early neoplastic lesions in the case of breast cancer and precursor lesions in the case of colorectal and cervical cancer was to decrease the incidence of invasive cancer.23 The most concerning potential effect of a decrease in cancer screening is an increase in cancer mortality, as estimated in the United States.24 The interruption of cancer screening could delay diagnosis of tumors, causing a shift to more advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, this could be associated with increased avoidable cancer deaths, aggravate the patients\u2019 discomfort and disease burden, and be associated with increased workload for medical personnel and increased costs for the health care system.8,25,26 In addition, a portion of the postponed screening tests could be impossible to recover because during the suspension some patients exceeded the maximum age to be included in screening programs. Limitations Our review has some limitations. First, considerable heterogeneity between countries was present in terms of screening protocols,27 services\u2019 accessibility and participation of the target population, lockdown measures, and incidence of COVID-19 and its temporal trend; all of these factors could not be considered in our statistical analysis. Second, the attribution of an observation to 1 of the 5 periods was based only on its beginning date, which might lead to nondifferential misclassification. Future studies on variations in screening numbers will need to be performed to clarify long-term implications and adopt adequate public health strategies. Third, in some studies we had to impute the number of daily events to calculate the weight. Conclusions The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, with a U-shaped temporal pattern. Although for breast and cervical cancer screening, the data suggest a recovery after May 2020, the decrease in colorectal cancer screening persisted until October 2020. This is expected to be associated with an increase of avoidable advanced cancers and cancer-related deaths. Further investigation regarding cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is required. Back to top Article Information Accepted for Publication: May 18, 2022.

COVID screening in India, where cases caused by the BA.2.75 variant are rising.Credit: Mohd Arhaan Archer\/AFP\/Getty As countries await the end of COVID-19 surges caused by the variant BA.5, researchers are on the lookout for what will come next. An Omicron subvariant called BA.2.75 \u2014 and nicknamed \u2018Centaurus\u2019 by some on social media \u2014 is rising fast in India. A few scientists are sounding the alarm, whereas others say it\u2019s too early to tell whether the variant will spread widely. In India, it doesn\u2019t yet seem to be driving up hospitalization or death rates. BA.2.75 has been detected in more than 20 countries worldwide, and researchers are waiting to learn whether it will substantially elevate case numbers after a wave of infections with BA.5. A slew of studies suggests that the two variants have roughly similar capacities to dodge immunity conferred by infection and vaccination. This suggests that \u2018Centaurus\u2019 might not push cases much higher outside India \u2014 at least not while population immunity is high and before the variant picks up many extra mutations. On the alert Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants is falling by the wayside in many countries, but India seems to be at the epicentre of the spread of BA.2.75. This mutation-laden lineage evolved from the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, which spread widely in early 2022 (see \u2018Pathogen progression\u2019). Researchers in India have sequenced more than 1,000 samples of the variant since May. The data suggest that about two-thirds of new cases there are currently caused by BA.2.75, says Shahid Jameel, a virologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who previously led India\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 sequencing consortium (see \u2018\u2018Centaurus\u2019 grows\u2019). The variant seems to have a \u201cquite sizeable\u201d transmission advantage over BA.5 in India, says Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who has modelled its rise. \u201cThis would definitely cause an infection wave,\u201d he says. The number of confirmed infections \u2014 a sliver of the probable true number \u2014 is up across India, Wenseleers notes, as is the percentage of tests that come back positive (a more reliable measure when testing rates are low). So far, BA.2.75 has been detected at relatively low rates outside India, in countries including Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, which are in the middle of or just past the peaks of surges caused mainly by BA.5. As a result, Jameel does not expect BA.2.75 to trigger big waves in most places. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to a point where these variants are sort of competing with each other and they\u2019re almost equivalent,\u201d he says. \u201cI think people who have had BA.5 will not have a breakthrough infections with BA.2.75, and vice versa.\u201d Neck and neck Laboratory studies posted on preprint servers in recent weeks lend credence to this idea1\u20135. Several teams have found that the two variants have a similar ability to evade antibodies triggered by vaccination and previous infection, with BA.5 showing a slight edge over its distant cousin. This makes BA.2.75\u2019s rise in India \u2014 where BA.5 is also present \u2014 fairly perplexing, says Yunlong Richard Cao, an immunologist at Peking University in Beijing who co-led one of the studies1. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d His team thinks that India\u2019s immunity profile is part of the explanation. In 2021, the country saw an explosive wave of cases caused by the Delta variant, which shares a key mutation with BA.5. Cao suspects that previous Delta infections provide added protection against BA.5, leaving an opening for BA.2.75. Cao and his team found that several people who had had Delta infections after vaccination produced antibodies that were more potent against BA.5 than against BA.2.75. \u201cMy guess is that BA.2.75 probably won\u2019t prevail that much outside India\u201d, especially in countries that weren\u2019t hit hard by Delta, Cao adds. Source: Data from GISAID and Tom Wenseleers. Other researchers say the small number of Delta infections after vaccination in Cao and his colleagues\u2019 study means the hypothesis should be treated with caution. Moreover, Wenseleers has found tentative signs that BA.2.75 might be spreading a little faster than BA.5 in some countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. He predicts that BA.2.75 will continue to grow globally, particularly in Asia and Oceania. But there are also signs that another Omicron sub-lineage that's growing in Europe and North America, called BA.4.6, is just as transmissible as BA.2.75. \"We might end up with an eclectic mix of Omicron descendants, with different ones reaching dominance in different parts of the world,\" Wenseleers says. No hospitalization surge So far, India isn\u2019t seeing a significant rise in hospitalizations from its \u2018Centaurus\u2019 wave, says Jameel, who gives credit to the combined effects of high rates of vaccination and of previous infection. \u201cThis hybrid immunity is going to largely protect and keep people out of hospitals,\u201d he adds. Wenseleers and others expect the same pattern to be repeated elsewhere \u2014 whether the next variant is BA.2.75 or something else entirely. \u201cHigher and higher population immunity leads to less and less severe consequences for most people,\u201d he says. If BA.2.75 doesn\u2019t spread widely now, it could in several months\u2019 time, as it picks up new immune-evading mutations and protection caused by BA.5 infection wanes, says Cao. Some BA.2.75 sequences include a mutation found in BA.5, called L452R, that could augment the variant\u2019s ability to reinfect people, he adds. \u201cThis is what makes it scary.\u201d Even if hospitalization and death rates stay low in a wave caused by Centaurus or whatever comes next, researchers say, the high frequency of infection waves could mean more long COVID and general disruption caused by high levels of illness. \u201cThe next thing we need to do is bring down infection volumes,\u201d says Wenseleers. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d",

COVID-19 rebound After the COVID-19 antiviral Paxlovid began to be used in late 2021, researchers noticed that some people experience a rebound in the virus and symptoms after taking the drug. Two recent studies suggest that it is surprisingly common for SARS-CoV-2 to return in untreated cases of COVID-19 too. To determine the frequency of rebound, Jonathan Li, a physician-scientist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and his team analysed data from hundreds of people who were randomized to receive a placebo in a large-scale trial of COVID-19 antibody drugs. More than one-quarter of participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported a rebound in their symptoms, according to the study, which has not yet been peer reviewed. \u201cThe main take-home message is that recovery from COVID-19 is not going to be a linear process,\u201d Li says.

How trees grow in a warmer world This chart shows how the early arrival of spring, due to climate change, affects the growth of trees and the amount of carbon they sequester. In a paper in Nature, researchers investigated the consequences of an early start to the growing season in deciduous forests. Leaf emergence is followed by carbon uptake through the process of photosynthesis. Over time, carbon can be captured for long-term sequestration if it contributes to the radial growth of stems or to wood formation. The areas under the curves represent annual growth in terms of: the amount of carbon captured by leaves (top curves, brown); annual radial growth (lower left curve, blue); and increase in woody biomass (lower right curve, red). The authors report that the early arrival of spring, which shifts the margins of the growing season (lighter curves), had little impact on the final annual tree-ring width or the amount of woody biomass produced, whereas high temperatures in summer had a negative effect on radial growth (dotted curve). Other studies (plotted here as dotted curves) indicate that high temperatures and related drought can suppress carbon capture and woody-biomass production. The study provides evidence that warmer springs have advanced the leaf emergence of temperate deciduous forests but have not substantially increased their wood production. This suggests that the extra uptake of carbon dioxide does not contribute to sustainable carbon sequestration in the trunks of long-lived trees, as our News & Views article explains.",

A device called the Gesundheit-II can collect viral RNA exhaled by people infected with SARS-CoV-2.Credit: Isabel Teresa Sierra Maldonado People infected with the highly transmissible Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 spew out higher amounts of virus than those infected with other variants, according to a new study1. Further, individuals who contract COVID-19 after vaccination, and even after a booster dose, still shed virus into the air. The work was posted on the medRxiv preprint server on 29 July. It has not yet been peer reviewed. \u201cThis research showed that all three of those variants that have won the infection race \u2026 come out of the body more efficiently when people talk or shout than the earliest strains of the coronavirus,\u201d says John Volckens, a public-health engineer at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Study co-author Kristen Coleman, who researches emerging infectious diseases at the University of Maryland in College Park, says this means that people should be \u201cpushing governments to invest in improving indoor air quality by improving ventilation and filtration systems\u201d. Breathe out For the study, Coleman and her colleagues recruited 93 people between mid-2020 and early 2022 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Participants\u2019 infections were caused by strains including the Alpha variant, which emerged in late 2020, and the later Delta and Omicron variants. All participants with the latter two strains had been fully vaccinated before catching the virus. The infected people faced into a cone-shaped apparatus and sang and shouted \u2014 with inevitable coughs and sneezes in between \u2014 for 30 minutes, while an attached machine collected the particles they exhaled. The device, called a Gesundheit-II, separated out the fine \u2018aerosol\u2019 droplets measuring 5 micrometres or less in diameter, which can linger in the air and leak through cloth and surgical masks. The team found that participants infected with the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants emitted significantly more viral RNA when exhaling than did people infected with other variants. These include ancestral variants, such as the one first detected in Wuhan, China, and those not associated with increased transmissibility \u2014 such as Gamma, which arose in late 2020. For participants with Delta and Omicron, their fine aerosol contained on average five times the amount of virus that was detected in their larger, coarse aerosol. The team also seeded cells in the laboratory with aerosol samples and found that four samples, each from a participant with either Delta or Omicron, infected the cells. Shed virus is not always infectious, says study co-author Jianyu Lai, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, and the samples\u2019 ability to infect laboratory cells means that viral RNA in exhaled aerosols can spread the disease. Malin Alsved, an aerosol technology scientist at Lund University in Sweden, says: \u201cI\u2019m bit concerned that they mix all the respiratory [aerosols] \u2014 they have breathing, talking, speaking, screaming, coughing, even sneezing in the sample.\u201d Coleman responds that the team combined respiratory samples to mimic a real-life scenario such as being in a restaurant. Going viral The study also highlights the variation between individuals in the amounts of exhaled virus, which ranged from non-detectable levels to those associated with \u2018superspreaders\u2019. One Omicron-infected participant, for example, shed 1,000 times as much viral RNA through fine aerosol as the maximum level observed in those with Alpha or Delta. The researchers say that the root of these discrepancies remains a mystery but could be related to biological factors such as a person\u2019s age. Behaviour might play a part, too: the study\u2019s superspreader coughed more frequently than others. If new variants are more prone to superspreading, that might drive them to dominate COVID-19 cases. The team notes that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhale much lower amounts of viral RNA than people infected with influenza, a comparable airborne disease. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could spin off variants that transmit even more virus. \u201cThat is something to be concerned about,\u201d says Alsved.",

IHME\u2019s COVID projections are in development as a result of new analyses differentiating between infection-derived immunity and vaccine-derived immunity. We are actively updating the model to incorporate these new analyses and hope to have results in the coming weeks. To be alerted of new COVID-19 insights, subscribe to our newsletter. Our COVID-19 resources: July 22, 2022 Key takeaways: COVID-positive hospital admissions are rising in the US. However, it is unclear whether the hospitalizations are due to COVID, or if individuals tested positive after being admitted for other reasons. However, it is unclear whether the hospitalizations are due to COVID, or if individuals tested positive after being admitted for other reasons. We remain optimistic that there will not be a large amount of severe COVID , due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections. , due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections. Our recommendations: It is not necessary to implement mask or social distancing mandates at this time. National surveillance systems should track the underlying cause of hospital admissions. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Rising COVID-positive hospital admissions in the US In some jurisdictions in the US, there are rising reported hospital admissions with COVID, and in some cases, examples of rising deaths. This has caused considerable policy discussion about whether it is time to reinstate mandates, such as the consideration of mask mandates in LA County. The challenge that we have in understanding what's happening with BA.5 is that this is a very common infection. We see lots of evidence of considerable transmission in the community that is not translating into a big surge in reported cases, largely because we believe there is so much rapid antigen testing at home. Many COVID hospitalizations are incidental We do see rising numbers of hospital admissions, and the challenge \u2013 as we've spoken about before \u2013 is distinguishing incidental, that is people coming to the hospital with some other problem, who happened to be COVID-positive when they get tested, from true COVID admissions. Unfortunately, in this country we don't have data on COVID admissions where they are positive for COVID and that's the reason for admission. Some hospital systems are reporting this. There are reports from USC, for example, in LA County, that fully 90% of hospital admissions are incidental, meaning it is quite possible that we don't have reason to be that concerned about BA.5 transmission. Read more in Nature \u00bbHeart disease after COVID: what the data say Unlikely to be many cases of severe COVID It could well be, because of high levels of immunity in the population from vaccination and from past infection, and quite widespread use of Paxlovid, if we look at the data in the US, that there isn't really cause for concern that there's going to be a large amount of severe COVID. This means, perhaps, that it is not the time, at this point, to be considering imposition of new mandates such as mask mandates or social distancing mandates. The situation globally This is a phenomenon we're seeing in other countries as well \u2013 it's not unique to the United States. There are reports from New Zealand, for example, in the last few days, of a marked increase in daily deaths. And again, this challenge is there, as well as in many countries in Europe \u2013 Norway is another example \u2013 where incidental from underlying is not being distinguished. It could well be just that BA.5 is a very common infection. The only way we're going to resolve this for the future is if national surveillance systems make the effort to track hospitalizations and distinguish them by the underlying cause of admission. We remain reasonably positive and optimistic about the course of BA.5 in the US and elsewhere. We do see early signs that it may have peaked already in the US and is starting to come down \u2013 that's not true for every state, but in general it does seem to be following the course that we've seen in other countries around the world. July 20, 2022 Key takeaways: BA.5 is surging around the world, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. We anticipate waves to last around four to six weeks, based on other locations\u2019 experiences. particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. There are several new challenges for accurately tracking the pandemic: More people are using at-home tests and not reporting infections to public health authorities, making it difficult to gather accurate case counts. Countries have different requirements for COVID testing upon hospital admission, leading to variation in rates of hospitalization due to COVID, compared to incidental cases. Our policy recommendations: Encourage booster shots. Make antivirals available to all, particularly those in low-resource settings. High-risk individuals should consider social distancing and masking as transmission increases. Do not focus on getting vaccines to those who have never been vaccinated. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.5 surges around the world In this week\u2019s COVID update from IHME, we\u2019re looking at the surges around the world \u2013 particularly in North America, Latin America, and most of Europe \u2013 that are traced to the combination of mobility levels being above pre-COVID levels, mask use globally down to 16% or less, and of course the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron. Interpreting the data has new challenges It is becoming increasingly challenging to make complete sense of the COVID-19 surges in different countries, as we see very different biases in different countries coming into reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths. For reported cases, we're seeing very modest to no increase in some countries in Europe, as compared to hospitalizations. Same in the United States. And we believe that's because of the widespread use of rapid antigen tests at home and in most countries people not reporting that to the public health authorities. They don't get into official case numbers. In contrast, for hospital admissions \u2013 if you want an extreme example of this disconnect, look at Norway, where hospital admissions have gone up dramatically and yet cases have gone up only slightly. But for hospital admissions, most countries have required COVID testing for all patients, at least most high-income countries, meaning that you detect a quite substantial number of individuals who have COVID, but have gone to hospital for some other reason. We tend to call these \"incidental\" COVID admissions. The degree to which there will be incidental COVID admissions depends on how much transmission there is broadly in the community. So we should expect under Omicron, the problem of incidental hospital admissions is dramatically larger than with a much more severe variant, such as Delta in the past, where there was less transmission in the community, and those coming to hospital who were COVID-positive were much more likely to be there simply because of symptoms of COVID. So, challenging interpretation. And if you want to have a contrast to Norway, look at Mexico, where the increase in reported cases is dramatically higher than the increase in hospital admissions. We don't know if that's because there isn't the same testing requirement, of universal testing for COVID for hospital admissions, or if there is less home use of tests. Either way, it's becoming quite a bit harder to make sense of the available data. Should we be very concerned about BA.5? Probably not. In the places that started earlier \u2013 South Africa, Portugal \u2013 that had their BA.5 waves begin before other locations, we've seen from the beginning to the peak, it lasts about four to six weeks. So in many cases where countries are three-four weeks into these surges, we do think that we will see \u2013 and the models tend to back up that observation \u2013 we do expect to see peaks coming in the near future. Meaning that there isn't a reason to be particularly alarmed about BA.5, Our long-range models also suggest in the Northern Hemisphere that we may \u2013 in the absence of a new variant that changes the whole story \u2013 we might expect to see a further winter or late fall Omicron wave start up again in October, and that would be a pattern that we saw in 2020 and 2021. Whether that happens depends very much on this balance between waning immunity from prior vaccination \u2013 so whether or not people get a fourth booster in places where they have access to that, whether they want a fourth booster \u2013 versus waning immunity from infection and the protection provided from infection with Omicron for either other subvariants or future variants. All of that means to say that it's possible that we have a late-fall surge again from Omicron because of waning immunity. Government policy recommendations The strategies available for governments right now are less on getting people who have never been vaccinated, vaccinated. The data out there suggest very few people anywhere in the world who want to be vaccinated have not been, even in low-resource settings. As opposed to the available strategies, which might focus more on getting those who are willing to be vaccinated, who have been previously vaccinated, getting a further booster to enhance their protection against severe disease as that also wanes over time; broader use of antivirals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and then, for those individuals who are at particularly high risk, consideration of social distancing and masking as transmission in your community goes up. As a backdrop to all of those strategies, the thing that we are learning, that is, two and a half years into this pandemic, is just how important surveillance is. Paradoxically, in many ways, the data stream that we have today is worse than a year ago because of some of the issues that I started with in this video about home testing, and different definitions of incidental versus underlying COVID for both hospitalization and death. So, very challenging on the surveillance side, but absolutely critical that we keep monitoring the pandemic and trying to do it in as comparable a fashion as possible, and particularly keeping track of new variants. That's our roundup of what we see in our analysis this week in the release of our new forecasts. June 24, 2022 Key takeaways: In the United States , COVID is currently on the decline, but BA.4 and BA.5 could change that. Why? Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Previous infection provides less immunity against BA.4 and BA.5. Mobility is increasing while mask wearing declines. , COVID is currently on the decline, but could change that. Our recommendations for the US: Individuals should get another COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine before the winter. States should secure antivirals, especially for those at high risk. Governments should continue screening for new variants. On a global level, we see a rise in some European countries, including France, Germany, and the UK. The future is still unclear in China, but much of the population remains susceptible to severe infection. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.4 and BA.5 in the United States In the United States, reported cases, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decline. This is the pattern we have seen in the northeastern states. It is spreading across the United States, and we project that this will continue all the way until the end of September, when we are expecting another wave. We are concerned in the United States because of the fast spread of BA.4 and BA.5 \u2013 they are escape variants in that it seems from the new studies we are looking at, that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection of BA.4 and BA.5. They are still very effective in preventing severe illness and mortality, but we are concerned that with BA.4 and BA.5 spreading fast with the relaxation of mandates and with the patterns we are seeing in some European countries where there is a third wave, we are concerned that there is potential here for another bump or increase in cases in the coming months. We will update our models the second week of July, and we will include all this new information in our models. We will then predict if we see a third wave or not, and how big it will be and how long it will last. In general, we're heading in the right direction in the United States. Our recommendations for the US We're expecting a surge in winter, and the focus right now in the United States should be on vaccinating people and getting the booster, and then getting another vaccination before the winter, especially also with flu. We expect that flu season could be bad because we haven't seen flu in the past three years. Our recommendation would be to take another COVID-19 vaccine before winter and a flu vaccine. Also, our recommendation is for every state to secure enough antivirals in order to make sure they are provided to infected people, especially those who are at high risk, elderly, and people with immunocompromise or with risk factors, chronic conditions, to make sure that we reduce the burden on our hospitals and we save lives. And, of course, continue screening and making sure that we don't lose track of what's circulating in our country, and if there is an increase in cases due to another variant or pre-existing variant, we take the measures that are necessary to stop the spread of this virus. Cases rising in Europe On the global level, what we are seeing right now is a rise in some European countries. We see a third wave, driven mainly by BA.4 and BA.5, and the relaxation of mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We see the third wave with an increasing number of reported cases, and we see it in France, in Germany, beginning of it in the UK, in Greece, in Israel. That's a big concern for us because what has happened before in Europe has happened here in the United States, and we could see here in the United States a third wave, especially from BA.4 and BA.5, which are increasing as a percentage of the variants that are circulating. We know right now from several studies that previous infections from other variants do not provide as much immunity against Omicron and BA.4 and BA.5. Also, the vaccines are less effective in terms of preventing infection. They're still effective against severe illness and mortality for BA.4 and BA.5. So putting these two together, we are very much concerned that we could see potentially in the United States another wave after the second wave due to BA.4, BA.5, relaxation of the mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We will update our numbers in July, most likely the second week due to the holiday, and we will take into account all this new information about the spread of BA.4 and BA.5 in Europe, and the new studies that are showing less effect of the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5. Future unclear in China China remains a big mystery for us \u2013 we don't know what's going to happen in China. They're successful so far in containing the virus, but this could change as soon as they change their policy and open up the country because they have had fewer infections because of their success before, their vaccine is not as effective, and much of their elderly population is not vaccinated. So we could see a rise of cases in China as well. June 10, 2022 Key takeaways: Global infections are increasing : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October. : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October. Outlook still uncertain for China: Strict lockdown measures continue to be successful but come at an economic cost. Strict lockdown measures continue to be successful but come at an economic cost. Policy insights and recommendations: Mask mandates in parts of the US are unlikely to have a large effect. We must maintain global surveillance to prepare for the possibility of new variants. Ensure access to antivirals for vulnerable individuals. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Global infections are increasing In this week's release from IHME of our COVID forecasts, there are some key observations of what's happening around the world and what we see coming in the models. Globally, we're starting to see the estimated number of infections go up again, and that's driven by secondary Omicron waves in a number of places in sub-Saharan Africa, in a wide array of locations in Latin America, from Quintana Roo, other states in Mexico, through to a number of states in Brazil and all the way in between. There are also some small increases in states in India, and perhaps most concerning is a quite substantial secondary wave of Omicron in Portugal, related to the BA.5 variant with an associated meaningful increase in the death rate, which we have not generally seen with these secondary Omicron waves in Europe and the northeast of the US. The last place where there is some secondary increase from Omicron is some of the Southern states in the US and some of the states in the Midwest. Omicron peak is expected in June Despite these increases, we remain reasonably sure in the modeling that they will peak sometime in June, given what we've seen in Europe with the secondary waves, and what we've seen in the northeast of the US, as well as what we saw with the BA.4-5 wave in South Africa. So we expect these to be short-lived, and to not really alter the global trajectory over the next few months. An outbreak in China could have a major global impact The big question mark remains, at the global level, what happens in China. We are assuming that strict lockdown measures will continue through to October, and that they will be, as they have been to date, successful. The reporting of 11 cases today in Shanghai will raise the real questions about the economic toll in China from the strict lockdown policies, but so far there's no indication of a change from the leadership in China. 120,000 deaths expected globally by October 1 Putting all that together in our forecasts, we do not see large numbers of deaths. Although when you add it up around the world, still about 120,000 deaths are to be expected between now and October 1. The other insight that comes from the modeling is that we expect to see numbers starting to go back up again in the Northern Hemisphere in early September or late September, likely leading into increases \u2013 modest increases \u2013 in the fall. Mask mandates in the US unlikely to have a big impact There is some concern in parts of the US seeing secondary Omicron waves, such as in California, where some mandates have been put back in place, namely mask mandates, for example in Alameda county. As far as we can tell from both the modeling, as well as from the experience elsewhere of the secondary waves, we don't necessarily think that will have a big effect, nor is it necessary given the low infection-fatality rate and given the availability of antivirals, particularly, which should mean that we won't see a substantial increase in death. Some of the debate about this is getting still obscured, this many months into Omicron, because we are not getting good data that differentiates incidental hospitalizations \u2013 people coming to hospital with COVID-19, but that's not the reason for their hospitalization \u2013 from hospitalizations and deaths where COVID is the true cause. And without that it's very easy for a highly contagious and reasonably prevalent infection like Omicron to appear like the numbers are increasing substantially. Continuing surveillance for new variants and access to antivirals will be key Clearly all of this optimistic view over the next few months at the global level is predicated on the idea that there will not be a new variant that has immune escape and is more severe than Omicron. But of course, that is a distinct possibility and it highlights why maintaining global surveillance \u2013 so that if such a variant emerges, the world knows about it as soon as possible \u2013 is really crucial, as is preparing for access for the vulnerable for antivirals, because that's likely in the future to be the strategy that will make the biggest difference if a new variant comes along. June 3, 2022 Key takeaways: Global death toll declining: We are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020. We are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020. China: Zero-COVID strategy continues to prevent major death surges, despite economic consequences. Zero-COVID strategy continues to prevent major death surges, despite economic consequences. Europe & South Africa: BA.2 and BA.4-5 surges have peaked and are now declining. BA.2 and BA.4-5 surges have peaked and are now declining. United States: Cases are declining at the national level, despite some continued surges at the state level. Cases are declining at the national level, despite some continued surges at the state level. Policy recommendation: Monitor for new variants and be prepared to respond if a new, more dangerous one should emerge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Daily death toll declining globally This week at IHME in our update on COVID, we do not have a new model release. That will be coming next week, but we continue to monitor the pandemic. We are really reaching, at the global level, an extraordinarily low level of the impact of COVID. In fact, the death toll at the daily level has now reached the level we last saw around March 20, 2020. We continue to see this very favorable trend down. Low or declining cases in China, South Africa, Europe, and the US At the location level, the strict lockdown policy, zero-COVID strategy in China continues to work, although it has great economic effects. The reported cases, as far as we can tell in China, are now down to a very low level. We do expect in our modeling, and continue to expect, that it will be hard to sustain that, given the considerable number of susceptible individuals that are still in China. Elsewhere, where there were surges related to either BA.4 or BA.5 in South Africa, that's peaked and continues to decline. The BA.2 surges in Europe seem to have all peaked and are pretty much declining. Here in the US, as we expected, at the national level it appears that case reporting has peaked and is starting to come down, but of course that varies by location. The decline is more in the northeast. Other states are still on the upswing, but nationally we should start to see the numbers come down. We do continue to expect, in the absence of the emergence of a variant with considerable immune escape on Omicron, that we will see quite low numbers through the next few months. We must continue monitoring for new variants Of course, we've learned through the pandemic that the emergence of a new variant can completely change the story in a very quick manner. But for now, it does appear like those countries that are largely returning to pre-COVID levels of interaction and very low levels of mask use will continue to see low or even declining transmission, and certainly low or declining impacts in terms of death, given the slow but steady scale-up of the use of antivirals. So, there are very favorable conditions for the moment. We do believe it's important to keep up surveillance and to be ready on a country-by-country basis to respond with booster shots, with access to antivirals, and if a dangerous, high-severity new variant with immune escape emerged, to be able to reconsider other actions as well. May 27, 2022 Key takeaways: South Africa & China: Cases appear to have peaked and are now declining. Cases appear to have peaked and are now declining. United States: The increase in cases is slowing and expected to peak by early June. The increase in cases is slowing and expected to peak by early June. Current recommendations: Offer boosters to those who want them. Provide antivirals to at-risk individuals who get infected. Continue surveillance for potential new variants. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Evidence of BA.4-5 cross-variant immunity in South Africa This week from IHME, we do not have a new release of our models, but we are continuing to track the evolution of the current pandemic. Of major areas of interest, in South Africa, the BA.4-5 related increase in cases has peaked and is coming down, which fits with the expectation that while there was some reduction in cross-variant immunity from BA.4-5 compared to previous waves of Omicron, it was not very large. Omicron under control in China Likewise, we're seeing that the measures put in place in China for strict lockdown, at least according to official data, continue to be successful, with case numbers coming down. Of course, the question will be whether or not there are going to be \u2013 as we expect, given the large volume of susceptible individuals \u2013 further Omicron outbreaks, and the need for other efforts at strict lockdown in China, still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. Cases expected to peak in the US within a few weeks In the United States, the increase in cases, probably driven by behavioral relaxation, seems to be slowing. There is a spatial heterogeneity aspect to this, but for example, in our own hospital system at the University of Washington, our number of hospital admissions has peaked and is starting to come down, as an example of a place with one of these surges. So, as we've been expecting for many weeks, we do not think these current increases in the US will lead to large-scale increases in death, certainly, or hospitalization. We should see a peak about the end of May or early June at the national level. Current recommendations Pending the emergence of new variants that are more severe than Omicron, the current strategies of continuing to offer boosters to those who would like to get a booster, making sure that antivirals are available for those who are at risk who do get infected with Omicron, and continuing surveillance, are the most important aspects of monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. May 20, 2022 Key takeaways: Regional updates: China continues zero-COVID strategy and reports no increase in cases. South Africa may be reaching a peak of the BA.4\/BA.5 winter surge. The United States is experiencing an increase in Omicron cases \u2013 likely due to behavioral changes, and possibly due to re-infection with BA.2 \u2013 but not an increase in deaths. Mandates: We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. Cross-variant immunity: New research suggests limited immunity against other variants after Omicron infection. However, immunity from vaccination and previous infection does provide strong protection from severe illness and death. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity China reports no increase in cases We do not have updated models this week, but we continue to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic around the world. Areas of ongoing interest are the approach to zero-COVID in China, which continues. Officially reported cases are actually not increasing, and they're maybe coming down, but stringent mandates are in place in many locations. From experience in other countries, we do expect at some point that Omicron will spread widely in China, but it is very much a question of when \u2013 and when the government decides to stop pursuing this zero-COVID strategy. Cases increasing in South Africa and United States Elsewhere in the world, we're seeing increases. The BA.4- and BA.5-related and winter-related increase in South Africa continues. It is certainly not as exponential as the original Omicron wave, but it does continue to increase. With some indication, it may be reaching a peak. In the United States, Omicron continues to increase in a number of states. That increase, again, seems to be like what we've observed in many countries in Europe, related to behavioral relaxation and possibly BA.2 re-infection of people who have had a prior Omicron infection \u2013 although it's perhaps easiest to account for through behavioral change. Mandates not expected to be reimplemented In neither case, neither what we saw in Europe nor what we're so far seeing in the United States, are we seeing an increase in death, which is very good news. That's likely because there is either vaccine-derived or infection-acquired immunity, so that people aren't fully immunologically naive, and perhaps because of the increased use of antivirals when individuals do become sick, which should have a marked effect on the death rate. We don't, at this point, think that there's reason for large-scale concern and also do not expect, with few exceptions, that there will be implementation of mandates in these jurisdictions, outside the zero-COVID strategy in China. New studies show limited immunity from Omicron infection One of the critical factors that do go into the long-range modeling, and even the short-range, is the extent to which Omicron infection provides protection against subsequent new variants, or even sub-variants of Omicron. There was a paper in Nature this week, which is a lab-based paper, based on the immune responses from serum from different types of patients, which suggests that there may be a limited cross-variant protection from Omicron infection. Read more in Nature \u00bbLimited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination We'll really want to wait and see when studies are able to start reporting, from actual infection in individuals, what sort of cross-variant immunity there is. Both from vaccine-derived immunity and infection-acquired immunity, the available studies suggest much lower protection against Omicron infection, pretty good protection against severe disease and death, but greatly reduced for infection. We'll have to wait and see whether that difference holds true for Omicron on Omicron by sub-variant, or even future variants, namely less protection against infection, but hopefully more protection against severe disease and death. That issue will have a profound effect on what the fall and winter may look like, as we do expect waning immunity, both from vaccines and infection-acquired immunity, plus indoor exposure and opportunities for transmission, that there should be increased transmission potential in November, December, and January, and the extent to which there is long-range protection from severe disease and death will have a marked effect on outcomes. May 16, 2022 - US reaches 1 million COVID deaths As the United States reaches this somber milestone, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray reflects on the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how we can better prepare for future health threats. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity The US has officially surpassed the awful milestone of a million reported deaths from COVID. This is a number that I think very few of us thought would ever come to pass when the pandemic started to break in February of 2020. In fact, back then we thought a concerted response would mean that the number would be a tenth of that, or even less. Now, the true number of deaths from COVID is even larger. We think, based on looking at excess deaths, it's probably closer to 1.3 million deaths that have already occurred in the US, but by either metric, it's a staggering number. COVID has had a terrible toll, not just here in the US but around the world, with 6 million reported deaths and more than 18 million excess deaths; those deaths are distributed throughout the regions of the world and not just in North America or in Europe. We've entered a new phase of the pandemic, a phase where Omicron is much milder and a large fraction of the world's population has been infected with Omicron. The Omicron story has still to play out in China and North Korea, but in general we're entering this phase where people are going back to pre-COVID levels of interaction. Mask use is declining dramatically, and I think that's going to be the new normal. We will see continued Omicron transmission, and Omicron will come back in the winter if we don't see a new variant. But it's likely we will see a new variant, and so while we might think that the era of mandates and profound changes in behavior might be behind us, we certainly haven't seen the end of COVID-19. We should be thinking about how we manage COVID-19 new variants as they emerge and the critical role of continued use of boosters, vaccinating those who are still willing to be vaccinated but haven't been, and the new tools that we have like Paxlovid and potential other antivirals as they come along. All those combined mean, even if we have a new variant, we don't expect it to be as bad as it has been, which is good news. But it should give us pause to recognize the threat that we live with in the future, for either some remarkable new variant that will break through our current tools entirely, or new pathogens and new pandemics in the future. Hopefully, this extraordinary experience in the US will motivate the US government and other governments to invest in greater capabilities to respond to new threats; detect them earlier; have a more rational, thoughtful, but rapid response to those threats as they emerge; and then to figure out who are most vulnerable, whether it's the groups that are essential workers, or those that have some sort of comorbidity, or those that are elderly. Whatever it may be for a new threat, it's critical that we learn about protecting the most vulnerable for future rounds of threats as they emerge. At this terrible milestone, it is an opportunity for us to reflect both on what went wrong and how we can solve and prepare ourselves better for future rounds of COVID and future threats. May 12, 2022 Key takeaways: East Asia: As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. United States: Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Short-term: We predict a small peak in May to early June, but no major surge until the winter. Long-term: We predict as many as 30% of the US population will get infected through the winter with Omicron due to declining immunity. However, we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals. Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Global: Data from South Africa do not indicate that BA.4 and BA.5 will lead to a major global surge. Our recommended strategy for dealing with COVID on a global scale is securing access to antivirals for all. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Omicron and the zero-COVID strategy in East Asia Last week in IHME\u2019s updated forecasts, we certainly were trying to take into account what\u2019s unfolding in East Asia with continued rapid expansion of the Omicron epidemic in Taiwan, and that continues to expand. There\u2019s this very challenging question of how Omicron will play out in China. The government is pursuing their zero-COVID strategy with lockdowns as needed. We have been expecting Omicron, since February, in our modeling to eventually break through these efforts because it has appeared that control efforts on Omicron have been generally less successful around the world than for previous variants. So far, these strict lockdown policies have kept Omicron numbers at a relatively low level. It's extremely hard to understand how the policy environment will play out in China. If they pursue strict lockdowns, it's possible they will keep Omicron transmission at a relatively modest level through to the fall. We do believe that it is inevitable there will be a large Omicron outbreak at some point in China, because maintaining a strict zero-COVID strategy is probably unsustainable as the year progresses, but it's impossible to know when that change in policy will occur. Increasing cases in the United States and predictions for the winter In the US, we're seeing increases in a number of parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, and some of the West Coast, in cases and hospital admissions. This is a pattern that follows what we\u2019ve seen in Europe as people's behavior goes back to pre-COVID levels, and there is a little bit of transition to BA.2 and perhaps BA.4 and BA.5 as they continue to spread. We do expect a modest increase in numbers. Our expectation is they will peak sometime in May or early June and then go back down. We don't expect a major surge from that. There have been reports from the White House of their efforts to model in the long term a large surge in infections. In our long-range models, which we do not release publicly, we do expect in the winter a return Omicron surge. Of course if there's a new highly infectious variant that's more severe, that would trump this pattern we expect. We expect a surge in the winter because of declining immunity from exposure to Omicron, as well as declining immunity from vaccination and perhaps not as high a rate of repeat boosters as we've seen for the third dose, going into the future. The consequences of a winter surge in the US should be much smaller because of Paxlovid and increasing availability of antivirals and use of antivirals. We certainly expect quite large numbers in the winter, not so much in the fall \u2013 perhaps as many as 30% of the US population getting infected through the winter with Omicron. But we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals. We don\u2019t expect much in the way of government mandates, given the much lower ICU admission rate and death rate that should occur with these new strategies, particularly antivirals. Global strategy should be ensuring access to antivirals for all At the global level, there's been ongoing debate and concern about BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. There\u2019s not an exponential surge there; there's a very slow increase in numbers. We so far are not seeing any indication that BA.4 and BA.5 could be the driver of a major global surge in cases, but of course this warrants monitoring on a regular basis. Overall, in terms of general strategy globally, we've seemingly maxed out globally on the number of people who are unvaccinated that want to be vaccinated \u2013 as far as we can tell from the data, only about 3% of the world wants a vaccination that hasn\u2019t received one. A lot of that is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, but still it's not a large percentage of the population. Perhaps the main strategy to deal with future variants is making sure that anyone who needs antivirals will get access to antivirals. There's a lot in that, both in terms of production of Paxlovid and health system infrastructure, and response patterns so that when somebody needs it, they can get it whether they're in a low-resource or high-resource setting. Those are our main observations on the epidemic as it continues to unfold. May 9, 2022 Key takeaways: Global: Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. 3.1% of the population who wants a vaccine has still not received one, most in Africa. We must ensure equity in distribution of antiviral medication. Eid El-Fitr celebrations in Islamic countries could lead to a small increase in cases. Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. United States: Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. Home testing and delayed reporting of infections has made it more difficult to track COVID-19. We recommend: continuing surveillance for new variants, securing antiviral medication, preparing to return to mask use and physical distancing if another variant arises. Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. China: The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. The current rise in Taiwan and previous surge in Hong Kong are warning signs of what could happen. The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Projections and recommendations for the United States We have increased our projections to September 1. Right now in the United States we are projecting 1.02 million deaths by September 1. That's an additional 29,000 deaths from May 2, when we ran our programs. For the United States, the recommendations remain the same: We need to continue our surveillance and make sure we are doing enough sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the United States, and if BA.4 and BA.5 are being introduced in the US and how fast they are spreading. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have enough antiviral medications in order to distribute them. We know from their clinical trials that they reduce hospitalization and mortality, and they will reduce the pressures on our hospitals. Third, which is very important, if we are seeing a rise due to another variant in the United States, we should go back to wearing masks and physical distancing. In the United States we are seeing an increase in reported cases and hospitalizations. In some states, we are seeing the rate of increase in admissions to hospital is much higher than the rate of increase of reported cases. We believe that's due to the fact that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting to their counties and not using the local labs, so we are not capturing these cases. BA.4 and BA.5 under study in South Africa We are monitoring closely what's happening in South Africa, the infections with BA.4 and BA.5. We don't know yet if they are immune escape and they are infecting people that have been previously infected by BA.2. It's too early to tell, and the fact that many people in South Africa have been infected by Omicron 4-5 months ago, it's possible that the waning immunity is resulting in the infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Chinese population remains susceptible, relying on zero-COVID policy At the global level, mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. The global trends are mainly dominated by what's happening in China. Right now we are seeing a rise in cases in Taiwan. China is continuing with its zero-COVID policy and we feel that they will be able to control COVID-19 for a while. However, the economic pressure may not allow them to continue with such a policy. If what we are seeing happen right now in Taiwan, or what happened previously in Hong Kong, will happen in China, we project a lot of mortality, unfortunately, and the surge will overwhelm the hospitals. Many older Chinese people are not vaccinated at the same level as other countries, and also the vaccines used in China are less effective than the vaccines used elsewhere, mRNA vaccines. So we would expect a major surge and a rise in mortality in China. Vaccine and antiviral equity: we are not safe until all of us are safe Based on vaccination rates and our monitoring of people who are willing to take the vaccine, we estimate right now that about 3.1% of people globally who want to get the vaccine and are willing to get the vaccine, have not received it. The majority of them are in Africa. We need to make sure that people who want to get the vaccine are receiving them, who failed distribution, which countries should support poor countries to get the vaccine and vaccinate their population. Again, we're not safe until all of us are safe. The most important thing moving forward right now globally is to ensure that the global distribution, like with vaccination, that global distribution for antivirals is going forward and countries can secure what they need from antiviral in order to provide it to people who are infected, to reduce hospitalization and mortality. Projections in Islamic countries following Eid El-Fitr We are not projecting a rise in cases in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean region, WHO region, but we are concerned in many Islamic countries after Eid El-Fitr celebrations with all the mobility, and people are visiting each other and celebrating the holidays. It's possible in some of these countries the decline will slow down and it's possible in some countries that we'll see a small surge in the coming weeks due to the holidays and the celebration. Challenges with data collection At IHME, with our projections, our major challenge in the coming months is the delay in reporting. Many countries and many states have moved to weekly reporting and it's very hard for us to monitor the situation. The fact in the United States that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting their infections to the local health departments is making it hard for us to follow the epi-curve. We are using admissions to hospitals, COVID-19 admissions, as our main indicator and some places like the United States, where we believe many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting those results to their local health department, we have lowered the infection-detection rate in order to make sure we'll be able to monitor these trends. April 29, 2022 Key takeaways: Omicron will continue to spread in China. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. Cases are increasing in Delhi, India, and South Africa. The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? A concerted policy push is needed to increase access to antivirals. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and now a rapid scale-up in production must follow. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Omicron spreading in China This week from IHME we are not releasing a new set of projections yet. With few exceptions, the epidemic is still continuing to track our forecasts from earlier in the month. The key areas to pay attention to right now are, first and foremost, what's happening in China with the Omicron wave spreading, most importantly to Beijing. Many other cities within China apparently are also under lockdowns or partial lockdowns. As we have been noting for months pre-Olympics, it's really a question of time when Omicron will spread more widely in China, given how transmissible it is, given the comparatively lower efficacy of the vaccines used in China, and particularly this issue that the zero-COVID strategy may not actually work. But our understanding is that the government will pursue that strategy vigorously, at least until the fall. So, no real change in expectations there, but it simply will be a challenging question as to whether that strategy can hold out until the fall. Increasing cases in India The second area of concern that people have been tracking has been the steady uptick in cases in Delhi, India. The question is whether this is due to declining immunity from the prior Omicron wave or the possibility of one of the sub-variants of Omicron fueling transmission in Delhi. They have re-imposed their mask mandate, so we\u2019ll see if that has some effect on that one part of India and the surrounding state of Haryana having some increased transmission. BA.4 and BA.5 variants in South Africa The third area of concern is the uptick in South Africa associated with the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, a steady increase but not exponential. The question remains \u2013 is that because these sub-variants are more transmissible, or is it because they have immune escape over BA.1 and BA.2, which were there in South Africa and had become the predominant variants, or is it because of waning immunity, just through time. We are now, for South Africa, pretty much four months, or even four and a half in some provinces, after the peak of the Omicron wave. Access to antivirals The other main consideration globally around managing COVID, particularly in China and for the world, when new variants that are potentially more severe emerge, is access to Paxlovid. We\u2019ve started to finally see some policy discussion around the importance of availability and access to Paxlovid. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and the question is, will there be more rapid scale-up in production? We strongly believe that needs a concerted policy push, equivalent to the efforts to expand vaccination. We will certainly expect more from IHME as we run our models in the near future to reflect any new updates in the data as we\u2019ve been describing. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about. Ask a question Due to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of Omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected]. April 25, 2022 Key takeaways: New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. Cases are rising in the eastern United States , but deaths are not. Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. , Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. Still unknown if lockdowns will prevent an Omicron surge in China. Low vaccination among the 80+ population could result in a huge death toll if an outbreak occurs. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Lockdowns and Omicron in China This week from IHME, we have not rerun our models. We have been spending time trying to understand the epidemic province by province in China. The key thing there as the outbreak continues to unfold in Shanghai with very broad-based transmission, is now reports of lockdown are confirmed by mobility data in many other cities within China. It remains to be seen whether the zero-COVID strategy will work to keep COVID, or the Omicron variant, from spreading very widely in China. What we do know is that vaccine coverage in the 80+ population in many provinces is quite low. If Omicron spreads widely, there is a real risk that what we saw in Hong Kong could re-occur in mainland China. That's something that we are watching very closely. Currently, our models are assuming that the success that China's had with the zero-COVID strategy controlling Omicron in February, around the time of the Olympics, could be replicated, but we're also hearing reports that the economic costs of this are rising. Cases on the rise in eastern United States For the United States, we're seeing rising case numbers in a number of eastern states. There's some suggestion of rising case numbers in other states as well. There has not been a precipitous rise in case numbers yet \u2013 this increase looks to be related to continued relaxation of behavior, combined with the BA.2 sub-variant. The good news there is we're not seeing an increase in deaths. But it does point out how critical in the US \u2013 and pretty much everywhere \u2013 access to antivirals is going to be. New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges While there continues to be a lot of discussion about access to vaccines in low- and middle-income countries and even discussion around boosters, there's perhaps not enough focus on making sure that people who need these highly effective antivirals like Paxlovid [can get them] in the future. This is somewhat important right now for the BA.2 sub-variant, but could be extremely important in the future as we imagine that there will be more infectious and potentially more severe variants that emerge during the course of this year. We have started to do some modeling of what would happen if a variant that was as severe as Delta came along with the transmission potential of Omicron, and in that setting, widespread access to an antiviral like Paxlovid really makes a profound difference in saving lives around the world. So a very high priority, both in the US and everywhere in the world, for thinking about health system delivery strategies and access to the drug itself, is that those who can benefit from an antiviral are going to get that antiviral. Expect more from us in the coming weeks as we continue to track the pandemic and try to model out how future scenarios unfold, both with what we know is currently occurring, but also potentially the emergence of new variants. Emergence of new sub-variants The last comment is on the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants in South Africa. They are replacing BA.2 and there is some increase in case numbers, but still modest so far, as distinct from what happened with BA.2. We're now four months or more into the peak of Omicron transmission, so some of that increase in BA.4 and BA.5 could be from waning immunity from what was established through the early Omicron wave in November and December in South Africa. But it\u2019s clearly another facet of the epidemic that will bear close monitoring. April 14, 2022 - Update from Dr. Ali Mokdad Key takeaways: BA.2 surge is ending in Europe. Cases are expected to continue declining in the Northern Hemisphere until next winter. Cases are expected to continue declining in the Northern Hemisphere until next winter. Omicron in China: With only 2% of the population previously infected and 30% immune from vaccination, a large surge is expected if lockdown and strict control measures fail. With only 2% of the population previously infected and 30% immune from vaccination, a large surge is expected if lockdown and strict control measures fail. BA.2 in the US: Some states are seeing a small rise in cases, but high levels of immunity due to previous infection (76%) are preventing a large surge. Some states are seeing a small rise in cases, but high levels of immunity due to previous infection (76%) are preventing a large surge. Mask wearing is below 25% \u2013 the lowest since we began tracking. \u2013 the lowest since we began tracking. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative. Policy recommendations: Secure and distribute antiviral medications. Maintain surveillance systems to detect new variants. For those who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors: continue wearing a mask and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Cases are declining in Europe Globally, we are seeing a decline in reported cases in the majority of countries, and the short surge that has happened after the Omicron surge in some European countries is declining. So we see a decline in reported cases right now in the UK, in Germany, in France. In the long run, we believe that the number of cases will keep declining all the way to next winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Surge predicted in China if precautions fail: only 30% of population currently immune The situation we are monitoring closely right now is what\u2019s happening in China. We believe the strict measures and the lockdown in China have been successful so far in containing the spread of the virus, but with Omicron being extremely contagious and spreading much faster than any previous variant we have encountered, we don\u2019t believe that China could contain the spread of Omicron for a long time. So we\u2019re expecting a rise of infections, reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in China if these measures that are in place right now are not successful in containing the spread of the virus. The reason we believe that for China \u2013 if you look at measures that China put in place, they were so effective at preventing infection. Right now in China, about 2% of the public has been infected by COVID-19 since the beginning of COVID-19, compared to 76% of us here in the United States. So we have more immunity than people in China, we have better vaccines with mRNA, and we have a higher vaccination rate, especially among the elderly population. Not for the general population, but for the elderly population in the United States we have a higher vaccination coverage. So when you put all of these together, in the United States we have about 73% of the public that is immune to Omicron, compared to 32% in China. So any outbreak in China, simply because there are about 70% of the public in China that are susceptible to Omicron, we expect a rapid surge of cases, similar to what we are seeing in Hong Kong and in other countries as well. Mobility is increasing, while mask wearing and testing decline More countries are relaxing their mandates right now \u2013 for example, New Zealand and Australia opened their borders to each other and travel is allowed right now. This could have an impact on reported cases as people are traveling and feel they are free to travel right now. Mask wearing is the lowest since we started reporting on mask wearing and since IHME started promoting mask wearing and providing scenarios showing how effective masks are in preventing mortality. So we're at less than 25% right now when it comes to mask wearing \u2013 it varies by countries, but mask wearing has dropped a lot because many countries relaxed their mask mandates, especially in Europe. Testing is declining in many countries: for example, in the UK, they're not paying anymore for testing, so we're seeing a decline in testing. That will impact our ability to track the pandemic in many countries and many locations. Some countries and states have decided to release data on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis, so the quality of data, the timeliness of data has changed, and that will impact our ability to track \u2013 not only us, but other groups who are doing similar projections \u2013 our ability to track the pandemic moving forward. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative Globally, there is a need to secure more antiviral medication and make sure it is available to every country to save lives and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals and protect the medical system. In countries where we see a surge of cases, recommending people to wear a mask and observe physical distance will be important. And in many countries in the world, it's very important to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, especially those who are not yet vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised and have health conditions. Our data right now show that a small percentage of people globally who want to get a vaccine or are willing to take the vaccine have not been able to receive the vaccine. The majority are in Africa. Therefore, it's very important to share vaccines with countries where people are willing to take the vaccine and they're waiting to get their vaccine. This is the only way for all of us to save lives and stop the spread of the virus, and of course we're not safe until all of us are safe. In the United States, the BA.2 variant is causing small rise in cases, but no surge expected In the US, we are seeing a slight rise in reported cases in some states, but we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in some European countries here in the US, simply because in the United States we have more immunity due to higher rates of previous infections in the country. BA.2 right now is the main circulating variant here in the United States \u2013 about 86% of the variants that are circulating in the US are BA.2. But because of previous infections in the US and our immunity, we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in Europe. The extension of the mask mandate on public transportation at the federal level and on airplanes will help a lot, especially right now with spring break vacations and people traveling. Many families are traveling for the first time with their children right now since the start of the pandemic, so one would expect, with the increased mobility and the fact that mask wearing is less than 25% in the US, that we'll see a slight increase in reported cases in the United States. We still believe that the pandemic phase of COVID-19 is over, simply because we have higher infections here in the United States and hence higher immunity. We are improving our vaccine and we soon should be able to have vaccines that are designed for the new variants; the vaccines that we have right now are highly effective, but we need to remember they were designed for the [ancestral] variant. And of course we have antiviral medications that will save lives and prevent hospitalization. If there is a surge from an escape variant, we can always go back to physical distancing and mask mandates and ask the public to wear a high-quality mask and avoid large gatherings. Recommendations for controlling the virus in the US The recommendations in the United States to contain the virus and the epidemic of this virus in the country remain the same: secure antiviral medications, distribute them, make sure patients can access them in a short time to save lives and prevent overwhelming our hospitals; maintain our surveillance system and also our genetic sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the US and, if there is a rise in cases, where it's happening and among whom, especially if they are vaccinated or not, so we can tell as soon as possible if the new variant is an escape variant and the vaccines are not as effective against it. For the public who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors, they need to remain more vigilant and wear a mask, especially if they are in close indoor settings with a large crowd. And all of us, if there is a surge and a new variant that is circulating, we also need to put our masks back on and make sure we maintain a physical and safe distance in order to reduce the chance of getting this virus. In the short term, the coming few months in the United States, IHME is projecting a decline after this tiny little surge, a decline of cases all the way until next winter, short of a new variant appearing. But we are projecting a decline in the number of cases all the way until next winter. April 8, 2022 Key takeaways: New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge. Provinces continue zero-Covid strategy, adhering to strict lockdown measures whenever there is an outbreak. By incorporating lower mobility into our model, we no longer see a massive surge in the forecasts for the coming months. Provinces continue zero-Covid strategy, adhering to strict lockdown measures whenever there is an outbreak.

BA.2 is declining in Europe and is not expected to cause a major surge in the US. Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. and is not expected to cause a major surge in the US. Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. Access to antivirals should be the primary focus of global efforts, shifting from previous emphasis on vaccination. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.2 is on the decline in Europe In this week's update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, first, the main findings that we see in the data and in our forecasts are that the BA.2 secondary surge of Omicron that has affected a number of countries in Europe appears to have peaked and is on the decline in almost all locations in Europe. Not all \u2013 there is some question about whether the United Kingdom has peaked and that the decline in cases may be due to access to testing since the tests now have to be paid for. But generally, we are seeing the peak and probably the decline of BA.2 in Europe. We do not expect a major BA.2 surge in the US In the United States, we have yet to see a BA.2 surge. There are some states where we're seeing hospitalization admissions go up slightly but not seeing the reported cases go up. So it may be that there's a small increase coming in some states. Our models for both Europe and the US do not suggest \u2013 at least for the US, we don't expect a major BA.2 surge, and in Europe we expect the surges to peak and decline. New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge The biggest factor in the analysis is the change in our results for China. We had been predicting for quite some time that Omicron would break out into the community and that China would choose to stop using a zero-Covid strategy, or what they call dynamic lockdown. But, given the rather stringent measures put in place in Shanghai, we don't expect, at least until the fall, that the Chinese government is going to step back from its zero-Covid strategy. We've used in the forecasts the observed reduction in mobility based on Baidu data for Shanghai and then assumed that whenever there is an outbreak in each province in China that there will be stringent measures put in place. So we've put substantial brakes on transmission that way through reduction in mobility in our modeling framework. This means that we don't predict a massive surge. We expect that will come later in the year. But we do see quite a number of deaths, given the quite low vaccination rates in the 80+ population in China that have become apparent. We must shift global focus from vaccination access to antivirals The expected trajectory in China does point to a very important role in the current Omicron wave, but more importantly for future new variants as they emerge, in access to antivirals. We see a lot of global discourse about access to vaccination, and that's certainly an important issue in terms of equity \u2013 everybody who wants a vaccine should be able to obtain a vaccine. But in terms of preventing death from future new variants, we think that the scale-up of antivirals, particularly the highly effective Paxlovid \u2013 but if other antivirals come along that are as effective, then those as well \u2013 is going to be the critical issue between a new variant, let's say that's more severe than Omicron, causing considerable mortality versus causing 80-90% less mortality. We will be producing, in the near future, antiviral scale-up scenarios to go alongside vaccination, booster, and mask use scenarios that we routinely produce as part of our periodic assessment of the pandemic. Those are the main findings. Likelihood of BA.2 surge depends on countries\u2019 levels of previous infection In other parts of the world, we're not seeing any evidence of a BA.2 secondary surge, even in places like South Africa where most of the transmission is currently BA.2. This difference across countries may well have to do with population-level immunity, how much prior infection, how much the first Omicron wave infected people. In places where there was a lot of transmission, there's probably enough immunity that we won't see much of a BA.2-related hump. Those are the main observations as we look around the world in our assessment of the pandemic. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about.

The wave was driven largely by the spread of BA.2, changing behavior following the removal of mandates, and waning immunity. The wave was driven largely by the spread of BA.2, changing behavior following the removal of mandates, and waning immunity. We do not expect a BA.2 wave in the US due to high rates of previous infections from Omicron. A surge next winter is still anticipated, and those over 50 years old should get a fourth vaccine dose to protect themselves. due to high rates of previous infections from Omicron. A surge next winter is still anticipated, and those over 50 years old should get a fourth vaccine dose to protect themselves. China continues to keep Omicron at bay , but we predict the surge will come by the end of May. To reduce mortality rates, we recommend: Scaling up production of mRNA vaccines Prioritizing vaccination of the elderly Preparing hospitals by increasing supply of antivirals , but we predict the surge will come by the end of May. To reduce mortality rates, we recommend: Policy recommendation: the US should begin planning for a winter surge including: Securing antiviral medication Planning distribution of antivirals based on risk factors and age Anticipating the potential need for another vaccine dose the US should begin planning for a winter surge including: Vaccine donations are still needed, but only if they have a long shelf life. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Cases are predicted to decline in the US The reported cases in our estimated infections are decreasing in the United States, and we project this trend will continue all the way to next winter. Our long-term projections for the United States show a rise in cases next winter but a small bump in some states, similar to what we are seeing right now in Europe. But in general in the US, we project a decline that will continue all the way until next winter. What we need to do in the United States is to remain vigilant, of course. COVID-19 is not over; the pandemic phase of it is over. We need to be very careful, especially those who have a risk factor or are immunocompromised. Fourth vaccine dose recommended for those aged 50+ The FDA has approved a fourth dose for people who are above 50. It\u2019s very important for all of us who are above 50, including myself, to go and get number four. It will help a lot in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, especially if you have received your second dose or your third dose more than five months ago. Why is Europe seeing a second wave, and will the same happen in the US? As far as what\u2019s happening in Europe, we know that the second wave in Europe after the peak of Omicron was due to BA.2 spreading, change of behavior, and waning immunity. In the United States, because we have higher infection compared to Europe \u2013 for example, compared to the UK \u2013 we have lower vaccination but more infections. With the combination of the two, we have more immunity in the United States, especially in the Southern states, where they had more infections than we\u2019ve seen in the UK. So we will not expect a big bump in the US. There may be a very minor one in some states, but a decline overall. What the US needs to do is to secure more antiviral medication and keep it and distribute it right now to places ahead of the next surge. And make sure we have a plan for distribution based on risk factors and the aging of the population in each location, but also to have a plan for redistribution in case we have a wave in one state and medication sitting in a warehouse in another state. So, shifting resources is very important for preparedness. We believe that before winter, because of waning immunity, another shot may be needed as well, depending on whether people have received four or three doses. Still, in the US, vaccination is not increasing, and unfortunately we have leveled at about 65% at the national level. Risk of cruises and other activities varies by personal factors CDC has announced that it's ok to get on a cruise ship. I believe it's safe, in my opinion, if you are vaccinated and boosted, and now if you are above 50 and getting the fourth dose. But of course, for all of us, whatever we do from now on has to be based on our own personal risk and the risk of people we live with or we are around. So basically, for somebody who\u2019s young and healthy, the risk is very minimal to get Omicron or BA.2, but for somebody who's older in age, has a risk factor, or is immunocompromised, the risk is much higher. Of course, we have to behave accordingly to protect ourselves and the people we live with and we care about. That's very important. The BA.2 wave is coming to an end in Europe As far as the global landscape, what we are seeing right now in Europe and many countries, the second peak has happened, and it's starting to come down \u2013 in the UK, for example. It\u2019s still going up in France as of today, coming down in the Netherlands, so in many European countries, that second peak lasted about 3-4 weeks and came down. This was driven mainly by BA.2 and the change of behavior. In Europe, they had more mandates than we did here in the United States, and then there was a sudden change of behavior, more so than in some states here in the United States where we didn't have any mandates, Florida for example. So basically, the behavioral change that has happened after the peak of Omicron is minimal in the United States compared to what we've seen in Europe. China continues to keep Omicron at bay China is the country that we are keeping an eye on right now. China so far has been able to contain the spread of Omicron in Beijing by lockdown and massive testing. Whether they will be able to do so and maintain that control in Shanghai and other large cities is a big question mark. BA.2 and Omicron are more infectious, so we believe the chances of containing the spread of Omicron in China will be very limited. Our long-term projections in China show that they will have a major surge coming up with a peak in May, towards the end of May, with a large number of hospitalizations and mortality, for several reasons. China has a high vaccination rate, but their vaccine is not as effective as the vaccines we are using here in the United States or in European countries. So what China needs to do is \u2013 and we know they have right now received the permit to produce mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, and they have their own mRNA vaccine being developed right now \u2013 so producing more vaccines and vaccinating people, especially the elderly in China, because we know there are reports that vaccination among the elderly is very low compared to what we have seen in other countries. Second, is to produce more antivirals, and we know that they have right now licenses to produce antiviral medication and distribute it in China. Preparing their hospitals for the surge is very important right now. Vaccine donations are still appreciated, but only if they have a long shelf life Vaccine donations have saved a lot of lives all over the world, and countries have been generous in providing extra doses of vaccines to others who need it. It's very important to remember as you donate these vaccines to make sure they have a long shelf life. They shouldn't be about to expire. Once you give a vaccine to a country, there are a lot of logistics and distributions and manpower that's needed to administer these vaccines. Indonesia, for example, has asked all donors, please when you give us a vaccine let's make sure it has a long shelf life. We need to keep that in mind and not waste vaccines. Thank you everybody for donating the vaccine, but let's make sure the vaccine can be used by the country that is receiving them in time before they expire. March 21, 2022 Key takeaways: Four zones of Covid transmission in the world Majority of countries: transmission continues to decline Western Europe: secondary increase in transmission from BA.2 Southeast Asia: peak Omicron wave China: not yet experienced an Omicron wave, but we anticipate it will arrive in the next few months, causing up to a million deaths BA.2: Countries that have already dealt with BA.2 transmission (Netherlands, Denmark) saw brief surges that ended reasonably quickly. That pattern may spread to the rest of Western Europe and North America. Increased transmission is likely due to a combination of BA.2 and reduced mask use and social distancing. Ukraine: there will likely be increased transmission due to the ongoing war and crowded conditions, but the impact may be reduced because of high levels of prior immunity in the population. Policy recommendation: We should shift focus away from vaccination and towards production and distribution of anti-virals like Paxlovid. Can reduce death rate by 90% More likely to maintain effectiveness against new variants that may come in the future This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity In this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first thing to recognize is that there are really four zones of Covid transmission right now in the world. In the vast majority of countries, transmission continues to decline, as countries come off the peaks of Omicron transmission. Western Europe is experiencing a second wave in transmission from BA.2 As there has been quite a bit of media attention, there is a secondary increase in transmission in some countries in Western Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Greece, are places where transmission is on the increase. That increase is being attributed to the substitution of the BA.2 variant for the BA.1 variant, combined with reduced mask use and social distancing. We don't think it's just BA.2, because BA.2 has actually been around for quite some time. In fact, for example in South Africa, it appeared in December. It's replaced BA.1 but there's been no substantial increase in community level transmission. We don't think \u2013 and you see this in our forecasts \u2013 that this combination of BA.2 and reduced caution about transmission will lead to a prolonged secondary surge. The reason is the surge in the Netherlands \u2013 it went up, then came back up, and now the secondary surge has already peaked and is on its way down. In Denmark, the BA.1 and BA.2 parts sort of coalesced into one and that also came to an end reasonably quickly. We think that will be the pattern that we'll see in other countries in Western Europe, and it's possible that pattern will spread to the United States and Canada as well. Southeast Asia is in peak Omicron wave The third zone are those countries still in the main upswing, or peak levels of transmission due to a delayed Omicron wave. Those are mostly in Southeast Asia \u2013 Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples of that. And then the biggest driver of transmission, cases, and potentially deaths, is what's playing out in the zero-Covid strategy countries, so New Zealand looks to have hit their peak on Omicron, but it's coming down quite slowly. China has not yet seen an Omicron wave And then the big, big question is China. Because we've seen in an immunologically naive population with not good vaccination coverage in the elderly, quite a toll in Hong Kong. And now the question is when and if that will spread to mainland China. There are outbreaks in multiple cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other locations. The Chinese government is still pursuing the strategy of lockdown for a short period and then multiple rounds of mass testing to identify all cases and then quarantine them. This worked in Beijing in February to stop transmission and they are trying to pursue this for now, but the economic consequences are very great and there's greater calls within the Chinese leadership for less of a stringent policy. We predict next wave in China could be devastating Our model foresees that that can't go on for that long and so we have a huge peak, with perhaps as many as a million deaths in China coming through in April, May, and into June. The timing of that will depend critically on how the Chinese government chooses to either relax or not their zero-Covid strategy. The other key issue that could mitigate the huge death toll that could be coming in China is the recent announcement of an IP waiver from Pfizer for Paxlovid for producers in 22 countries, including five producers in China. So there's an interesting strategic choice that will play out, which is that the balance of the economic harm of the aggressive zero-Covid strategy and creating time to produce anti-virals that would be sufficient to protect some of the unvaccinated elderly within China. The timing and how that plays out is going to be up to the policy choices in China. The importance of anti-virals If we step back and zoom out more globally, there's still a tremendous amount of energy in trying to address vaccine inequality and addressing supply constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa around vaccination. That's certainly well-justified on moral grounds \u2013 everybody should have access to vaccination who wants it \u2013 but may not have a huge effect on death and hospitalization. We see in the data in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, that cumulative infection rates are quite high \u2013 80-90% of most countries have already been infected, they have immunity from infection, and also vaccine hesitancy is quite high. So even if the supply constraints are addressed \u2013 which they should be, on moral grounds \u2013 we should not expect that to make a huge effect on this 6-month timeframe of hospitalizations and death rates. However, what we don't see is similar international energy on the crucial issue of access to anti-virals, because anti-virals like Paxlovid can reduce the death rate by 90% and production capacity is small. With the new IP waivers going to India and China and some other countries, perhaps we can have a more concerted global effort in giving access to everybody who needs it, particularly the elderly, to anti-virals. That could really change the course of Covid over the next 12 months. The other aspect of the anti-virals scale-up that is important to recognize is that we don't really know if current vaccines will do much for future variants. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, particularly transmission, has been quite low with current vaccines. Whereas we suspect that the pathway that the anti-virals use will stay preserved and so the anti-virals will be an effective strategy irrespective of the type of variants that may come. So, as we step out and go into this phase where it's very unlikely that we'll see mandates and social distancing mandates as a main strategy for control. Then it's really down to vaccination and anti-virals. We've had lots of push on vaccination, and now we need equal policy attention and drive on the anti-virals. Covid in Ukraine Lastly, of course there is a real interest and attention on what might be the consequences on Covid of the war in Ukraine. Very difficult to assess, because of course the information systems have fallen apart amid the setting of the incredible destruction and invasion that is underway. But, one aspect of it that may mean the effect of millions of refugees crowding, lack of opportunities to social distance, may not be as bad as it might have been, is that despite low vaccination rates in the Ukraine, they have very high levels of prior infection, so there is quite a substantial amount of immunity. Of course, there will be increased transmission. We probably won't get any data about it, but hopefully the impact will be much less than if they had been a truly immunologically naive population. March 4, 2022 - COVID-19 impact on women's equality Presented by Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou Key takeaways: The pandemic has disproportionately affected women in terms of employment & income loss, gender-based violence, and returning to school. Policy action : Governments should incentivize girls going back to school and prioritize the areas of life most affected in their region. Read the research article. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity It's really important, as we move past the latest wave of Omicron deaths and infections, to pay a lot of attention to the other areas of life and society that the pandemic has had a big pull on. In our study, we measured the impacts of the pandemic on some of these areas, particularly on employment and education, on income loss, on foregoing utilizing other health care for one\u2019s needs, and particularly how those may have disproportionately affected women compared to men around the world. As the world moves on to the next phase, it is really important to consider all other aspects of life that the pandemic has had a big impact on, not only the direct effects on deaths and infections that we have been living with over the past two years. The pandemic has disproportionately affected women when it comes to employment loss, to income loss, to increased perceptions of gender-based violence, and also with regard to education and who is returning to school compared to who is dropping out of school. Read \u00bbCOVID-19 Led to Worse Social and Economic Consequences for Women published in Think Global Health Even though there are a lot of areas that the pandemic has affected, our findings only scratch the surface of what the real impact of the pandemic may have been, as we have only been able to explore a few of these areas. But we think that the impact of the pandemic has been broad and is going to be felt for years to come. It has been widely discussed that the effect of the pandemic on schools and on education is very profound. Sadly, we have very little data to measure what is happening right now to the millions of learners around the world, but from what we know, we are quite concerned that as societies and schools go back to normal, girls will be returning to education at a lower rate compared to boys. This happened after previous crises, and there are some indications that it is happening again as a result of COVID school closures. It is really important that societies and governments prioritize incentivizing girls going back to school and returning to education now that schools are reopening again. Our study is the first study that has taken a comprehensive lens to the impact of the pandemic on gender disparities. While we have not answered all the questions, we\u2019re hoping that policymakers will look at the most important areas of society and life that have been affected by COVID with respect to gender disparities in their own country, and prioritize what they should be addressing first. In some regions of the world, the most severe impact has been felt on employment loss; in other regions of the world, education should be prioritized. We\u2019re hoping that our study will contribute information needed as we move to the next phase of life and COVID-19, to prioritize the areas where the gender gaps are most pronounced and most severe. February 17, 2022 Key takeaways: COVID anomalies: Cases on the rise: Russian Federation and Belarus Cases declining faster than expected: the Caribbean and South America Cases increasing again after a decline: Finland, Sardinia, Canada (Manitoba province) China: Omicron wave has not yet hit, but we expect that will change by March or April. Functional immunity: We\u2019re updating the model to reflect patterns in immunity from vaccination, previous infection from Omicron, or previous infection from other variants. United States: About \u00be of the population is currently immune to Omicron. What does the future hold? We expect there to be intensified transmission next winter and more variants will likely emerge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Where cases have continued to rise This week\u2019s update from IHME on modeling and analyzing the COVID epidemic: First, in terms of what\u2019s happened around the world that is not following the trajectory that we expected, the only major observation on that front is that the increase in cases in the Russian Federation and perhaps Belarus has continued to rise. We expected because we\u2019ve estimated past infection levels to be very high, they should have run out of people to infect, but they\u2019ve kept going. So we expect that peak should come soon, but of course the fact that it has kept going may imply that levels of past infection have not been as high as we\u2019ve previously expected. Where cases are declining faster than expected The second observation is that the Omicron wave is going down faster in some regions than we expected, or somewhat faster. The Caribbean stands out \u2013 actually South America in general stands out \u2013 in declining faster than perhaps we expected. Where cases are increasing again after a decline There are a handful of anomalies that we are observing around countries where after a decline, cases have gone back up. Finland is included in that, Sardinia would be in that group, Manitoba province in Canada. In each of these, we\u2019re not sure what the explanation is \u2013 could be a local phenomenon around increased transmission or spatial spread. In the case of Finland, it may be the same thing that happened in Denmark \u2013 the spread of the BA.2 variant. But certainly, these are not happening in a large number of locations and seem to be specific to those particular places. The situation in China Our global numbers do look different because of China, where we expected that by now the Omicron epidemic would have taken hold more broadly in the community and we would be seeing widespread transmission. The public health authorities in China, through vigorous lockdowns, have been able to stop transmission in Beijing. We are therefore pushing out later into March and April what we continue to expect will happen \u2013 which is that there will be a widespread Omicron wave. At the global level, that makes a difference. How we\u2019re factoring in functional immunity The last thing to note is that as part of our analyses, we are going to be including what\u2019s in the models for quite some time: the fraction of people in each population that have got functional immunity to Omicron. That immunity comes from vaccination, even though vaccines are only partially effective for blocking Omicron infection; it comes from past infection with other variants; and it comes from infection with Omicron. In each case, we compute that functional immunity, taking into account the pattern of waning for vaccination and for natural infection, and the cross-variant immunity, or the breakthrough that Omicron has against prior variant infection. When you put all that together, in a place like for example the United States, we see about three-fourths of the population currently are immune to Omicron. We expect that number will continue to grow as we go through this tail-end of the Omicron wave in the United States. Does that mean that so many people are immune to Omicron that we will see no further transmission or waves of COVID in the future? The answer is no, because we will have \u2013 if no new variant emerges \u2013 we would expect Omicron to return next winter. There will be more waning of immunity, more people will have gone back to being susceptible, and we\u2019d be back into winter intensified transmission. Of course, we do think variants will emerge, and so further increases or outbreaks are likely as the new variants emerge that have immune escape and can infect people who are currently immune to Omicron. We don\u2019t expect those new variants, however, to have the same consequence that the Delta variant had last year. Because global levels of immunity are going to be much higher and there\u2019s the advent of access, which we hope will eventually be global, to antivirals, which will substantially reduce the infection-fatality rate. Those are the main insights from this week\u2019s analysis. February 10, 2022 - Q&A with Dr. Murray Key takeaways: Incorporating incidental COVID deaths into the model is still a work in progress : We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track. : We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track. Our model's performance has been quite good: We have continuously modified the model to take into account new factors like vaccination, variants, and waning immunity. We have continuously modified the model to take into account new factors like vaccination, variants, and waning immunity. Removing mask mandates makes sense in places where Omicron infections are on the downswing. The mandates have little effect when most people have already been infected. The mandates have little effect when most people have already been infected. It will be difficult for zero-COVID countries, like China, to keep Omicron at bay. The new variant is so transmissible that even lockdowns will not hold it off for long. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity How will your model account for incidental COVID deaths? We know from a variety of community-level studies \u2013 hospital pre-admission screenings, some cohort studies in India, the ONS [UK Office for National Statistics] infection survey \u2013 that Omicron comes with a very high prevalence in the community, as high as 10% or 12% of the population shedding virus at any one time. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the incidental hospital admissions and deaths. The challenge as we dig into this is jurisdiction. By jurisdiction, the way incidental admissions and deaths are being counted appears to be different. And so, at present, we're not able to understand this difference for every jurisdiction. We are starting to compile the data as provided, or the guidance as provided, by each jurisdiction, but since we track nearly 400 different jurisdictions, counting the subnational units in many countries, it's going to be quite a task for us to fully understand this. But it's a work in progress. How has IHME\u2019s approach to COVID-19 forecasting changed? The IHME approach to modeling the epidemic has kept progressing as the epidemic unfolded. Our very first model in March of 2020 was really driven by the experience observed in Wuhan and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions there on transmission. We then transitioned to a transmission dynamics model with other drivers, mask use, mobility, testing, and a bunch of contextual factors such as smoking, air pollution, and altitude, population density, and a variety of other factors. And then we had to modify the model to take into account vaccination, and then the spread of variants with the emergence of the Alpha variant. And then finally, the big change that's come in the last few months has been taking into account waning of infection-acquired immunity and waning of vaccine-acquired immunity. We're trying to keep abreast of what the virus is showing us and the complexity of what's happening around the world. I think part of the reason that our out-of-sample predictability or model performance has continued to be quite good is because we are trying to essentially keep up with the virus while we learn about it. What will be the consequences of removing mask mandates? Right now, in countries where Omicron is subsiding, there's a pretty rapid move to lift mandates. We're seeing it in some US states, Canadian provinces, many countries in Europe, and discussion elsewhere of similar moves. I think removing the mandates makes sense in settings where we think that most people who are susceptible to Omicron have been infected and the numbers are coming down because we've run out of people to infect. In those settings, the mandates aren't really achieving much at all. And so there should be little to no risk in removing those mandates. In settings, which we don't see a lot of, where there is a lot of behavioral modification, people are avoiding contact, mobility has come way down, and mask use has gone up, then perhaps some of the peaks in Omicron may have been before all the people who are susceptible have been infected \u2013 and then you might get a secondary resurgence if you take the mandates off. But there are not many places where the other data on mobility and mask use would suggest that that's really the driver of the peak, in which case we think removing the mandates will have little to no impact on transmission once you're on the downswing of Omicron. Should China relax its restrictions, and what will happen if it does? The big question with Omicron is what do zero-COVID countries, most importantly China, do? And it's really quite a challenge because we worry most about people who are unvaccinated and never infected, so essentially there's almost nobody in China who's been infected, except a very small percentage of the population from the original outbreak. And you have quite high vaccination rates, but the vaccine isn't particularly effective against Omicron. It's much worse efficacy than say Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca. The challenge that the Chinese government has is how to manage this situation. If there's a strategy ahead where they can deliver a more effective vaccine booster to the over-65s and under-65s with comorbidities \u2013 the vulnerable group \u2013 or they can gain access to intellectual property around antivirals and start producing enough antivirals to start producing a big caseload, then that becomes a way out. You keep up with the rolling lockdowns in each place where an Omicron outbreak occurs until you're ready with those other strategies. But if there isn't going to be that strategy, then continuous rolling lockdown \u2013 because we expect Omicron will just keep reemerging because it's so infectious \u2013 probably becomes infeasible. Right now, that choice on strategy is probably what the Chinese leadership is trying to figure out. We",

Homes and property of more than 2 000 people were damaged. Total damage was estimated at around 65 million yuan ($9.6 million).1 During the late spring and early summer, a semi-permanent frontal boundary \u2013 known locally as mei-yu or baiu front (plum rains) \u2013 emerges across eastern China, Taiwan, and Japan, leading to prolonged periods of heavy rain and thunderstorms which frequently cause damage. The front stretches from the Tibetan Plateau to Japan along a confluent jet stream that separates Arctic circulation to the north from tropical circulation to the south. Along this boundary, mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) or mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) tend to form and propagate eastward, giving a series of heavy downpours.2 References: 1 Tornado kills 1 in eastern China as country faces high temps \u2013 AP \u2013 July 21, 2022 2 Mei-yu front \u2013 AMS \u2013 Accessed July 20, 2022 Featured image credit: Eric Wang If you value what we do here, create your ad-free account and support our journalism.

        "link":"https:\/\/watchers.news\/2022\/05\/23\/swarm-mission-discovers-interannual-waves-in-earths-core\/",
        "text":"Using information from ESA\u2019s Swarm satellite mission, scientists have discovered a completely new type of magnetic wave that sweeps across the outermost part of Earth\u2019s outer core every seven years and propagates westward at up to 1 500 km (932 miles) a year. The discovery offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth\u2019s core. Since the trio of Swarm satellites was launched in 2013, scientists have been analyzing their data to gain new insight into many of Earth\u2019s natural processes, from space weather to the physics and dynamics of Earth\u2019s stormy heart. Measuring our magnetic field from space is the only real way of probing deep down to Earth\u2019s core. Seismology and mineral physics provide information about the material properties of the core, but they do not shed any light on the dynamo-generating motion of the liquid outer core. But now, using data from the Swarm mission, scientists have unearthed a hidden secret. \u201cGeophysicists have long theorized over the existence of such waves, but they were thought to take place over much longer time scales than our research has shown,\u201d said lead author Nicolas Gillet from the University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes. \u201cMeasurements of the magnetic field from instruments based on the surface of Earth suggested that there was some kind of wave action, but we needed the global coverage offered by measurements from space to reveal what is actually going on. \u201cWe combined satellite measurements from Swarm, and also from the earlier German Champ mission and Danish \u00d8rsted mission, with a computer model of the geodynamo to explain what the ground-based data had thrown up \u2013 and this led to our discovery.\u201d Owing to Earth\u2019s rotation, these waves align in columns along the axis of rotation. The motion and magnetic field changes associated with these waves are strongest near the equatorial region of the core. While the research exhibits magneto-Coriolis waves near a seven-year period, the question of the existence of such waves that would oscillate at different periods, however, remains. \u201cMagnetic waves are likely to be triggered by disturbances deep within the Earth\u2019s fluid core, possibly related to buoyancy plumes. Each wave is specified by its period and typical length-scale, and the period depends on characteristics of the forces at play. For magneto-Coriolis waves, the period is indicative of the intensity of the magnetic field within the core,\u201d Gillet added. \u201cOur research suggests that other such waves are likely to exist, probably with longer periods \u2013 but their discovery relies on more research.\u201d \u201cThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earth\u2019s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earth\u2019s thermal history,\u201d said Ilias Daras, ESA\u2019s Swarm mission scientist.

Social scientists began noticing anti-fat attitudes that went beyond these programs into other aspects of entertainment media. America, it seemed, was ready to battle the bulge. Obesity rates, however, haven\u2019t declined in the past two decades. Americans continue to gain weight each year and a new study finds that younger adults are one of the most susceptible groups. Expanding Waistlines In the past two decades, obesity rates in the U.S. have increased from 30.5 percent of adults in 1999 to 41.9 percent of adults in 2020. Severe obesity has almost doubled from 4.7 to 9.2 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For young people, the COVID-19 pandemic only made the situation worse. One study by the CDC looked at body mass index rates (BMI) of more than 430,000 kids and teens between 2018 and 2020. During the first seven months after the pandemic started, the increases in monthly BMI rates nearly doubled. Kids and teens who were overweight or obese prior to the pandemic had higher weight increases and averaged a gain between one to 1.2 pounds per month. Weight gain at such a rate would result in a six-month total between 6.1 and 7.3 pounds. In contrast, kids at a healthy weight put on an average of 2.7 pounds during the same time period. The epidemiologists involved in the study had several explanations for the pandemic weight gain. Kids and teens were suddenly cut off from school, and they had to deal with the stresses of trying to learn at home. Gym class, sports practices and games were all canceled. At the same time, they had less exercise, they also had increased screen time. And like their parents, many kids and teens also turned to unhealthy comfort foods during the lockdowns. Pandemic stresses helped explain why many kids (and many adults) gained weight in 2020. A nationwide study published in 2022 found that almost half of U.S. adults reported gaining weight after the pandemic started. But a longitudinal study has found that American adults have been steadily gaining weight in the past decade \u2014 well before the terms \u201clockdown\u201d or \u201csocial distancing\u201d had entered the lexicon. A Slow Build A study published in May 2022 in the Journal of Obesity analyzed data for more than 13,000 adults from the years 2011-2018. The authors intended a decade-long analysis that ran from 2011 to 2020, but data from the last two years were unavailable because of what they referred to as \u201cissues due to COVID.\u201d After analyzing the information and seeing how different demographics fared, the study found that people gained weight gradually. From one year to the next, most people didn\u2019t have a sudden spike in weight. Most people, however, did gain weight each year. By the end of the study, 51 percent of people in the sample gained at least five percent of their body weight. Of those who put on pounds, more than 35 percent gained at least 10 percent of their body weight. A person who weighed in at 200 pounds in 2011, for example, went up to 220 by 2018. Sixteen percent of the sample gained 20 percent of their body weight or more, meaning a person who stepped on the scale in 2011 at 200 pounds found themselves at 240 by 2018. As a group, the adults in the analysis had a BMI increase from a mean of 28.2 to 29.7. But when the study\u2019s authors looked at different demographics, they found the weight gain was not even. Some groups were more susceptible to weight gain than others. Not Slowing Down One of the biggest takeaways of the study was that women gained double the amount of weight as men. The average pound increase was 12 pounds for women and 6 pounds for men. The authors were also surprised by the age when people in the sample started to gain weight. Instead of staying slim as younger adults and then putting on pounds in middle age, younger people had the highest weight gain. On average, people gained 17 pounds between their 20s and 30s; 14.3 pounds between their 30s and 40s; and 9.5 pounds between their 40s and 50s. People in their 70s had the smallest weight gain, averaging around 2 pounds. The authors also noted sharp distinctions among different races, affecting people of color disproportionately. Among the groupings in the study, non-Hispanic Black adults gained the most weight, and Black women saw the highest gain of 19.4 pounds. The least affected group in the study, non-Hispanic Asian men, gained an average of 2.9 pounds. The study\u2019s authors stressed that obesity is a serious problem in the adult population, particularly among younger adults, women and non-Hispanic Black people. They also concluded that knowing which groups were more susceptible could improve intervention programs. The groups identified in the study, however, make up most of the U.S. population, an indicator that the obesity epidemic is not slowing down.",

        "text":"Disclaimer: This article contains affiliate links to products. We may receive a commission for purchases made through these links. If it\u2019s your first time trying delta 8, chances are that you have all sorts of questions. You may be wondering how the cannabinoid interacts with the brain, what the high feels like, and how long the high lasts. You may also be wondering how delta 8 will make you feel and what product will provide the best experience. Since the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law, hemp and hemp-derivatives were legalized at the federal level (although state laws may differ so it's always best to check before ordering). With continued advances in the industry, there\u2019s modern technology that allows delta 8 to be extracted from hemp plants. Delta 8 is one of the best cannabinoids to try if you\u2019re interested in a natural compound that has similar effects of cannabis without the need to buy marijuana. If you want to learn the ins and outs of delta 8, including what the high feels like and how long it lasts, you\u2019ve come to the right place. How Delta 8 interacts with the brain Delta 8 THC is very similar to delta 9 THC. The only difference is the molecular structure, which impacts how the compound interacts in the body. While both activate the CB1 and CB2 receptors of the endocannabinoid system, the effects aren\u2019t the same. CB2 receptors deal with the physiological responses to cannabinoids when they\u2019re introduced into the body. On the other hand, interactions with the CB1 receptors are what cause a psychoactive experience, better known as \u201cthe high.\u201d However, because delta 8 doesn\u2019t interact as strongly with CB1 receptors, the high is much less intense when compared to delta 9. Delta 9 is more likely to overstimulate CB1 receptors, which can cause anxiety and even paranoia. What does the Delta 8 high feel like? While everyone reacts differently to delta 8, there are some things you can expect after taking a tincture or chewing a gummy infused with the compound. When taking delta 8, you can expect things like: Relaxation and tranquility A feeling of euphoria Uplifted mood Increased body awareness Others who have taken delta 8 have also reported that the cannabinoid makes them feel calm, mellow, and relaxed. You may even find that delta 8 improves focus and energy, making you more productive throughout the day. While there\u2019s still a lot to learn about delta 8, research indicates that the compound has appetite-stimulating, antiemetic, anxiolytic, and even neuroprotective properties. This means that delta 8 can be used to reduce nausea, vomiting, and pain. It can also help to restore a healthy appetite and to protect cells and tissue in the brain. As discussed earlier, taking delta 8 will cause you to experience intoxicating effects. But, the effects won\u2019t make you incapacitated. Most people are able to take delta 8 and continue performing their everyday tasks. However, when trying delta 8 for the first time, it\u2019s important to do so in a safe space. You don\u2019t want to be at work or driving when taking a delta 8 product for the first time. It\u2019s best to be at home so that you can experience the high while ensuring you\u2019re taking a safe, reasonable amount. Does Delta 8 have side effects? For most people, the delta 8 high is mellow and relaxing. However, this assumes that the user is taking a moderate amount. Taking too much delta 8 can cause a wide range of side effects. The good news is that they\u2019re mostly mild and are rarely dangerous or life-threatening. Some of the most common side effects associated with consuming too much delta 8 include: Dry mouth Red eyes Dizziness Increased heart rate Fatigue Impaired coordination Reduced motor control Inability to fall asleep Confusion and\/or paranoia If you experience any of these side effects, it\u2019s best to stop using delta 8 altogether. Once you resume usage, lower the dosage, which greatly minimizes the risk. If you\u2019re a new delta 8 user, it\u2019s best to start with a small amount and slowly increase the dose until you find your sweet spot. How long does the Delta 8 high last? While the high from delta 8 takes longer to kick in when compared to other cannabinoids, the effects tend to last much longer. The onset and duration depends on several variables, including the dosage and consumption method. Also, your tolerance levels can play a role. If you\u2019ve used delta 8 or delta 9 in the past, you may have a high tolerance to THC altogether. This likely means that you\u2019ll need a higher dose to experience the full effects of the compound. What should first time delta 8 users know? Caution is a must when trying delta 8 for the first time. A new user is anyone who has never tried cannabis or any form of THC. As with any new product, low and slow dosing is best. Ideally, new users should start with a 5 or 10 mg dose. The amount can be slowly increased until you find a dose that gives you the delta 8 experience that you want. Trial and error is the only way to figure out your sweet spot. Though it can be tempting, don\u2019t make the mistake of taking a high dose as a new user. Doing so greatly increases the risk of experiencing all of the bad side effects that will have the opposite effect than what you originally sought. What\u2019s the best way to try Delta 8? There are many different ways to experience delta 8. At the end of the day, it comes down to your personal preference and what you\u2019re looking to get from the compound. As delta 8 continues to grow in popularity, there\u2019s a growing number of products available on the market. While delta 8 sourced from hemp plants is legal, it\u2019s important to note that there are plenty of illegal products that have made it onto store shelves and online stores. This is why it\u2019s so important to only use delta 8 products from a brand that you can trust.

This way you can ease into the high without overdoing it. Taking too much delta 8 greatly increases the risk of negative side effects. Remember, too much of a good thing can turn bad! However, it\u2019s important to note that a product\u2019s safety is highly dependent on how it\u2019s manufactured. Because the industry lacks oversight and regulation, there\u2019s always the risk that a product could be advertised as being safe, even if it isn\u2019t tested and confirmed by a third-party lab. This is why you only want to buy delta 8 products from a brand that you can trust. Each of the 10 companies that we highlighted above provide safe, high quality products that will offer the experience that you want. Whether you want to use delta 8 for pain relief or to give you an uplifted mood, your experience all comes down to the quality of the product. Since safety should be your main concern, buying from a reputable company is a must. How long does delta 8 stay in your system? Now that you know the ins and outs of what the delta 8 high feels like and how long it lasts, you may be wondering how long the compound stays in your system. While there isn\u2019t much research to scientifically confirm how long delta 8 stays in your system after ingestion, it\u2019s thought that the time is quite similar to delta 9. Generally, THC remains in the blood for up to 36 hours after ingestion and in the saliva for up to 48 hours. For some people, THC remains detectable for up to a month, if not longer! Will delta 8 show up on a drug test? If you are subject to regular drug testing by your employer, you\u2019ll want to steer clear of delta 8 products. Chances are that delta 8 will show up on a drug test. This is because standard drug test panels check for THC metabolites, compounds that aren\u2019t just specific to delta 9. There are various factors, such as metabolism and body fat percentage, which impact the body\u2019s ability to completely process, metabolize, and remove all traces of delta 8 THC. For some, delta 8 can remain detectable in their urine for a month or more after ingestion. The more frequently you use delta 8, the longer it will take to be completely eliminated from your body. This means that a new user who tries delta 8 for the first time will have THC-free urine much sooner than a frequent user. Final thoughts Making the decision to try delta 8 THC can be life-changing. Whether you\u2019re using the cannabinoid for pain relief, to get better sleep, or to improve your mood and focus, delta 8 provides a smooth, mellow high without the overwhelming psychoactive effects of delta 9 THC. What\u2019s most important is that you ease your way into the world of delta 8. If you\u2019re a new user, be sure to start with a low dose and slowly increase the amount. Low and slow dosing greatly minimizes the risk of unintended side effects that will put a serious damper on your experience. Now that you know how delta 8 works, how long the high lasts, and some of the top products to try, you\u2019re well on your way to beginning your journey!",

        "title":"You Have COVID-19, Is It Really Safe to Only Isolate for 5 Days? checked by Nick Blackmer",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/covid-peak-infectiousness-isolation-5216463",
        "text":"Key Takeaways Evidence from over 100 studies shows that COVID-19 contagiousness in those with the virus peaks around symptom onset and rapidly declines within a week. Rapid antigen tests will likely only return a positive result during the period of infectiousness, meaning a negative result following recovery from symptoms may indicate you're no longer contagious. Omicron has a shorter incubation period than other variants, between two to four days. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in December issued new isolation guidance for those infected with COVID-19, reducing the quarantine period from 10 days to five days. The agency said that research has shown transmission occurs early in the course of infection. Health professionals have expressed mixed opinions on the guidance. Some were concerned that reducing the isolation period could be accelerating the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. According to research cited by the CDC, COVID-19 infectiousness generally peaks the day before symptom onset. In addition, a negative antigen test may indicate that the period of infectiousness has ended. Verywell Health \/ Julia Ingram When Will Symptoms Appear? Compared to previous variants, Omicron reportedly has a shorter incubation period\u2014around two to four days\u2014meaning symptoms will develop faster after exposure. In one study of an Omicron outbreak in Oslo, Norway, following a Christmas party in November, researchers found that symptoms began in 45% of the 80 confirmed or probable cases three days after the party. In a study of a similar outbreak in South Korea, the median observed incubation period was slightly longer, at 4.2 days. But symptom onset doesn\u2019t always coincide with infectiousness. Over 20% of transmission can be attributed to individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic (one to two days before symptom onset). When Is Someone Most Contagious During a COVID-19 Infection? The CDC cited a 2020 review of 113 studies done in 17 countries with evidence that COVID-19 viral load peaks around the time of symptom onset. Reviewers concluded that the full period of contagiousness ranges from two to three days before and eight days after symptom onset. This means people infected with COVID-19 are most contagious when they start experiencing symptoms, with the potential for transmission declining rapidly after that and disappearing after eight days. Jin Su Song, MD, MPH, DTMH, an infectious disease specialist working at Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said his team observed Omicron contagiousness disappearing completely after 10 days. The current isolation guidance in South Korea is 10 days. \u201cWe can\u2019t exactly know how long [infection] lasts,\u201d Song told Verywell. \u201cAccording to our research, and also our preliminary studies show that the duration of infection is probably equal or less than the wild-type virus or Delta virus.\u201d When Should You Test? If you were exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, it\u2019s wise to get tested two to four days after the exposure, given Omicron\u2019s incubation period. PCR tests have a lower threshold that can detect the virus before the period of infectiousness, making them more accurate for those who have been infected even if they were asymptomatic. Daniel Larremore, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said that while PCR tests remain the \u201cgold standard\u201d for clinical diagnosis, the delay may be a tradeoff that isn\u2019t worth the increased accuracy for a large-scale testing program. \u201cWith high demand, PCR tests are often delayed by a day or more, meaning that even though the PCR is more sensitive to detect early infections, that information comes back at a considerable delay, essentially wiping out most of the \u2018early warning\u2019 value that one might hope for,\u201d he wrote in an email to Verywell. If you take a PCR test, isolating before getting the results is important to prevent potential spread to others. The high-sensitivity of PCR tests means they may also show up positive in the post-infectious period, after one has recovered and is no longer contagious. So a negative antigen test and a positive PCR could mean you are about to be contagious, or are no longer contagious. In that case, the timing of exposure can help determine which phase a COVID-positive person is in. What This Means For You If you test positive, isolate until your symptoms subside or for 10 days. If you receive a negative rapid antigen test after five days, you are most likely no longer contagious and you may end the isolation as long as you wear a tight-fitting mask around others per the current CDC recommendation.

        "title":"Explainer: COVID-19 vaccine dosage",
        "link":"https:\/\/cosmosmagazine.com\/science\/explainer-covid-19-vaccine-dosage\/",
        "text":"As it stands, over 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Australia. This doesn\u2019t mean 4 million people are fully vaccinated \u2013 both of the vaccines currently approved for use in Australia require two doses to reach full immunity. As of the end of May, half a million Australians have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Additionally, some people who have received one vaccine dose have tested positive to COVID-19 in Melbourne this week. So why do these vaccines need two doses \u2013 and what\u2019s the logic behind the timing between doses? Why do we need two doses to be fully vaccinated? The aim of a vaccine is to provoke an immune response in the body. For lots of vaccines, the best way to do this is to provoke the immune system twice. \u201cWe call it prime, and boost,\u201d says Stephanie Gras, a professor of immunology and medical science at La Trobe University. \u201cYour first vaccination dose is your priming of the human system, so you\u2019re actually teaching your immune system to recognise this protein from the virus. \u201cThe second one is the boosting effect, where your immune system knows about it, but now you want your immune system to be really strong. That\u2019s why the two doses are really important.\u201d The number of antibodies is particularly important as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge. \u201cNew studies show that even if the Indian variant can spread faster, the current vaccines that we have in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) have strong efficacy against the variant and so people who are vaccinated are protected,\u201d says Gras. \u201cThe data show that even if the antibody levels are decreased due to the variation in the virus, the vaccine still provides a strong level of protection. It is also important to note that other immune cells such as the killer T cells are very good at recognising different variants and protecting us.\u201d At the moment, all approved mRNA vaccines require two doses, and so do most COVID-19 vaccines that use other methods. Why do some vaccines only require one dose? The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is being used in some countries (like the US), only requires one dose to be effective. Interestingly, it uses the same method as the AstraZeneca vaccine to provoke immunity: an adenovirus vector, containing spike proteins from COVID-19. Gras says that while different vaccines may use the same technique, they\u2019re made by different companies and tested in separate trials, so they\u2019ll still have different ingredients. This means they\u2019ll provoke different levels of immune response. \u201cEven if some of them are based on the same platform and the technology behind is the same, they\u2019re actually not the same vaccine,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re making a chocolate cake. At the end it\u2019s going to be a good chocolate cake, but every chef has a different recipe.\u201d Does one dose of a two-dose vaccine protect me from COVID-19? Yes, but not as much as two doses \u2013 and the level of protection depends on both the vaccine being used and the variant of SARS-CoV-2. \u201cThe vaccine provides protection after two weeks of your first injection,\u201d says Gras. \u201cThe thing is that the level of protection is different between the vaccines. Get an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox. Get a daily dose of science Get \u201cCosmos Catch-up\u201d (every Tuesday) \u201cSomething also to keep in mind is that all the vaccines have been developed against the Wuhan strain of the virus.\u201d Variants \u2013 such as the B1.617 strain currently in Melbourne \u2013 have different resistance to vaccines. For instance, a study with over a million participants in Israel found that the Pfizer vaccine was 46% effective at preventing COVID-19, 14 to 20 days after the first dose. Over the study period, around 80% of infections in Israel were due to the B1.1.7 strain first detected in the UK. (In this study, the vaccine was shown to be 92% effective after the second dose.) The strain currently in the Melbourne community is newer, but one dose of a vaccine is still likely to have some effect \u2013 although two doses is much more effective. Gras says that after one dose, the Pfizer vaccine efficacy is \u201cactually down to about 30% for the Indian variant, which could explain why we may have some people who are able to have COVID, even if they have been vaccinated.\u201d \u201cIf they\u2019ve been vaccinated just a few days before catching the virus, that probably won\u2019t give enough time to the immune system to actually build a response,\u201d she adds. \u201cReports from the UK also show that the effectiveness of one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca is only 33% against B1.617.2; but this rises to 88% after two doses for Pfizer and 59.8% after two doses of AstraZeneca,\u201d says Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute of the University of NSW. \u201cThe good thing is that after the second dose, the vaccines are really efficacious against the variant,\u201d says Gras. How long is the wait between doses? The type of vaccine informs the time required between doses. \u201cSome vaccines will stimulate the immune system to react fast,\u201d says Gras. \u201cAnd for some of them, over a longer period of time you will build a stronger immune system for the vaccine, which means you can actually delay the second dose.\u201d For the Pfizer vaccine, the second dose should be given about 21 days, or three weeks, after the first. Clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine used this approximate interval, and found it highly effective. The AstraZeneca vaccine has a longer and more flexible timeframe for its second dose. According to the Health Department\u2019s website, AstraZeneca\u2019s second dose can be given 4\u201312 weeks after the first dose. A number of studies have shown that it will be safe and effective anywhere in that timeframe. ATAGI, which guides the government on the vaccine rollout, has recommended that the AstraZeneca vaccine be given 12 weeks apart. This will \u201censure the most effective clinical protection and maximise broader community coverage.\u201d You can learn more about ATAGI in our Cosmos Weekly article. Subscribe to read the full piece. Because supplies are limited, one of the priorities of the rollout is to get more people partially vaccinated rather than a few people fully vaccinated. This means preference has been given to space AstraZeneca doses at the maximum 12 weeks apart, rather than four, because then more people can have time to receive their first dose. \u201cIf this interval is not possible, for example because of imminent travel, cancer chemotherapy, major elective surgery, a minimum interval of four weeks between doses can be used,\u201d notes the TGA on their website. Can I mix vaccines? Could you get one dose of Pfizer, and one of AstraZeneca? We published a longer explainer on mixing doses recently, and we recommend you read that for more information. The short answer: there\u2019s some early evidence from overseas suggesting that mixing vaccines is okay, but it\u2019s certainly not approved or recommended by Australian health authorities yet. It\u2019s unlikely anyone in Australia will have the opportunity to try this, anytime soon. As always, you should chat to your doctor if you have any personal health concerns or questions.",

Cheng and her colleagues took blood samples from 2479 people who worked at or were registered at a medical centre in Los Angeles. At least two samples were taken per participant. The first was drawn before 15 December 2021, shortly before the area experienced a surge in covid-19 infections driven by the omicron variant. Advertisement Subsequent samples were taken between 15 December 2021 and 4 May 2022, during which time omicron became the dominant variant and several subvariants, such as BA.4 and BA.5, emerged. Of the participants, 210 were found to have had covid-19 between the first time their blood was taken and subsequent samples, based on levels of coronavirus-specific antibodies in their blood. To ensure this antibody response wasn\u2019t induced via vaccination \u2013 94 per cent of the 210 participants had received at least one vaccine dose \u2013 the researchers specifically looked at the participants\u2019 IgG-N levels.

Of the participants who didn\u2019t know they had omicron, one in 10 (10 per cent) said they had experienced mild symptoms but attributed them to other infections, such as the common cold.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.the-scientist.com\/news-opinion\/how-covid-19-affects-pregnancy-70369",
        "text":"ABOVE: \u00a9 ISTOCK.COM, ELENABS Early in the pandemic, maternal-fetal health specialists had to confront the fact that there were no easy answers they could give their patients regarding how COVID-19 might affect their pregnancies. Dani Dumitriu, a physician-scientist affiliated with Columbia University in New York, recalls that the university\u2019s Irving Medical Center was the first hospital in the country to admit a pregnant woman with COVID-19, and as a result, \u201cwe at Columbia felt a great responsibility, being that we were the first epicenter, to generate knowledge very rapidly.\u201d Early questions centered around very basic aspects of the disease, including whether pregnancy increases the risk of getting sicker or dying from the virus and if it was possible to transmit the virus to a fetus in utero or to an infant through breastfeeding. When parents-to-be first began showing up to the hospital, some of them critically ill, \u201cthere was really only a little bit of literature from China\u201d addressing questions like these, Dumitriu says, \u201cand we didn\u2019t know how much it would translate\u201d to the local patient population. Vertical transmission is not the be all and end all, and there\u2019s many more subtle impacts that can happen on the developing fetus. \u2014Andrea Edlow, Massachusetts General Hospital Years into the pandemic, some of these questions have now been answered, while others are still being fleshed out. The physical and immunological changes that take place during pregnancy do appear to make pregnant people more susceptible to severe disease, pregnancy complications such as preterm birth or miscarriages, and death. And as cohorts of children born during the pandemic pass major developmental milestones, researchers are beginning to identify possible long-term effects to SARS-CoV-2 exposure in utero. Looking back on 2020, \u201cwe know a lot more than we did then,\u201d Dumitriu tells The Scientist. \u201cBut there are still a lot of answers we\u2019re working towards.\u201d How pregnancy ups the risks that come with COVID-19 During pregnancy, the body undergoes a series of drastic physical and immunological changes to accommodate a growing fetus, and some of these changes increase vulnerability to respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. For example, pregnant people produce more blood than normal in order to sustain the placenta. To pump that blood around, cardiovascular output can increase by as much as 40 percent, leaving them more vulnerable to heart attack, arrythmias, and heart failure\u2014conditions that overlap with COVID-19 complications. And as the fetus grows, the uterus pushes against the diaphragm, making it difficult to draw deep breaths or to cough forcefully\u2014this is why pregnant people are generally at a higher risk for developing pneumonia, and another possible reason why COVID-19 might hit them more severely. There are also immune changes that take place throughout pregnancy to avoid an inflammatory response to the fetus and placenta. These changes take place in three phases linked to the trimesters\u2014a so-called pregnancy immune clock\u2014meaning that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can manifest differently depending on the timing, according to Massachusetts General Hospital maternal-fetal medicine specialist Andrea Edlow. But even with these broad overarching changes to the immune landscape, Edlow notes that \u201cthere\u2019s not a universal truth that any trimester of pregnancy looks the same for every pregnant individual.\u201d Studies during the pandemic have routinely shown that pregnant people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at higher risk for severe disease, death, and complications such as preeclampsia, miscarriages, and preterm birth compared to those without the disease, particularly when parents were infected later in their pregnancies. Like others in their age group, most infected pregnant people report asymptomatic or mild cases of the disease, but pregnant people who are admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 are more likely than their peers to spend time in the ICU and to require invasive ventilation. This has been true worldwide, with studies from China, Israel, the UK, the US, sub-Saharan Africa, and international consortiums all reporting the same broad trends (with regional differences). In pregnancy, as in the broader pandemic, minority racial and ethnic groups are more likely to experience these adverse outcomes. As new variants have replaced older ones, these patterns have largely held. The data are still rolling in, especially for Omicron, but the preliminary consensus is that variants have resulted in more cases and sometimes, but not always, caused more severe illness than their predecessors, with Edlow calling Delta in particular a \u201cworse actor.\u201d In one study, scientists found that infections in pregnant people when Delta predominated were more severe than those during the Alpha wave of late 2020, leading to more incidences of pneumonia, more cases that required respiratory support, and more ICU admissions. Another paper, published in JAMA earlier this year and based on admissions to a prenatal health network in Texas during the Delta and Omicron surges, found that three times as many pregnant people tested positive for COVID-19 during the Delta surge, and 10 times as many during the Omicron surge, than during a pre-Delta period of the pandemic. Compared to the pre-Delta period, Omicron cases were about 80 percent less likely to be severe in terms of the need for interventions such as supplemental oxygen or intubation, while Delta cases were three times more likely to be severe. With respect to pregnancy complications, severe cases of COVID-19 have been linked to placental abnormalities, preeclampsia, early miscarriages, stillbirths, and preterm births. In one study, women infected with SARS-CoV-2 later in pregnancy (after 34 weeks) were seven times more likely to report a preterm birth, while in another, which included over 1 million women, a COVID-19 infection was two times as likely to be associated with a stillbirth, regardless of the trimester of infection. Pregnant people who contract COVID-19 are also two times as likely to develop preeclampsia, which can be fatal. To explain these findings, several researchers have probed the mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the maternal-fetal interface, a specialized tissue derived from the uterus and placenta, to influence disease. An early study published by Edlow and her colleagues, for example, found that evidence of vertical transmission\u2014that is, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus across the womb\u2014is extremely rare, limited to just a handful of cases. However, she adds, \u201cvertical transmission is not the be all and end all, and there\u2019s many more subtle impacts that can happen on the developing fetus.\u201d Cells in a placenta infected with SARS-CoV-2 (red) COURTESY OF DRUCILLA ROBERTS Ilhem Messaoudi, an immunologist at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine who specializes in viral diseases and maternal-fetal health, recently investigated these other effects, looking specifically at asymptomatic or mild infections. While her sample size was relatively small\u2014just nine pregnant women with COVID-19 and 15 uninfected controls\u2014she found that even mild infections can have a lasting effect on the maternal-fetal interface. Months after their first positive test, the women\u2019s immune response remained shifted toward a proinflammatory state, with an increased abundance of memory T cells and a reduction in immune-suppressing regulatory T cells in the mother\u2019s blood as well as an uptick in cytokine-secreting macrophages in maternally derived placental tissue, which was collected at birth. \u201cWhen I initially started these studies, I had this naive view that somehow the placenta was this protected organ that was made out of Kevlar or something, but clearly it\u2019s not,\u201d Messaoudi says. \u201cThese changes occur, they reverberate through the maternal-fetal interface, and they persist. And anytime you talk about enhanced inflammation . . . that is not without a consequence. Being bombarded by inflammation in utero is going to have a cost down the line.\u201d Specifically, she says she wants to know whether that exposure remodels the fetus\u2019s immune system during development such that it could change how these infants respond to childhood vaccinations. The years to come Some babies born during the pandemic have since celebrated their first and even second birthdays, and researchers are following these children to see whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to neurodevelopmental delays after birth. Based on previous disease outbreaks, scientists know that a viral challenge during pregnancy can sometimes lead to lifelong effects for the child. Cohort studies following the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 1957, for example, found that people born during the outbreaks attained lower education levels and had higher rates of schizophrenia. A rubella pandemic in 1964 was associated with a 10- to 15-fold increase in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Roy Perlis, the director of the Center for Quantitative Health at Massachusetts General Hospital, recently published the results of a study assessing the neurodevelopmental outcomes at one year of age among hundreds of infants born in 2020 to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 during their pregnancies. His team, of which Edlow is a part, found that maternal infection was associated with a greater incidence of diagnoses of disorders related to speech, language, and motor function, even when race, ethnicity, insurance status, offspring sex, maternal age, and preterm status were accounted for. The hopeful caveat, Perlis tells The Scientist, is that these are \u201cnonspecific diagnoses,\u201d meaning that \u201cin many cases, they resolve on their own and don\u2019t have any implications for the longer term. On the other hand, that\u2019s not always the case.\u201d When Columbia\u2019s Dumitriu looked into this same question in a cohort of six-month-old infants using a standard risk screening questionnaire, she failed to find evidence of impaired neurodevelopment following maternal exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The group has since developed an observational assessment of babies for use over Zoom, and has shared preliminary evidence at conferences that Dumitriu says \u201creinforces this lack of an effect of COVID infection during pregnancy on neurodevelopment.\u201d This virus just continually surprises people this far into the pandemic, and we don\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s coming around the corner. \u2014Dani Dumitriu, Columbia University Perlis says that he isn\u2019t particularly surprised by the differences between the two studies. The two papers used different metrics to assess delays\u2014one based on risk and the other on actual diagnoses\u2014and it may also be that six months is too early to capture many missed milestones. \u201cWe need to look at this question in different ways, and so all of the various approaches to understanding it are valuable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea was always for [our study] to be the first of a series of reports that will expand as the cohort grows and as these kids get older.\u201d The two teams will soon assess their respective cohorts\u2019 risk for autism spectrum disorder, and later, for conditions such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia\u2014links that took decades to become clear after past pandemics. Although Dumitriu didn\u2019t find an effect of COVID-19 exposure in her cohort, she did find an unexpected result when, as she was preparing to publish her initial findings, she approached one of her team members about including a group of pre-pandemic children in the analysis. Shortly after, her colleague called her in a panic, Dumitriu recalls. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t breathe on the phone. I had to calm her down.\u201d The new work showed that, compared with children born before 2020, all of the pandemic babies, regardless of their SARS-CoV-2 exposure status, scored significantly lower on gross and fine motor skills and personal-social interactions, suggesting that something about being born into and growing up during the pandemic was creating an increased risk for missing developmental milestones. \u201cOn the heels of having this really incredibly good news when we were expecting a viral infection effect, it was very surprising,\u201d says Dumitriu, who attributes the differences between pre- and post-pandemic babies to the effects of maternal stress. Her current work aims to tease apart how exactly that stress manifests and what it might mean for maternal and fetal health. Multiple researchers stress that even as we learn more about the interplay between COVID-19 and pregnancy, there\u2019s no space to let our guard down. New strains appear to be more transmissible, and if a future variant were to also induce higher incidences of severe disease, it could be especially troublesome for pregnant individuals. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop investing in this research, [and] we can\u2019t stop being vigilant,\u201d Dumitriu says. \u201cThis virus just continually surprises people this far into the pandemic, and we don\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s coming around the corner.\u201d",

        "text":"Ana Teresa Freitas, PhD Professor, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST) University of Lisbon CEO and Co-founder, HeartGenetics, Genetics and Biotechnology, Lisbon Ana Teresa Freitas transformed her personal health challenges into an opportunity when an unclear diagnosis motivated her to embark on a new research trajectory. Freitas realized that the algorithms she was using in her electronic and computer engineering work were applicable to the analysis of regulatory gene networks. As professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Lisbon and CEO of HeartGenetics, she now uses algorithms to explore the human genome and identify genetic data that inform disease prevention. In a recent Scientific Reports study, Freitas and her colleagues took a unique approach to understanding the genetics of immune response variability to SARS-CoV-2.1 They defined polygenic risk scores\u2014a predictor of disease that uses an algorithm to assess genetic variability\u2014for previously identified polymorphisms in genes involved in vitamin D synthesis, metabolism, and downstream pathways. Freitas and her team compared these polygenic risk scores to serum vitamin D levels and COVID-19 disease severity in almost 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Portugal. They identified certain polymorphisms in the GC gene, which encodes vitamin D-binding protein, as risk biomarkers for vitamin D deficiency and found a correlation between these variables and COVID-19 severity. How did the idea for this work arise? My team and I developed MyNutriGenes, a genetic test that analyzes genetic predisposition to metabolic syndrome using polygenic risk scores and informs preventive strategies. This test includes an analysis of the genes associated with vitamin D pathways. After more than 9,000 exams, we realized that the Portuguese population had genetic characteristics that predispose them to vitamin D deficiency, which may account for why almost 70% of our population is vitamin D deficient. At the onset of the pandemic, I discussed this topic with Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Calhau. We decided to examine the association between polygenic risk scores for polymorphisms in vitamin D-related genes, vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 severity, based on previous evidence of an association between vitamin D status and COVID-19 mortality rates.2 A higher prevalence of the DHCR7 RS12785878 variant [of the GC gene] in Portuguese versus Europeans likely contributes to the observed prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. What are possible applications of this work? This work highlights the important role of serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D-binding protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection and has implications for novel SARS-CoV-2 biomarker discovery. Vitamin D levels and the GC gene variant described in this paper can be included as part of a composite score for predicting COVID-19 severity, along with other candidate biomarkers. It would be interesting to compare the predictive power of a genetic score with that of a more complex multi-parameter score, comprising both genetic3 and non-genetic markers using a larger dataset for validation. This research can also be applied to the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease mechanisms. It is known that neutrophils are abundantly recruited in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but this may not be beneficial to the host. Vitamin D-binding protein acts as a neutrophil chemotactic factor, and genetic variation in its encoding gene impacts COVID-19 outcomes. Therefore, this work stresses the need to further explore the role of neutrophils in SARS-CoV-2 infection to understand whether modulating these immune cells could improve outcomes. In general, the immune response depends on the concerted action of several types of cells. In this study, a gene that would not be considered the first choice in the context of immunity (GC) showed an association with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was already some evidence of its importance in immune response and this study reinforced this association, in this case regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this gene should be explored in future studies, to assess the existence of other variants associated with variability in immune response and, also, to explore the underlying mechanisms by means of functional studies. How might this study shape future clinical practice? Broadly speaking, this study demonstrates the practical application of preventive genetics for viral diseases. An individual\u2019s access to information about their own genetic predispositions enables a personalized approach to disease prevention and treatment, which in this case may include increased sunlight exposure or a specific supplementation plan to address vitamin D deficiency. Several European countries, including Ireland and Spain, are already taking preventative measures by defining supplementation programs for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.4,5 This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

        "text":"ABOVE: Artist\u2019s rendition of BA.2.75 \u00a9 ISTOCK.COM, UDOMKARN CHITKUL The Omicron subvariant BA.2.75, also dubbed Centaurus\u2014seemingly because some guy on Twitter decided it should be\u2014continues to drive up the number of COVID-19 cases in India, where it was first detected in May. There, the subvariant seems to have some sort of competitive advantage over BA.5, the subvariant largely responsible for the latest ongoing wave of coronavirus infections around the world, Catholic University of Leuven evolutionary biologist Tom Wenseleers tells Nature. The BA.2.75 subvariant has also made its way to over 20 other countries, including several in the Americas and Europe. Still, experts are mixed on how much of a threat it will pose to the rest of the world amidst and in the wake of the BA.5 surge, the outlet reports. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly growing pretty well in India, but India hasn\u2019t got much BA.5, and it is still very unclear how well it fares against [that],\u201d Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, told The Guardian last month. Like other Omicron subvariants, BA.2.75 is more infectious and better at evading the human immune system\u2014both vaccine- and infection-induced protections alike\u2014than earlier variants of concern. Though data are still limited, researchers have determined that the subvariant carries nine mutations on its spike proteins. \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the virus that sticks out and binds to the host cell receptor, and those mutations allow the virus to bind to that receptor more efficiently,\u201d Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, explains in a press release. Experts are reluctant to sound the alarm, however, as the wave of BA.5 infections may reduce the number or severity of cases attributed to BA.2.75. Both subvariants seem to have descended from the earlier Omicron subvariant BA.2, and thus their genetic similarities may leave the immune system primed to fend off one after defeating an infection of the other. Omicron subvariants BA.5 and BA.2.75 are closely related, raising the possibility that the immune response to an infection of one may prevent someone from catching the other. MODIFIED FROM COVARIANTS.ORG ; DATA FROM NEXTSTRAIN This seems borne out by the low rates of BA.2.75 cases in countries to which it has spread that have already experienced or are currently experiencing a surge of BA.5 infections. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to a point where these variants are sort of competing with each other and they\u2019re almost equivalent,\u201d Shahid Jameel, a University of Oxford virologist who led India\u2019s coronavirus sequencing efforts, tells Nature. \u201cI think people who have had BA.5 will not have a breakthrough [infection] with BA.2.75, and vice versa.\u201d Meanwhile, the BA.2.75 surge in India may potentially stem from greater local protections against BA.5, which could exist because the variant shares mutations with the Delta variant that exploded in the country in 2021, Nature reports, though that and other explanations for the subvariant\u2019s disparate spread remain speculative until more data roll in. As the BA.5 wave ends and protections against the subvariant eventually fade away, it\u2019s unclear what will take its place as the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2, experts tell Nature. It\u2019s possible that an even newer subvariant, BA.4.6, which is currently spreading in Europe and North America, will outcompete BA 2.75 to succeed BA.5, or that the two subvariants will each become a problem in different countries, Nature reports.",

        "text":"Paris, the capital of France, is awash with history; it's home to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre , the world's most-visited museum (opens in new tab). Yet, despite the city's wealth of cultural hotspots, architectural delights and superb restaurants (it currently has over 90 Michelin one-star (opens in new tab) eateries) some tourists find themselves unable to enjoy a trip to Paris. A small percentage of those who venture to The City of Light experience \"Paris syndrome,\" a psychological condition with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate. But what, exactly, is Paris syndrome? Who tends to be affected by it, and why? Though not indexed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Paris syndrome is recognized by many experts as a real, though rare, phenomenon. According to Mathieu Deflem, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina, Paris syndrome is \"most common among Japanese\" tourists. Why, then, are Japanese people so susceptible? \"We are talking about a culture that, historically, had a completely different belief system and development trajectory from places in Europe,\" Rodanthi Tzanelli, a professor of cultural sociology at the University of Leeds in the U.K., told Live Science. These cultural differences, as well as likely unmet romantic expectations, may explain why Japanese visitors are at an elevated risk for Paris syndrome. Related: Did Marie Antoinette really say 'Let them eat cake'? Nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate are all symptoms of Paris syndrome. (Image credit: Shutterstock) Paris syndrome should be regarded as an extreme form of culture shock, Deflem said. Culture shock can, in particularly severe cases, result in people feeling disorientated, depressed, irritable and physically ill, according to the University of the Pacific in California (opens in new tab). \"Culture shock is an illness resulting from the loss of meaning brought about when people from one symbolic reality find themselves immersed in another,\" Rachel Irwin, now a cultural sciences researcher at Lund University in Sweden, wrote in a 2007 article (opens in new tab). In other words, people can become bewildered \u2014 sometimes to a significant degree \u2014 when surrounded by symbols (logos, names, signs, brands) that are different from those they would usually encounter. The symptoms associated with culture shock are similar to those experienced by someone who is feeling anxious. According to Calm Clinic (opens in new tab), a mental health resource website, when someone is experiencing anxiety, signals will be sent to the stomach that are \"related to the fight or flight response.\" As a result, the \"signals alter the way that the stomach and gut process and digest food, causing nausea.\" In particularly extreme cases of anxiety \u2014 as with culture shock \u2014 this nausea can lead to vomiting, disorientation and a host of other physical reactions. While everybody experiences culture shock \"in one form or another when visiting somewhere new,\" some people feel it in more pronounced and visceral ways when presented with a culture that is \"unexpected or nuanced,\" according to Deflem. With regard to Paris syndrome specifically, \"a number of factors are at work,\" Deflem told Live Science. \"It will be a combination of expectations from Japanese culture and the reality of Paris.\" Deflem noted that, generally speaking, Japanese culture has a somewhat romanticized view of the West, \"especially Europe.\" This, Deflem suggests, is largely down to how Paris is represented in films \u2014 such as \"Am\u00e9lie\" (Miramax Films, 2001), \"Before Sunset\" (Warner Independent Pictures, 2004) and \"An American in Paris\" (Loew's Inc., 1954) \u2014 and books \u2014 \"A Night at the Majestic\" (Faber and Faber, 2006), \"The Ladies' Delight\" (1883) and \"A Moveable Feast\" (Scribner Classic, 1964) \u2014 which tend to focus on art, coffee culture, quaint restaurants and cordial, intelligent conversation. He suggested that these expectations are \"not realistic, especially in Paris, which is not known for being hospitable.\" Indeed, a 2014 study carried out by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler (opens in new tab) named Paris the world's fourth most unfriendly city; a 2020 study by CEOWORLD magazine (opens in new tab) awarded Paris the title of rudest city in Europe; and a 2021 survey by InterNations (opens in new tab), an organization dedicated to helping people relocate, concluded that Paris is Europe's third-least-friendly city for expats.

Reality hits hard when visitors to Paris are forced to take off the rose-tinted glasses of which they've been viewing the city of romance. (Image credit: by-studio via Getty Images) In popular culture, \"Paris is presented in ways that do not reflect the realities of the city, especially not in recent times, when much of Paris is no longer the France of old,\" Deflem said. Additionally, Deflem highlighted that \"Japan, for example, has a very orderly and polite culture,\" while Parisian everyday life is less so \"despite its image,\" he said. \"Parisians can sometimes be guilty of looking down on people \u2014 even non-Parisian French \u2014 which is seldom seen in Japanese culture. The confrontation is sharp.\" According to Deflem, \"very subtle differences\" regarding cultural norms or societal expectations can cause confusion because \"it makes situations tricky to navigate.\" Such misunderstandings can be difficult for tourists because it is hard to know when a \"particular value is at play, when to apologize, when not to ask a question etc. Culture is complex.\" But could visitors to other cities experience similar feelings? Might someone exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with Paris syndrome in other historic cities, such as Vienna, New York or Beijing? Tzanelli thinks Paris syndrome may not be specific to the French capital. Rather, she regards it as \"a very complex psychic phenomenon that has to do with disappointment, even despair, about the ways reality does not match our romantic expectations.\" The syndrome is likely a \"generational phenomenon,\" because younger generations tend to be \"more globetrotting,\" and therefore are likely to be more prepared for what they will experience at a destination, she added. However, Tzanelli is keen to point out that nobody is immune to culture shock, regardless of their age or the amount they have traveled. \"We are creatures of habit,\" she said. \"We are inculcated into a particular way of life, adopt behaviors and habits from our surroundings, and become part of a culture and social group. We never think about these things, but habits, behaviors and values always work at the back of who we are and what we do. When we are suddenly taken out of this system of beliefs and habits, out of the ways we structure our life, we are left with no means to frame and define who we are.\" Tzanelli noted that, although she's well acquainted with culture shock and has studied it in detail, she is by no means immune to its effects. \"I've had this experience [of culture shock] even in places I had previously visited,\" she said. \"Time affects memory, and the stored images we have of places are bound to differ from reality.\" Originally published on Live Science.",

        "text":"(Image credit: Gilead) It has been more than 40 years since the first reported cases of HIV, and tremendous progress has been made toward ending the epidemic, including advances in HIV treatment that allow for longer and healthier lives. Nevertheless, HIV persists as a serious public health challenge. In the United States, the South accounts for eight of the top ten states and nine of the top ten metropolitan areas with the highest rates of new infections. Globally, it\u2019s estimated that more than 36 million people are living with HIV and 4000 individuals are newly infected each day, with the burden disproportionately faced by Sub-Saharan Africa and many low- and middle-income countries. Scaling up proven prevention interventions and strategies is essential to reduce the individual and societal burden of the virus. The HIV epidemic is not over. The work needed to overcome the epidemic includes an unequivocal commitment to continued scientific innovation to provide solutions for the unmet and evolving needs of people around the world. Scientific breakthroughs and medical innovations have brought radical change for people and communities most affected by HIV. The advent of antiretroviral therapy and once-daily single tablet regimens represent some of the most significant milestones that have helped bring radical change in the outlook for people affected by HIV. The scientific advancements have been transformative but significant gaps in care remain. Since the company was founded 35 years ago, Gilead has been a leading innovator in the field of HIV, driving advances in treatment, prevention, and cure research. Gilead researchers have developed 11 HIV medications, including the first single-tablet regimen to treat HIV and the first antiretroviral for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection. These scientific advancements have helped to transform HIV into a preventable disease and a chronic condition for the millions of people who are living with HIV. Last week many from the global HIV community convened in Montreal for the 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022). There, the latest advancements and discoveries in HIV science were discussed by many of the most respected researchers from around the globe. Gilead\u2019s decades of expertise and leadership in HIV uniquely position the company to develop innovative therapeutic options that address unmet needs in HIV treatment and prevention while actively pursuing research that could, one day, lead to a cure. Gilead\u2019s first guiding principle for advancing the next wave of transformational innovation in HIV is putting people at the center of the research and development process. A person-centered approach to innovation is of particular importance to Jared Baeten, MD, Ph.D., Gilead\u2019s Vice President of HIV Clinical Development. Under his leadership, the efforts of the HIV development team are driven by a strong sense of justice, equity, and dedication to ending the global epidemic. \u201cA person-centered approach to research results in the creation of clinical evidence that is meaningful and beneficial to people and communities confronting the day-to-day realities of this virus. Collaboration with researchers and community stakeholders, particularly those living with HIV or those who could benefit from PrEP, is integral in all aspects of our research development process. And, that kind of collaboration is essential if we are going to have the impact we all want, which is ending this epidemic,\u201d notes Baeten. \u201cRepeated and engaged opportunities to interact directly with the community, such as we were fortunate to do each day at AIDS 2022, are invaluable for helping further our HIV research efforts.\u201d (Image credit: Gilead) Against this backdrop, Gilead concentrates its research and development efforts on key areas: HIV Treatment and Prevention Research As part of global efforts to help end the HIV epidemic, Gilead understands the critical need for continuous innovation to bring forward novel solutions to meet the challenges of the epidemic today, striving for ground-breaking advancements. As the epidemic has evolved over four decades, new challenges continue to emerge. Although antiretroviral medications have transformed HIV into a treatable disease, Baeten believes the next wave of innovation in HIV is long-acting options that can help address the differentiated needs and preferences of the diverse range of individuals and communities affected by the epidemic. \u201cThose diverse, unmet needs propel our research teams at Gilead, and it is paramount this work is supported by the most rigorous clinical science.\u201d In addition, people with HIV have evolving needs as they age, and they require antiretroviral therapies that accommodate those needs. Those aging with HIV have several age-related chronic conditions and additional burden from the treatments they take for those other conditions. Chronic immune activation from the viral infection compounds these challenges. To confront the synergistic effects of aging with HIV, Gilead\u2019s treatment research program focuses on advancing long-term health and quality of life. Advancing the science behind PrEP is a fundamental part of Gilead\u2019s efforts aimed at ending the epidemic, and Gilead remains committed to developing novel patient-centered PrEP medication options. Understanding the needs and preferences of those who would benefit from PrEP and giving people choices that best fit their schedules \u2013 including long-acting dosing intervals \u2013 will be a key to accelerating the decline in new HIV infections worldwide. Every day, Gilead strives to incorporate the expertise of community members from around the world directly into the company\u2019s prevention clinical development work. HIV Cure Research : Curing HIV is the ultimate aspiration of Gilead\u2019s HIV research and development efforts. Through the company\u2019s innovative cure research program, Gilead is furthering the collective scientific knowledge on potential pathways to achieve a \u2018functional cure\u2019 (defined as long-term viral suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, without transmission or disease progression). Currently, Gilead is exploring a range of options to activate and eliminate the persistent viral reservoir that makes HIV a lifelong infection. The company\u2019s strategy is grounded in the hypothesis that a multi-pronged approach is needed to achieve the goal of curing HIV. The discovery and development of latency-reversing agents, immune modulators, and genetically engineered effector antibodies are core areas of focus in the company\u2019s research. Gilead has created a three-prong strategy for its research focus: pull HIV out of reservoirs, direct the immune system to clear it, and inoculate the body against any remaining virus, aiming at long-term remission. Illuminating the pathways to an HIV cure is an incredibly complex scientific challenge and partnerships and collaboration are key to catalysing the research. That\u2019s why Gilead works closely with industry, academic, and community partners on clinical studies to achieve a functional cure for HIV. \u201cOur close connections with the field, built over decades of collaborative research and development, enable us to advance multiple preclinical and clinical programs aimed at functional cure for HIV,\u201d said Baeten. As part of Gilead\u2019s cure grants program, more than $36 million in grants have been awarded to academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and community groups engaged in HIV cure initiatives. Gilead\u2019s work to develop a cure for HIV is one part of the company\u2019s larger role in the global efforts to help end the HIV epidemic and part of Gilead\u2019s focus on person-centric innovation. (Image credit: Gilead) \u201cContinued scientific innovation and inclusive approaches are essential in the discovery and development of person-centered options that address the evolving needs of a broad range of individuals and communities affected by HIV,\u201d underscored Baeten. \u201cOur scientific advancements are grounded in collaboration with community and research partners around the world. AIDS 2022 brought us back in-person with those partners, after two years of being unable to gather together. The time we spent highlighted how strong the need for continued innovation is, and further strengthened our belief that we will dedicate the time and resources to develop innovative new medicines that will draw us closer to helping end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere.\u201d",

        "title":"diet: The best and worst foods for acid reflux Mudge 17 August 22 with acid reflux? Find out how the GERD diet could help to ease symptoms",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/GERD-diet-the-best-and-worst-foods-for-acid-reflux",
        "text":"Acid reflux is a common issue among the American population, with an estimated 14-20% of adults suffering from a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Following a GERD diet may help to control this condition and generally help to reduce symptoms of acid reflux in those who experience it less frequently. The difference between GERD and occasional acid reflux is the frequency at which symptoms are experienced. GERD patients experience reflux more than twice a week, as well as symptoms including regurgitation of food or sour liquid, difficulty swallowing properly, loud breathing or wheezing, coughing, and heartburn. These symptoms are often particularly bad at night, which can interrupt sleep. We\u2019ve spoken to medical doctors to get their advice for managing GERD, the best GERD diets and which foods you should be eating and avoiding to keep your symptoms under control. It is also worth noting that GERD is sometimes called GORD. What foods can cause heartburn? Dr Deborah Lee, a medical doctor at Dr Fox Online Pharmacy (opens in new tab), explains that gastric reflux is caused by the stomach contents passing backwards from the stomach into the esophagus (throat). \u201cIn normal circumstances, food is kept inside the stomach due to a valve at the lower end of the esophagus called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES),\u201d she says. \u201cIf there is too much pressure on the LES, it becomes leaky and incompetent, and the partially digested food, mixed with stomach acids, is propelled upwards into the lower oesophagus. Certain foods and drinks can worsen gastric reflux. They may do this by stimulating excess gastric acid secretion or causing relaxation of the LES.\u201d Dr Deborah Lee, MD Medical Doctor Having worked for many years in the NHS, initially as a GP, and then as Lead Clinician for an integrated Community Sexual Health Service, Dr Deborah Lee now works as a health and medical writer, with an emphasis on women\u2019s health. She is a menopause specialist. A review in the Journal of Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (opens in new tab) indicates that dietary changes are considered the first-line treatment of GERD, with more attention being paid to medication overuse. Nonpharmacological therapies, such as dietary management, are currently considered the best way to manage GERD. \u201cEnzymes are specific substances found in your gut that are essential for breaking down food into tiny particles,\u201d adds Lee. \u201cThese can then be absorbed into the bloodstream.\u201d Enzymes that break down carbohydrates include amylase, maltase, lactase and sucrase. Lipase is responsible for breaking down fats and converting fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Proteases break down protein into separate amino acids. (Image credit: Getty Images) A 2019 review in the journal of Current Medicinal Chemistry (opens in new tab) indicates that high fat intake, coffee, chocolate, spicy foods and alcohol all increase reflux, although there is less data around fried food or carbonated beverages and their links to GERD. Dr Tariq Mahmood, MD, medical director of Concepto Diagnostics (opens in new tab), says: \u201cHeartburn is a burning sensation felt in the chest area when stomach acids travel back up the throat. When swallowing, a muscle at the bottom of the esophagus relaxes to allow food or drink into your stomach. However, if the muscle doesn\u2019t relax or weakens over time, stomach acid can flow back into the esophagus, which causes irritation and inflammation. \u201cThe causes of heartburn can differ from person to person, but common foods and drinks reported to make it worse are alcohol, chocolate, coffee, spicy foods and tomatoes. Additionally, foods high in fats and salts, such as fast food, fried food, pizza and processed snacks can trigger heartburn.\u201d Dr Tariq Mahmood, MD Medical Doctor Dr. Tariq Mahmood has nearly 30 years of experience in ultrasound, paediatrics, general medicine\/surgery, radiology, orthopaedics and obstetrics. He earned his bachelor's degree in Medical and Surgery from the Nishtar Medical College Multan in Pakistan in 1988 and spent seven years as a trainee radiologist after graduation before embarking on a career as a sonologist, sonographer, and ultrasound practitioner in the U.K. What foods can prevent acid reflux? The Current Medicinal Chemistry (opens in new tab) review vouches for the Mediterranean diet and the low carb diet as ways to manage GERD. The review also recommends leaving longer periods between eating and sleeping, with dinner at least four hours before bedtime to lower your risk of experiencing GERD symptoms overnight. Lee says that a high fiber diet can also help with GERD management. \u201cSufferers are likely to benefit from increasing the fiber content of their diet. Foods such as oatmeal, which is high in fiber, have been shown to reduce the concentration of gastric nitrites,\u201d she says. \u201cNitrates, often taken by those with heart disease, are known to worsen reflux symptoms. Fiber rich foods include those made from unrefined grains: brown bread, brown rice and brown pasta. It is also important to increase your fruit and vegetable intake. However, opt for non-citrus fruits such as bananas, melon, peaches, and pears, and root vegetables such as sweet potato, carrots, and beetroot. Full fat cow\u2019s milk has been shown to worsen reflux, so semi-skimmed or skimmed is preferable. Plant-based milk is a low-fat alternative. Drinking coconut water may also be helpful, says Lee. (Image credit: Getty Images) Dr Mahmood agrees that a high-fiber diet is best for GERD, and that alkaline fruits and vegetables can be helpful. \u201cThere are a range of foods that you can eat to prevent heartburn. Foods which are packed full of fiber make you feel full, meaning that you\u2019re less likely to binge eat unhealthy snacks or overeat. Green vegetables (asparagus, broccoli and green beans), root vegetables (beets, carrots and sweet potatoes) and whole grains (brown rice, couscous and oatmeal) are great high-fiber foods,\u201d he says. Dr Mahmood would also recommend alkaline foods and watery foods for someone who struggles with heartburn. Fruits and vegetables that are less acidic are less likely to cause reflux, including bananas, cauliflower and melons. Foods with a lot of water can dilute a strong stomach and weaken its acid \u2013 so you\u2019ll want to eat plenty of celery, cucumber and lettuce. Tips for managing GERD symptoms A review in the JAMA Surgery (opens in new tab) journal indicates that the best treatments for GERD include lifestyle changes, as well as the use of proton pump inhibitors and laparoscopic fundoplication (a keyhole procedure). Endoscopic treatments have been shown to be less effective. Mahmood says there are some over-the-counter treatments that can help with GERD symptoms, but that diet and lifestyle changes are the most effective tools. \u201cOne over-the-counter solution to heartburn is digestive enzyme supplements to aid digestion and help the body break down food,\u201d he says. \u201cA good digestion process is key, otherwise the body isn\u2019t able to take all of the key nutrients it needs from the food you eat and subsequently your body isn\u2019t properly energized.\u201d Other tips include: Not eating late at night (especially within three or four hours before going to bed) Optimizing your diet to avoid foods and drinks known to trigger acid reflux Wearing looser clothing so that pressure isn\u2019t applied to your stomach Raising your head when sleeping by up to eight inches (Image credit: Getty Images) Another risk factor for GERD is the presence of a hiatal hernia, where the entrance of the esophagus is abnormally shaped or misplaced in the thoracic cavity, according to a study in the Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (opens in new tab). A hiatal hernia can be diagnosed with an endoscopy and is often discovered when investigating the source of upper abdominal pain and chronic problems with acid reflux. If you know you have a hiatal hernia, it may be worth considering a GERD diet. \u201cIf you have troublesome reflux symptoms, see your doctor to be sure you have an accurate diagnosis,\u201d adds Lee. \u201cThis may mean you are referred for tests, likely to include an endoscopy and pH testing from the esophagus. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, there are a lot of things you can do to help yourself: Eat a healthy, balanced, low-fat diet with plenty of fiber \u2013 the Mediterranean Diet is a good option. is a good option. Lose weight \u2013 obesity puts extra pressure on the LES. Stop smoking \u2013 smoking is closely linked to acid reflux. Nicotine relaxes the LES, plus smokers have alterations in their saliva. Reduce your alcohol intake \u2013 alcohol intake is strongly linked to acid reflux. Get regular physical exercise \u2013 exercise can help reflux so long as it is the right type of exercise, and don\u2019t exercise within two hours of a meal. Exercise in which you are upright, for example, walking, jogging, or cycling are the best options. Avoid exercise that means bunching up your abdomen, such as gymnastics or weightlifting, or high-intensity exercise, such as sprinting or cycling fast.

        "title":"the first time, scientists have named a heat wave Pappas 15 August 22 the first time, authorities have given a heat wave a name. Scientists hope that naming extreme heat events will help the public protect itself.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/first-named-heat-wave",
        "text":"For the first time, scientists have named a heat wave. They called it Zoe. According to USA Today (opens in new tab), the Spanish scientists bestowed the moniker on a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44.4 degrees Celsius) in Seville between July 24 and July 27. It's a new effort to alert the public to extreme temperatures and warn them of the dangers, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Mart\u00edn Olalla, an associate professor in the department of condensed matter physics at Sevilla University, told the newspaper. Hurricanes have long received human names, and an unofficial practice of giving winter storms nicknames emerged in2012 in the United States. But Zoe is the first heat wave to be given a name. The name is an effort of the proMETEO Sevilla Project , an initiative of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center of the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research center and non-profit organization. Seville is the pilot location for the project, which aims to raise public awareness of extreme heat and to advocate for efforts to reduce the dangers of heat waves. Related: How heat waves kill so quickly Heat waves aren't just toasty days. They're defined by the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) as episodes of at least three consecutive days during which a minimum of 10% of weather stations record maximum temperatures above the 95th percentile for July to August between 1971 to 2000. There is no single definition of a heat wave in the United States, but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a benchmark of at least two days when the daily minimum temperature, adjusted for humidity, is greater than the 85th percentile for July and August between 1981 and 2010. Heat waves can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations like older individuals and people who do manual labor outdoors. The World Health Organization calculated in 2018 that between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to extreme heat each year increased by 125 million. In July, temperatures in England exceeded 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) for the first time on record. This level of heat can be deadly, particularly in regions that lack air conditioning or buildings constructed to cope with high temperatures. The United States is also experiencing periods of extreme heat as the climate changes . Today (Aug. 15), the nonprofit First Street Foundation released a report highlighting where extreme heat is likely to become more common in future decades. Their modeling suggests that the Deep South, southern Arizona and southern to central California will experience some of the most extreme shifts. For example, Miami-Dade County in Florida will likely experience 34 days above 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) by 2053, compared with seven today. Related: What are the effects of global warming? While 8 million people in the United States this year will experience a heat index above 125 degrees F (51.6 degrees C), a staggering 107 million are expected to experience those temperatures by 2053, the nonprofit found. (Heat index takes into account humidity to adjust how a given air temperature feels to the human body. The higher the humidity, the warmer a given air temperature will feel.) Zoe may be the first named heat wave, but it won't be the last. Authorities in Spain plan to alternate female and male names in reverse alphabetical order for future heat events. By naming heat waves, proMETEO Sevilla hopes to let the public know that they'll need to take extra care, USA Today reported. In a heat wave, the WHO advises keeping cool by opening windows at night to let cooler air in and keeping light out during the day. Special care should be taken to ensure that infants, people over the age of 60, or those with chronic health conditions be kept cool. Originally published on Live Science.",

        "text":"State-level reports are the best publicly available and timely data on child COVID-19 cases in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association are collaborating to collect and share all publicly available data from states on child COVID-19 cases. The definition of \u201cchild\u201d case is based on varying age ranges reported across states (see report Appendix for details and links to all data sources). For the week ending August 11th, almost 87,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a decline from the week prior of 96,600 cases. Reported COVID-19 cases among children have decreased substantially from the Omicron variant winter surge. Nearly 14.3 million children are reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports; almost 371,000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks. Approximately 6.4 million reported cases have been added in 2022. The age distribution of reported COVID-19 cases was provided on the health department websites of reporting states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Since the pandemic began, children represented 18.4% of total cumulated cases. Since early June, there has been a notable decline in the portion of reported weekly COVID-19 cases that are children. For the week ending August 11th, this portion was 14.4% (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). While COVID-19 cases are likely increasingly under-reported for all age groups, this decline indicates that children are disproportionately undercounted in reported COVID-19 cases. There is an urgent need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children\u2019s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth.",

        "text":"Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 According to Dr. Fedorowski, \u201csomewhere between 1% and 10% of individuals [who contracted SARS-CoV-2] will develop all these [cardiovascular] complications, [such as] myocarditis, pericarditis, and even blood clots building in [the] arteries.\u201d The difficulty in treating these cases, moreover, is [because] the cardiovascular impact can be difficult to pinpoint at first. \u201cWe are talking about very small blood clots in very small arteries \u2014 they are not so easy to detect,\u201d said Dr. Fedorowski. \u201cBut some patients may report having blue fingers out of nowhere, just being infected a few days before. And this might be a sign of a very small, tiny blood clot in [the] peripheral blood arteries.\u201d The Nature Medicine study that we referred to earlier in the article shows that there is an increased risk of a whole range of cardiovascular outcomes even in those not admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 \u2014 that is, even in milder cases of the disease. To reach this conclusion, the study authors analyzed data from a large cohort of \u201c153,760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5,637,647 (contemporary controls) and 5,859,411 (historical controls) individuals.\u201d This ongoing risk of cardiovascular issues does not apply only to adults. According to a paper in Circulation in November 2020, children can also experience acute heart failure weeks after having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is likely to be an effect of long COVID in children, which is also under investigation. However, the syndrome that has most puzzled scientists regarding its association with long COVID is POTS. What is POTS, really? The medical community generally describes POTS, the syndrome that affects more and more people with long COVID, as a dysautonomic phenomenon \u2014 that is, something that affects the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the body\u2019s \u201cautopilot mode,\u201d which controls key bodily functions, such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion. POTS is one of several forms of dysautonomia, alongside neurocardiogenic syncope, which involves frequent fainting spells and multiple system atrophy, a rare and fatal condition that leads to rapid systemic deterioration. The symptoms of POTS are as numerous as they are varied, ranging from lightheadedness upon standing up from a seated position to tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate), shortness of breath, and digestive symptoms. This heterogeneity of symptoms can make POTS difficult to diagnose. Doctors often mistake it for an anxiety disorder , as symptoms such as a rapid heart rate and heart palpitations also occur in people who experience anxiety. \u201cThe problem with POTS is that it seems to be not only a cardiovascular problem \u2014 [a] heart and vessel problem \u2014 [but also] a problem of your nervous system, sometimes on your gastrointestinal system,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski explained. \u201cAnd in the end, we call it \u2018dysautonomia,\u2019 as it seems [to be] about your autonomic nervous system, which controls all your autonomic functions [\u2026]. And as the autonomic nervous system controls, first of all, your circulatory system, the main symptoms that you feel are from the circulatory or from your heart palpitations or blood pressure instability \u2014 you don\u2019t feel good when you stand up, and so on. But the problems are a little bit diffused,\u201d he noted, pointing out that even top specialists may find it hard to diagnose POTS correctly. Ms. Meriquez V\u00e1zquez described her experience of POTS as a life altering syndrome, and she confirmed the similarity between symptoms of POTS and those of a panic attack: \u201c[M]y POTS started as very severe adrenaline rushes along with a racing heart, especially when I was standing \u2014 I would get so nauseated and dizzy. From all of the adrenaline, it felt like a panic attack, but it would come out of nowhere.\u201d Why does adrenaline, or epinephrine, play a role? Dr. Kavi explained that \u201cthe sympathetic nervous system is the fight-or-flight system, and that\u2019s where the adrenaline [\u2026] \u2014 noradrenaline \u2014 comes in.\u201d \u201cThe parasympathetic system is the rest-and-digest system. And for us to function normally, we have to have a balance between the two \u2014 a sort of equilibrium. And it\u2019s when that equilibrium gets disrupted, and one or [the other] is overpowering that people develop problems,\u201d she explained. What causes POTS? The mechanisms behind POTS remain unclear, but ongoing research is searching for the likeliest explanations. A study published in February 2022 in Cells found that people with POTS have platelet storage pool deficiency, a phenomenon linked to symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds, dysmenorrhea, easy bruising, and anemia. It also showed that people with POTS have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, all of which may suggest a state of chronic inflammation. \u201c[T]he data provided [in this study] suggest that POTS is a mixed inflammatory pattern disease,\u201d the authors conclude. POTS before and after COVID-19 Although more and more media content has started looking at POTS as a long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections, POTS itself is not a newly emerged syndrome. According to data that the nonprofit organization Dysautonomia International cited well before the pandemic, an estimated 1\u20133 million people in the U.S. had POTS. Although it is unclear how many more people are seeking care in the aftermath of COVID-19 than they were pre-pandemic, anecdotal reports seem to indicate a steep increase in cases, most of them associated with long COVID. Dr. Fedorowski also told us that he and his colleagues at the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden have been seeing an influx of people with long COVID whom doctors have referred for POTS treatment: \u201cWe experience a huge inflow of new referrals from different parts of the region of Stockholm, meaning that in the Stockholm area, [where] we have around 2.5 million citizens, [\u2026] from [that] whole area, we are getting referrals from primary care doctors [and] from other specialists from other hospitals regarding people who developed what we call \u2018long COVID\u2019 or \u2018post-COVID syndrome.\u2019 The main reason they are sent to us is that [here] is quite [a] high clinical suspicion of POTS \u2014 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.\u201d According to Dr. Fedorowski, at almost 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of referrals for POTS rehabilitation \u201chas doubled or tripled.\u201d Dr. Chung made a similar observation about the Johns Hopkins POTS Program, saying that he and his colleagues \u201chave [had] at least twice or three times more referrals\u201d at their clinic since the start of the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic numbers. And Dr. Kavi told us that the situation is the same in the U.K.: \u201cHere, the feedback that I\u2019m getting from the clinicians that we work with \u2014 who run POTS services and secondary care [\u2026] \u2014 [is] that they\u2019re noticing a significant increase in their referrals. And, of course, that means that their waiting lists are getting longer as well.\u201d Who is at risk of POTS, and why? Current data indicate that the people who most commonly receive a diagnosis of POTS in long COVID are young females. However, both Dr. Fedorowski and Dr. Chung noted that there is a slight difference in the demographics of people presenting with POTS before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have POTS associated with long COVID. According to the researchers, pre-pandemic, most people with POTS tended to be in their teens or early 20s, while people with long-COVID-associated POTS tend to be in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Dr. Fedorowski speculated that the high levels of stress that women in these demographics often encounter, perhaps due to persistent issues of gender inequality in the home and workplace, may play a role. \u201cA lot of younger women [\u2026] get affected by POTS as a consequence of COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski told Medical News Today. \u201cAnd if you talk to them [\u2026], then you will see a picture of a woman who is working very hard, having [a] family, taking care of children, and trying to reach some higher position in [\u2026] society; or [there] are the women who are very much stressed by feeling that they are not good enough.\u201d During the pandemic, for instance, women have continued to bear the higher burden of child care and stay-at-home orders during the early stages have also disproportionately affected working women. Research has shown that chronic stress can have a very real physiological impact, leading to impaired immune system function and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. However, reflecting on the shift in POTS demographics outlined by Drs Chung and Fedorowski, Dr. Kavi wondered whether \u201cit\u2019s a real increase in older people having POTS [after COVID-19] or whether it\u2019s just not being picked up in younger people\u201d since POTS is often not given due consideration as a possible diagnosis. \u201cIn terms of pediatricians and [family doctors], for example, they often don\u2019t think about [POTS as a possible diagnosis], and then there\u2019s very little, almost nothing in the way of services for people in the U.K. with POTS that are under the age of 16, so I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s there and we\u2019re missing it or it\u2019s not [been] there [previously].\u201d \u2013 Dr. Lesley Kavi Ms V\u00e0zquez also wondered whether more people with long COVID are now receiving POTS diagnoses not because they have newly developed the syndrome after becoming ill with COVID-19, but because their existing POTS symptoms have worsened in the aftermath. In their online support group, she told us, people are \u201coften reflecting on how they may have had signs of autonomic dysfunction prior to getting sick [with COVID-19].\u201d Research on POTS conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic further indicates that the syndrome can be associated with various chronic conditions, including diabetes, sarcoidosis, and lupus, as well as with aggressive treatments, such as chemotherapy. There is also some suggestion that POTS can develop following a viral illness and that sometimes genetic factors may be at play. According to PoTS UK, the syndrome can have associations with inherited conditions, such as hypermobility spectrum disorder and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. POTS also has associations with mast cell activation disorder , which causes allergic symptoms.",

        "title":"Here, we cover 12 persistent myths surrounding IBD. Among other topics, we will discuss treatment, stress, personality, and symptoms beyond the gut.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/medical-myths-all-about-ibd",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY. 1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d 2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD. 4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d 5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d 6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery. 7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d 8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d 9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD. 10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. 11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/covid-19-did-lockdown-help-or-hinder-our-creativity",
        "text":"New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle\/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. What were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity. The role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/covid-19-decision-fatigue-expert-tips-on-how-to-cope",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest What is decision fatigue, and how has this phenomenon evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Kayla Snell\/Stocksy. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision fatigue happens when, after making many decisions at once, a person\u2019s ability to make decisions declines. Complex decisions, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, deplete one\u2019s capacity for decision making especially quickly. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32% of adults in the United States struggled to make basic decisions, such as what to wear, due to COVID-19-induced stress. Different age groups reported experiencing the phenomenon at different rates: 48% of millennials 37% of Generation Z 32% of Generation X 14% of baby boomers 3% of older adults These findings correspond with the survey\u2019s findings on stress levels. Younger groups were significantly more likely to report high stress levels than older groups. Parents with children under 18 years old were also disproportionately affected by stress compared with those without children. While 47% of these parents reported that day-to-day decisions were more stressful than before the pandemic, the same was true for 30% of those without children under 18 years old. People of Color have also been more affected by pandemic-related stress. According to the study, 38% of Hispanic adults and 36% of Black adults reported that pandemic-related stress impacted their decision making, compared with 29% of non-Hispanic White adults. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub. How the concept came to be Decision fatigue happens when a person becomes fatigued or exhausted from making too many decisions. It affects a person\u2019s ability to make further decisions, whether simple, such as deciding what to eat for dinner, or complex, such as determining whether or not to change jobs. The concept of decision fatigue originated in 1998. It centers on the idea that humans have a limited capacity to regulate their behavior. This means that after a certain point, people simply run out of energy to make decisions, much like a car running out of fuel once its petrol tank is empty. Running out of \u201cdecision making fuel\u201d is also known as ego depletion. Ego depletion changes the way we focus on and process information to make decisions, as well as our motivations. These motivational shifts can make a person more likely to make impulsive decisions that, under normal circumstances, they would not make. \u201cDoing repeated decision making [that] involves trade-offs between multiple competing values, such as risks and benefits\u201d increases a person\u2019s risk of experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g, an associate professor at Linkoping University in Sweden, told Medical News Today. \u201cCareful consideration of pros and cons in decision making is mentally taxing and may lead to decision fatigue when we feel stressed and mentally overloaded. This can lead people to shy away from engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning when tired and instead turn to decision\u2010making heuristics, that is, mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions on the basis of simple rules of thumb without engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g But decision fatigue does not just happen from making decisions. It can happen from any activity that demands the exertion of self-control. Dr. Grant A. Pignatiello, an instructor and clinical research scholar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told MNT that \u201c[d]ecision fatigue can manifest after repeated or effortful attempts of self-control.\u201d \u201cThe most common example is from making decisions. But it can also result from controlling your emotions, doing things that require cognitive effort, or intense physical exertion,\u201d he noted. Susceptibility Several factors are associated with a higher risk of decision fatigue, including: chronic exposure to stress and work complexity to stress and work complexity low knowledge and experience of independent decision making and a lack of direct managerial supervision and a lack of direct managerial supervision a high workload a lack of time to make decisions Dr. Pignatiello said that everyone is susceptible to decision fatigue. However, the exact causes will differ from person to person: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the circumstances that lead to decision fatigue are unique for every person \u2014 for example, two individuals doing the same thing may experience different levels of decision fatigue. For a literal example, running a 5K may deplete your tank more than it would a person who runs every day.\u201d He added that the demands of modern everyday life, alongside modern work environments, necessitate complicated decisions that may make some more susceptible to decision fatigue than others. How to spot decision fatigue Signs of decision fatigue include brain fog, feeling tired, and other signs of physical or mental fatigue. These may intensify the more decisions a person makes throughout the day. When asked how people may be able to spot whether or not they are experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Tingh\u00f6g said, \u201cIf there are drifts in the type of decision you are making throughout the day, without there being a logical explanation, this could be due to decision fatigue.\u201d \u201cBut also, it is possible to identify decision fatigue through introspection,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we feel that we don\u2019t have enough mental energy to make a thorough deliberation before an important decision, we are suffering from decision fatigue.\u201d Dr. Pignatiello also noted: \u201cIt requires some self-awareness for us to know when we may be in a state of decision fatigue. Some common signs include struggling with decisions that otherwise would not require much thought, e.g., \u2018What do I eat for dinner?\u2019 \u2018What should I wear?\u2019, feeling overwhelmed by our emotions, having a harder time remembering things or focusing, or simply just feeling more \u2018drained\u2019 than normal.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/new-langya-virus-found-in-china-what-to-know-about-symptoms-transmission",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest The newly discovered Langya virus appears to be transmitted through shrew animals, according to early research. Porpen Praditpattanachan\/EyeEm\/Getty Images Researchers discovered a new virus in eastern China spread through shrew animals. So far, 35 people have tested positive for the \u201cLangya\u201d virus and exhibited symptoms such as running a fever, coughing, and headache. The Langya virus has not caused fatalities in any of the patients who contracted the virus. Researchers are unsure whether human-to-human transmission is possible with the Langya virus and plan to continue monitoring the situation. Less than three years after the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, researchers found another virus that spreads from animals to humans. The findings appear in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Langya virus was detected in nearly three dozen people in the provinces of Shandong and Henan in the eastern parts of the country. Langya: A zoonotic virus Zoonotic diseases occur when animals spread germs to humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), zoonotic diseases \u201care caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.\u201d Some of the more well-known types of zoonotic viruses include the West Nile virus and rabies. Additionally, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is zoonotic. Scientists found that animal-to-human transmissions took place after SARS-CoV-2 emerged. Since late 2019, the virus has claimed more than 6 million lives. The new zoonotic virus researchers discovered in China is the Langya virus, which belongs to the henipavirus genus. Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert, based in San Francisco, spoke with Medical News Today and offered some insight into henipaviruses. \u201cA family of viruses [has] been classified in the genus called henipavirus, and these are RNA viruses which occasionally cause illness in humans and cross over into humans from animals such as bats or pigs,\u201d Dr. Gandhi explained. Dr. Gandhi is a professor of Medicine and Associate Division Chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Before discovering the Langya virus, researchers had identified five forms of henipaviruses. Of the five, CDC describes Hendra virus and Nipah virus as being \u201chighly virulent emerging pathogens that cause outbreaks in humans and are associated with high case-fatality ratio.\u201d Langya virus discovery As part of a program to monitor people who exhibited fevers after contact with animals, officials detected the first person with the Langya virus toward the end of 2018. Using a throat swab sample, researchers discovered the new virus \u201cby means of metagenomic analysis and subsequent virus isolation.\u201d After identifying the Langya virus, researchers monitored samples from patients with fevers following animal exposure for the next 2 years. During that time, they detected the Langya virus in an additional 34 individuals. To determine which animal species was the source of the virus, scientists tested multiple animals for the presence of the Langya virus. They found evidence of the virus in goats and dogs, but the animal that was the primary source of the Langya virus was the shrew. After finding the virus present in 27% of shrew samples, the authors write that the discovery \u201csuggests that the shrew may be a natural reservoir of [the Langya virus].\u201d Shrews, which look similar to mice but are an entirely different species, are small mammals found worldwide. Shrews have spread diseases in the past, including mammarenavirus and hantavirus. Symptoms of Langya virus Some of the symptoms of the Langya virus include the following: fever fatigue cough myalgia headache vomiting Of the symptoms patients with the Langya virus experienced, fever was the most prevalent, with 100% of the patients presenting with fever. Roughly half of the patients experienced fatigue, cough, and loss of appetite. Also, approximately one-third of patients with the Langya virus had impaired liver functioning, and 8% of the patients experienced impaired kidney functioning. Do people spread Langya? The researchers have not found evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus at this point. They found that none of the patients who contracted Langya virus caught it from each other. Additionally, none of them spread it to others in their households. This finding does not necessarily mean human-to-human transmissions are not happening. The researchers pointed out that their sample size was too small to be certain at this point. \u201cContact tracing of 9 patients with 15 close contact family members revealed no close-contact LayV transmission, but our sample size was too small to determine the status of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the authors wrote. Researchers plan to continue monitoring for the Langya virus, and Taiwan\u2019s Centers for Disease Control reportedly plans to develop testing for the Langya virus.",

        "text":"Share on Pinterest After 2 years of COVID-19, what does mental health look like, worldwide? Image credit: Boy_Anupong\/Getty Images. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub. Fear and isolation The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress. Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d Worldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d Who is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d On the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d Taking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d",

Leon Neal \u2013 WPA Pool\/Getty Images The United Kingdom has become the first country to approve Moderna\u2019s bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine was developed to target both the original strain and Omicron BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Joint committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JVCI) will decide how the new vaccine will be offered and if it will be included in its wider fall immunization program against COVID-19 and the flu. This is a developing story. The article will be updated as more information becomes available. The U.K.\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced on Monday, August 15 that it had officially approved Moderna\u2019s new updated COVID-19 vaccine targeting two different coronavirus variants. In a press release, the MHRA said the vaccine would be used as a booster dose in adults after the vaccine passed tests of safety, quality, and effectiveness. The booster dose is bivalent, meaning that it can fight two different variants of the virus. It is called \u201cSpikevax bivalent Original\/Omicron\u201d and contains 50 micrograms of mRNA, half of which targets the original variant from 2020, and the other half targets Omicron BA.1. \u201cThe first generation of COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.K. continue to provide important protection against the disease and save lives. What this bivalent vaccine gives us is a sharpened tool in our armory to help protect us against this disease as the virus continues to evolve,\u201d said Dr. June Raine, MHRA chief executive. The vaccine will be available in England, Scotland, and Wales, while Northern Ireland has received an emergency use authorization. The U.K. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will now decide whether the updated vaccine will be used in the country\u2019s fall COVID-19 booster program, which it aims to complete by December 2022.",

        "text":"Today, CDC is streamlining its COVID-19 guidance to help people better understand their risk, how to protect themselves and others, what actions to take if exposed to COVID-19, and what actions to take if they are sick or test positive for the virus. COVID-19 continues to circulate globally, however, with so many tools available to us for reducing COVID-19 severity, there is significantly less risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death compared to earlier in the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re in a stronger place today as a nation, with more tools\u2014like vaccination, boosters, and treatments\u2014to protect ourselves, and our communities, from severe illness from COVID-19,\u201d said Greta Massetti, PhD, MPH, MMWR author. \u201cWe also have a better understanding of how to protect people from being exposed to the virus, like wearing high-quality masks, testing, and improved ventilation. This guidance acknowledges that the pandemic is not over, but also helps us move to a point where COVID-19 no longer severely disrupts our daily lives.\u201d In support of this update CDC is: Continuing to promote the importance of being up to date with vaccination to protect people against serious illness, hospitalization, and death. Protection provided by the current vaccine against symptomatic infection and transmission is less than that against severe disease and diminishes over time, especially against the currently circulating variants. For this reason, it is important to stay up to date, especially as new vaccines become available. Updating its guidance for people who are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines on what to do if exposed to someone with COVID-19. This is consistent with the existing guidance for people who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccines. Recommending that instead of quarantining if you were exposed to COVID-19, you wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested on day 5. Reiterating that regardless of vaccination status, you should isolate from others when you have COVID-19. You should also isolate if you are sick and suspect that you have COVID-19 but do not yet have test results. If your results are positive, follow CDC\u2019s full isolation recommendations. If your results are negative, you can end your isolation. Recommending that if you test positive for COVID-19, you stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home. You are likely most infectious during these first 5 days. Wear a high-quality mask when you must be around others at home and in public. If after 5 days you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of medication, and your symptoms are improving, or you never had symptoms, you may end isolation after day 5. Regardless of when you end isolation, avoid being around people who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 until at least day 11. You should wear a high-quality mask through day 10. Recommending that if you had moderate illness (if you experienced shortness of breath or had difficulty breathing) or severe illness (you were hospitalized) due to COVID-19 or you have a weakened immune system, you need to isolate through day 10. (if you experienced shortness of breath or had difficulty breathing) or severe illness (you were hospitalized) due to COVID-19 or you have a weakened immune system, you need to isolate through day 10. Recommending that if you had severe illness or have a weakened immune system, consult your doctor before ending isolation. Ending isolation without a viral test may not be an option for you. If you are unsure if your symptoms are moderate or severe or if you have a weakened immune system, talk to a healthcare provider for further guidance. or have a weakened immune system, consult your doctor before ending isolation. Ending isolation without a viral test may not be an option for you. If you are unsure if your symptoms are moderate or severe or if you have a weakened immune system, talk to a healthcare provider for further guidance. Clarifying that after you have ended isolation, if your COVID-19 symptoms worsen, restart your isolation at day 0. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have questions about your symptoms or when to end isolation. Recommending screening testing of asymptomatic people without known exposures will no longer be recommended in most community settings. Emphasizing that physical distance is just one component of how to protect yourself and others. It is important to consider the risk in a particular setting, including local COVID-19 Community Levels and the important role of ventilation, when assessing the need to maintain physical distance. Actions to take will continue to be informed by the COVID-19 Community Levels, launched in February. CDC will continue to focus efforts on preventing severe illness and post-COVID conditions, while ensuring everyone have the information and tools, they need to lower their risk. This updated guidance is intended to apply to community settings. In the coming weeks CDC will work to align stand-alone guidance documents, such as those for healthcare settings, congregate settings at higher risk of transmission, and travel, with today\u2019s update.",

        "text":"Each day of the summer of 2020 and 2021, Smithsonian research zoologist Gary Graves went out to his backyard in the Ozark Mountains to face a familiar crime scene: the vibrant orange blooms of his trumpet creeper vine littering the ground, the flowers full of holes and torn to shreds. The perpetrator: a little flock of chestnut and yellow orchard orioles. Graves, a curator in the museum's division of birds who specializes in birds like vultures and the microscopic organisms that live inside them, documented the magnitude of daily vandalism like a forensic analysis. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History shut down and few museum personnel were allowed entry. At the time, Graves was in the middle of a project studying the microbiomes of vultures, but the pandemic put that project on hold. Unable to conduct his regular research at the museum, Graves journeyed to his vacation home in the Ozarks to telework, about a thousand miles west of DC. During the summer months, he noticed a persistent pattern of birds stealing nectar from his backyard flowers. He quickly recognized this behavior as unusual and unstudied and decided his next research project would be to characterize this behavior happening right in his own backyard. \u201cI was prohibited by the museum from doing any research travel and couldn\u2019t get permission to do field research, so I was stuck in my yard,\u201d said Graves. \u201cBut then I thought, \u2018here is something that I can do.\u2019\u201d What makes nectar-robbery particularly unusual? After all, nectar\u2019s entire purpose is to be consumed by animals. However, not all nectar sips are created equal. Graves describes three different types of nectar consumption: legitimate pollination, nectar thievery, and nectar-robbery. The first follows the common story of pollination \u2013 an animal coevolves with a flowering plant in a way that results in a mutually beneficial scenario. The animal, such as a bee or hummingbird, pollinates the flower and receives nutritious nectar from the plant as a reward. \u201cAnd that's a nice clean story,\u201d Graves said. \u201cBut in every system, there are always free-riders and cheaters.\u201d Those free-riders and cheaters are the nectar thieves and robbers. Nectar thieves are those who take the nectar without pollinating the flower but cause no harm otherwise. Flower anatomy typically fits their coevolved pollinator like lock and key, helping the pollinators live up to their namesake while enjoying their sweet nectar treat. Nectar thieves bypass this pollination system, taking the reward without fulfilling their end of the bargain. \u201cSo a nectar thief is like a shoplifter, but a nectar-robber is someone who takes a sledgehammer to a jewelry store.\u201d This ruinous behavior can possibly shut down the reproductive potential of the plant. The robbers either rip the flowers off entirely or provide an easy shortcut to the nectar reward, like a borehole through the flower petals, to entice the legitimate pollinators away from doing their job. Since the plant can\u2019t fight back, the only defense it has is to evolve in some manner to minimize or circumvent the effects of the oriole\u2019s nectar-robbery. According to Graves, avian nectar-robbery is not as well-known in North America as on other continents. The trumpet creeper observations have some neat implications in the broader field of pollination biology. So Graves took the opportunity to document it himself while in lockdown. Every morning, Graves went out to assess the damage: how many flowers did these birds ruin? What method of destruction were they using? Did their methods change? He noted everything on a spreadsheet and did this for more than 40 days in both 2020 and 2021. Now, his paper describing the method of the mayhem appears in the journal Scientific Reports The main finding Graves described was that the orioles wrought havoc on the plant\u2019s reproduction during their presence. The birds bored holes and robbed nectar from over 90 percent of the plant\u2019s flowers, and the plant bore no fruit until the orioles departed the region on their fall migration. Extending the flowering season past the birds\u2019 departure date may be the only way for this population of trumpet creepers to reproduce. Results aside, Graves feels that the paper\u2019s main take-home message is that the opportunity for scientific discovery is everywhere. There is no need to travel great distances or have fancy equipment to make noteworthy scientific discoveries \u2013 the next discovery could be hiding in plain sight in your backyard. But like all good detectives, scientists must have an inquisitive eye.

        "text":"Excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries when using standard methods because of gaps in the underlying data. Therefore, statistical methods are required to derive the expected and total deaths based on the levels of data available for countries; this is why these figures are called 'estimates'. The methodology for generating the estimates adopts a statistical method called a Poisson regression model and has been developed in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and an appointed Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Mortality Assessment. Our estimates have a range of uncertainty per country and that level of uncertainty is directly related to a country's reporting capacity and variable data quality. As we chart the range between the upper and lower bounds of uncertainty for WHO regions, we are able to observe the relative availability of data for each region and how data gaps disproportionately impact some parts of the world more than others. If the uncertainty bounds are larger, this indicates that there is less available data and therefore, a corresponding greater degree of uncertainty. These ranges in uncertainty serve to highlight the ongoing need and work of WHO, as we partner with countries to strengthen national Health Information Systems, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems and reporting of causes of death, and integrated surveillance systems to help improve data availability and close 'data gaps'.",

This is the first time that many monkeypox cases and clusters have been reported concurrently in non-endemic and endemic countries in widely disparate geographical areas.

We are issuing guidance to help countries on surveillance, laboratory work, clinical care, infection prevention and control, as well as risk communication and community engagement to inform communities at risk and the broader general public about monkeypox and how to keep safe.

        "text":"A group of global experts convened by WHO has agreed on new names for monkeypox virus variants, as part of ongoing efforts to align the names of the monkeypox disease, virus and variants \u2013 or clades \u2013 with current best practices. The experts agreed to name the clades using Roman numerals. The monkeypox virus was named upon first discovery in 1958, before current best practices in naming diseases and viruses were adopted. Similarly for the name of the disease it causes. Major variants were identified by the geographic regions where they were known to circulate. Current best practice is that newly-identified viruses, related disease, and virus variants should be given names with the aim to avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups, and minimize any negative impact on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare. Disease: Assigning new names to existing diseases is the responsibility of WHO under the International Classification of Diseases and the WHO Family of International Health Related Classifications (WHO-FIC). WHO is holding an open consultation for a new disease name for monkeypox. Anyone wishing to propose new names can do so here (see ICD-11, Add proposals). Virus: The naming of virus species is the responsibility of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which has a process underway for the name of the monkeypox virus. Variants\/clades: The naming of variants for existing pathogens is normally the result of debate amongst scientists. In order to expedite agreement in the context of the current outbreak, WHO convened an ad hoc meeting on 8 August to enable virologists and public health experts to reach consensus on new terminology. Experts in pox virology, evolutionary biology and representatives of research institutes from across the globe reviewed the phylogeny and nomenclature of known and new monkeypox virus variants or clades. They discussed the characteristics and evolution of monkeypox virus variants, their apparent phylogenetic and clinical differences, and potential consequences for public health and future virological and evolutionary research. The group reached consensus on new nomenclature for the virus clades that is in line with best practices. They agreed on how the virus clades should be recorded and classified on genome sequence repository sites. Consensus was reached to now refer to the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade as Clade one (I) and the former West African clade as Clade two (II). Additionally, it was agreed that the Clade II consists of two subclades. The proper naming structure will be represented by a Roman numeral for the clade and a lower-case alphanumeric character for the subclades. Thus, the new naming convention comprises Clade I, Clade IIa and Clade IIb, with the latter referring primarily to the group of variants largely circulating in the 2022 global outbreak. The naming of lineages will be as proposed by scientists as the outbreak evolves. Experts will be reconvened as needed. The new names for the clades should go into effect immediately while work continues on the disease and virus names.",

        "text":"Monkeypox has health officials repeating their COVID-19 mistakes This article features Government Accountability Project\u2019s whistleblower client, Dr. Don Weiss, and was originally published here. It\u2019s a virus with a different name, different symptoms, and different forms of transmission. Yet as monkeypox spreads, we find ourselves mired in the same mess of mixed signals, contradictory advice, and unclear \u2014 sometimes even incorrect \u2014 messaging we saw early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Why can\u2019t medical authorities speak honestly and directly about new viruses that impact us \u2014 and how we can best protect ourselves? With COVID, some early stumbles could be explained by the virus being previously unknown. But monkeypox, though new to many, is very familiar to scientists and physicians. It\u2019s hard to understand why they couldn\u2019t get this right from the beginning. Why couldn\u2019t they clearly explain who was more likely to be infected, under what circumstances, and what anyone should do differently? Instead, we face another public health emergency with rising case numbers \u2014 above 2,500 in New York State and more than 50 on Long Island \u2014 a limited vaccine supply, and a lack of clear direction and advice. Now, the effort to get more vaccine doses out of a vial adds another layer of uncertainty. Making matters worse is the stigma looming over the monkeypox conversation, a stigma all too familiar from the not-so-distant memory of the AIDS crisis. Monkeypox is spread by close, physical contact. While often spread through sex, it can also pass from person to person through other forms of prolonged touch and skin-to-skin contact, or even via bedding and clothing. And while it has primarily impacted the gay, bisexual and transgender community, and the vast majority of transmission has occurred among men who\u2019ve had sexual contact with other men, particularly with multiple partners, it\u2019s not limited to that, either. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to talk about \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be hard to balance definitive messaging and clear advice to those at risk with the nuance this virus requires. But public health officials so far have failed on all fronts. In New York City, Dr. Don Weiss, the former surveillance director for the city health department\u2019s communicable disease department, was reassigned controversially by the department last month after Weiss publicly criticized the city\u2019s monkeypox messaging. He had emphasized the importance of telling men who have sex with other men to temporarily limit their number of partners to reduce transmission, a strategy other city officials avoided perhaps because of the fear of stigmatization. The city\u2019s approach may have led to increased spread; shutting down important voices like Weiss\u2019 doesn\u2019t help those at risk. Other experts, however, have at times eschewed nuance altogether. Earlier this month, Suffolk County Health Commissioner Gregson Pigott spoke at a community forum with the LGBT Network, and addressed men who are in a \u201cstable\u201d relationship with another man. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk,\u201d Pigott incorrectly said. \u201cYou\u2019re not someone who has to worry about contracting monkeypox.\u201d It\u2019s not that simple. The risk extends to social settings, gatherings with friends, or sharing a vacation home or other space where physical contact can occur, so individuals can remain at risk even if they\u2019re in a committed relationship. At least in Suffolk and NYC, officials are talking about monkeypox. In Nassau, little has been said \u2014 and vaccines remain elusive, though officials say they\u2019re waiting for more from the state. Public health experts are working to get monkeypox under control. But without a clear, accurate message, and vaccinations for all who need them, we\u2019re left with another spreading virus \u2014 with little end in sight.",

        "title":"Monkeypox: New clinical symptoms are identified in confirmed cases",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/378\/bmj.o1845",
        "text":"Jacqui Wise Kent The largest study of confirmed monkeypox cases to date has identified new clinical symptoms that are similar to those of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections and could easily lead to misdiagnosis.1 These symptoms included single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anal mucosa. An international collaboration across 16 countries reported 528 infections that were diagnosed between 27 April and 24 June 2022. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95% of these patients presented with a rash, 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions. A 10th of the patients (54) had only a single genital lesion. Another unexpected finding was that 15% had anal or rectal pain (or both). The study authors said that the current case definitions for monkeypox should be expanded to help diagnosis and slow the spread of infection. Existing definitions do recommend consideration of monkeypox in the context of any \u201cunusual\u201d rash but do not cover the full range of possible manifestations. \u201cThe current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa, and single ulcers,\u201d said Chloe Orkin, professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London and director of the Sexual Health and HIV All East Research (SHARE) collaborative, which is based in east London and investigates the inequalities that lead to poor sexual health and HIV. Orkin added, \u201cThese particular symptoms can be severe and have led to hospital admissions, so it is important to make a diagnosis. Expanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognise the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.\u201d In the case series, 98% of the people infected were gay or bisexual men, 75% were white, and 41% had HIV. Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), headache (27%), and lymphadenopathy (56%). Among the 23 patients with a clear exposure history the median incubation period was seven days (range 3-20). Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the cases. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 people in whom seminal fluid was analysed. However, this may be incidental, as it is not yet known whether it is present at high enough levels to facilitate sexual transmission. \u201cIt is important to stress that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense; it can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact,\u201d said study author John Thornhill, a consultant physician in sexual health and HIV and clinical senior lecturer at Barts NHS Health Trust and Queen Mary University of London. \u201cHowever, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity\u2014mainly, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men.\u201d Most of the cases reported in the series were mild and self-limited, and there were no deaths. The study also found that HIV infection was not linked to monkeypox severity. Although 13% of the patients were admitted to a hospital, no serious complications were reported in the majority of those admitted. Common reasons for admission were pain and bacterial superinfection. However, the study authors pointed out that rare serious complications, including myocarditis and epiglottitis, were observed and that therefore longer term follow-up of cases was needed. Commenting on the study, Claire Dewsnapp, president of the British Association for Sexual Health, said the UK government must be bold in acting against monkeypox. \u201cThese measures must include an effective vaccine procurement and delivery plan, a clearly accountable national response lead, and a national plan for testing, assessment, treatment, and prevention,\u201d she said. As of 18 July 2022 there were 2137 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, 2050 of them in England. Almost three quarters (73%) of England\u2019s cases were in London.2 In response to the rising number of cases the UK Health Security Agency said that it had procured an additional 100 000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. Gay and bisexual men at high risk of exposure to monkeypox will be offered the vaccine.34 On 19 July the UK Health Security Agency also updated its guidance for close contacts of a confirmed monkeypox case.5 This said that close contacts won\u2019t need to isolate at home if they don\u2019t have symptoms, as the latest data showed that a relatively small number of close contacts had gone on to develop monkeypox and there was a lack of evidence of transmission outside close intimate or sexual contact.",

        "text":"Conclusions These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission. Results The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6%). 170 (86.3%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102\/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70\/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling. Setting A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022. The observed clinical features of monkeypox infection in the 2022 UK outbreak differ from those in historical reports. We describe the characteristics and clinical features of monkeypox infection in people managed through a single south London centre and present a series of novel presentations. has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset A person with an unexplained rash on any part of their body plus one or more classical symptom or symptoms of monkeypox infection*\u2020 since 15 March 2022 and either: A person with an illness where the clinician has a high suspicion of monkeypox (for example, this may include prodrome or atypical presentations with exposure histories deemed high risk by the clinician, or classical rash without risk factors). A person with a febrile prodrome* compatible with monkeypox infection where there is known prior contact with a confirmed case in the 21 days before symptom onset. Monkeypox is designated as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK. 18 In the 2022 outbreak, the rapid community spread meant that most infected individuals were managed at home after risk assessment. 19 The box shows the current UK Health Security Agency case definition of possible and probable monkeypox infection. 20 The incubation period of monkeypox is currently understood to be about 12 days (range 5-24 days). 11 12 Classic descriptions of monkeypox infection depict biphasic clinical features, with a prodromal phase characterised by fever, malaise, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and headache, followed by skin eruption 2-4 days later. 11 Skin lesions follow a typical pattern of evolution, starting as macules and progressing into papules, vesicles, and pustules, which subsequently crust over and then desquamate. 13 15 Historically, lesions have appeared simultaneously and progressed sequentially. 16 Lesions have predominantly affected the face (95% of infected people), palms and soles (75%), mucous membranes (70%), and, less commonly, genitals. 5 Most infections are self-limiting and relatively mild, with symptoms lasting 2-4 weeks. Severe manifestations of infection include encephalitis, secondary skin infection, pneumonia, and ocular disease leading to loss of vision. Higher risk populations include neonates, children, and those with immunodeficiency. 17 Monkeypox is due to an orthopoxvirus, which rarely causes disease in humans. Although the exact reservoir of the virus is still unknown, rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus was first identified in 1958, among primates in captivity for research purposes. 4 Two genetically distinct viral clades are described: Central African (Congo Basin) and West African. 5 The first reports of humans becoming infected were recorded in 1970, when a smallpox-like illness was investigated in areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo thought to be free of variola. 6 7 Monkeypox is endemic in the Congo Basin and West Africa, where outbreaks involving 23 to 88 people have been described. 8 9 Several animal species are susceptible to the infection, and animal to human transmission through handling and ingesting wild game animals has been identified as the primary route of infection in African outbreaks, followed by human to human transmission through close contact with infected individuals. 10 Spread of respiratory droplets and direct contact with skin lesions and scabs have been described as the predominant routes of transmission between humans, but transmission can also occur via fomites. 11 In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak in the Western hemisphere was reported in 11 people in the United States who had been in close contact with infected prairie dogs. These animals had been transported alongside a Giant Gambian rat, presumed to be the primary source of the infection. 12 Since 2018, travel associated monkeypox infection has been diagnosed in four people in the UK, with onward transmission to three further people. 13 Sporadic cases of imported infections have also been reported in the US, Singapore, and Israel. 14 On 6 May 2022, the UK High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) network was alerted to an individual with monkeypox who had recently returned from West Africa. Six further infected individuals were identified the following week, without epidemiological linkage to West Africa. As of 12 July, 1735 people had been identified with monkeypox in the UK, most (96%) occurring in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and 79% occurring in London. 1 2 People with monkeypox infection have also been reported in several other non-endemic countries in Europe and the Americas, with the highest reported case loads outside of the UK in Spain and Germany. 3 The research question for this study was formed through discussions with patients. Although there was no further direct patient or public involvement in this paper owing to limited resources, we have asked members of the public to read our manuscript after submission and also plan to disseminate key messages through social media and conferences. We calculated means and medians for continuous data, and percentages for nominal data. The Clopper-Pearson exact method was used to calculate confidence intervals for symptom prevalence. Kaplan Meier for length of stay analysis was calculated using Graphpad Prism version 9.3.1. All other analysis was calculated using Microsoft Excel version 16.62. Clinical data were collected through one of three electronic healthcare systems: Electronic Patient Record iSOFT Clinical Manager 1.6 (iSOFT Group, Falls Church, VA), eNoting Client (an in-house patient records system), and preView (IMS MAXIMS, Milton Keynes, UK). Data were collected on personal characteristics, signs and symptoms reported at presentation, mucocutaneous manifestations (description, number, characteristics, and locations), risk factors as defined by the UK Health Security Agency (travel, contacts, and sexual history), HIV status, and sexual health screen results. Typical lesions were defined as macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, umbilication, crust, or scab. All people tested for monkeypox virus between 13 May and 1 July 2022 were identified through routine tracking of samples sent from the centre\u2019s virology laboratory to the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. Those who tested positive were included for further study. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of people with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed monkeypox virus, who were tested and managed through a south London HCID centre. The centre is one of five HCID centres in the UK and serves an inner city central and south London population. Swabs for diagnostic sampling were taken from the lesions at affiliated community sexual health and HIV medicine services, on admission to hospital (inpatient ward or emergency department) or on transfer of patients with suspected monkeypox from neighbouring NHS trusts (see supplementary figure 1). Samples were processed at the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Porton Down, UK. 21 People with suspected and confirmed monkeypox infection were risk stratified according to disease severity, immune status, and their ability to self-isolate, and managed accordingly. As part of routine clinical care, individuals were clinically assessed before testing. All people with a positive PCR test result for monkeypox virus took part in a telephone consultation to be counselled about their result and to conduct a risk assessment. Of the 98\/295 people who tested negative for monkeypox virus by PCR, the most common clinical presentations were rash (n=46, 47.0%), oral or genital ulcers (n=16, 16.3%), and pustules (n=24, 24.5%). Other presentations included rectal symptoms (n=8, 8.2%), sore throat (n=2, 2.0%), fever (n=1, 1.0%), and hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1, 1.0%). Median length of stay for discharged participants was 8 days (interquartile range 3.5 to 10 days) (see supplementary figure 3). One participant remains in hospital, and one additional patient was transferred to a different hospital for capacity reasons. No participants required organ support or died. One participant required patient controlled analgesia with fentanyl for severe rectal pain. Five participants had substantial proctitis confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one participant with rectal pain developed a rectal perforation that was managed conservatively, and one patient developed necrotising secondary bacterial infection. Participants with rectal pain were treated with oral and topical analgesia (paracetamol, ibuprofen, opioids, and lidocaine gel); rectal suppositories containing emollient, mesalazine, or steroid; and oral laxatives. To date no adverse events associated with these treatments have been observed. The most common clinical reasons for admission were perianal or rectal pain (8\/20 participants) and penile swelling (5\/20). Three participants had perianal or groin abscesses. Two participants had tonsillar abscesses. Two participants required ophthalmology review owing to eye involvement. Urinary retention, superimposed bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, and disseminated lesions in the context of immunocompromise occurred in one patient each. Of 20 participants admitted to hospital for clinical reasons, 15 (75.0%) had HIV co-infection. Three (15.0%) of the admitted participants were considered to have immunosuppression due to either HIV or immunosuppressive treatment. Twenty five (12.7%) participants were admitted to hospital, of whom 20 (10.2% of the total cohort) were admitted for clinical reasons. The remainder were admitted for containment as they were unable to effectively self-isolate at home. Of those tested for concomitant sexually transmitted infections, 34 (21.1%) tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 18 (11.2%) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 11 (7.0%) for herpes simplex virus 1 or 2, and 6 (3.7%) for Treponema pallidum ( table 4 ). Overall, 56\/178 (31.5%) participants had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection, and 12 of these cases had more than one simultaneous sexually transmitted infection. Nineteen participants were not screened for any sexually transmitted infection at initial review. Seventy of the 197 (35.5%) participants had HIV-1 co-infection (n=2 unknown). Sixty four (91.4%) of these participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (n=4 unknown) ( table 3 ). Fifty five (78.6%) had an undetectable HIV-1 viral load (<200 copies\/mL) (n=13 unknown). The median CD4 count was 664 cells\/\u03bcL (interquartile range 522-894 cells\/\u03bcL) (n=40 unknown). Fifty four (27.4%) participants had a history of travel abroad within four weeks before symptom onset. Most common destinations were within western Europe: Spain (20), France (8), Belgium (4), Germany (4), and Greece (4). One participant had returned from an endemic area (West Africa). Forty one of 155 (26.5%) participants reported known close contact with someone who showed symptoms of or had confirmed monkeypox infection (n=42 not recorded). Of the 197 participants, 196 (99.5%) identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. Notably, 71 (36.0%, 29.3% to 43.2%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, 33 (16.8%, 11.8% to 22.7%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%, 11.0% to 21.6%) penile oedema. Overall, 31\/111 (27.9%, 19.8% to 37.2%) participants with genital lesions had penile oedema and 60\/82 (73.2%, 62.2% to 82.4%) participants with perianal lesions had rectal pain. Systemic illness was reported by 170 (86.3%) participants. The most commonly described systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%, 54.8% to 68.7%), lymphadenopathy (n=114, 57.9%, 50.6% to 64.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%, 25.1% to 38.5%) ( table 2 ). In contrast with existing case reports suggesting that prodromal systemic symptoms precede skin lesions, we observed a variable temporal association between mucocutaneous and systemic features. In 102\/166 (61.5%, 53.6% to 68.9%) participants, symptoms developed before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestation and in 64 (38.5%, 31.1% to 46.4%) after (n=4, unknown). Twenty seven participants (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic symptoms. The median number of lesions at presentation was 5 (interquartile range 3-11). Eight (4.1%) participants had more than 100 lesions. A numerical count of lesions was not documented for 29 participants. Twenty two (11.2%, 7.1% to 16.4%) participants presented with a solitary lesion: 12 involved the genitals and seven the perianal area. Twenty seven (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) participants described mucocutaneous manifestations as being pruritic and 27 (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) reported a concomitant widespread maculopapular rash. All 197 participants (100%, 95% confidence interval 97.8% to 100%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations. These had a range of documented descriptions (see supplementary figure 2) and not all lesions progressed through the traditionally recognised evolution of macule to papule to vesicle to pustule to scab. Lesions were most commonly found on the genitals (n=111, 56.4%, 49.1% to 63.4%) and anus or perianal area (n=82, 41.6%, 34.7% to 48.8%). Genital lesions or perianal lesions, or both, occurred in 174 participants (88.3%, 83.0% to 92.4%) ( table 1 ). Of 295 people tested for monkeypox virus by PCR between 13 May and 1 July 2022, 197 (66.8%) tested positive. Overall, 155 (78.7%) of the participants presented via affiliated sexual health and HIV medicine services, 24 (12.2%) via an emergency department, and 18 (9.1%) after acute admission to a ward. Novel presentations We describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men. Penile oedema Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis. One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment. Fig 1 Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant\u2019s arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over. Secondary bacterial infection One participant, a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 755 cells\/\u03bcL), was referred for review with extensive genital lesions, penile swelling, and purulent penile discharge. He attended the emergency department when he first noticed spreading vesicles on his scrotum. A swab taken from the lesion confirmed monkeypox virus. The patient re-presented to the emergency department with progressive scrotal swelling, pain, and worsening penile ulceration and was subsequently admitted to hospital. On examination, extensive purulent lesions were identified on the penis and scrotum, with surrounding oedema (fig 2, also see supplementary figure 4). Vesicles were also noted on the arms and torso. No pain was elicited during digital rectal examination. Although there was no urinary retention or dysuria, the patient was catheterised because of concerns about increasing swelling of the penis. He was treated with co-amoxiclav to cover for a superadded bacterial infection but was switched to meropenem and clindamycin because of clinical suspicion of Fournier\u2019s gangrene. A swab sample taken from the penis grew Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Lesions were negative for herpes simplex virus. A computed tomography scan showed extensive penile ulceration, a large hydrocele, and fluid within the scrotum. There was no collection or gas within soft tissue. The participant remains an inpatient at the time of writing. Fig 2 Secondary bacterial infection of penis due to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Also see supplementary figure 4 Rectal perforation Overall, 71 (36.0%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, and this was a common reason for admission (n=8). Five participants had proctitis confirmed on MRI, with one having a perforated rectum and one a perianal abscess. One participant, a 46-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 1200 cells\/\u03bcL), presented with severe rectal pain. Symptoms started with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, followed by severe rectal pain. He was seen in the sexual health service, started on empirical doxycycline for proctitis, and tested for monkeypox virus. Over the next two days the patient developed a papular rash on his upper arms and trunk. A week after symptom onset, the rectal pain became so severe the patient required admission to hospital for pain control. On examination, a papular rash with white exudates was identified in the oral cavity, along with right sided cervical lymphadenopathy. A cluster of tender, white perianal papules were located at the 3 o\u2019clock position. Digital rectal examination elicited noticeable tenderness in the rectum and anal canal. The patient had ongoing fevers and continued to develop new skin lesions. He was started on tecovirimat 600 mg twice daily for 14 days. Results were negative for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). No evidence of concomitant T pallidum infection was found. MRI on day 12 of symptoms showed active proctitis with evidence of a localised lower rectal wall perforation and associated collection (fig 3). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Fig 3 T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan of pelvis showing a 3.5 cm cavity in left mesorectum, adjacent to the rectal wall representing an area of localised perforation (arrow) Solitary lesion In total, 22 (11.2%) participants presented with a solitary cutaneous lesion. One participant, a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a single skin lesion on his thigh. Initially this was a small papule on the medial right thigh but developed into a painful mass with surrounding erythema. After review by a general practitioner, the patient started flucloxacillin, but with no benefit. He presented to the emergency department because the lesion had increased in size. He had no associated fever or other systemic symptoms. On examination a 4\u00d72 cm, tender area of induration with a central area of crusting was noted, along with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 4). The patient was admitted to hospital for treatment with intravenous antibiotics and further investigation. Ultrasound imaging showed inflamed subcutaneous tissues within the upper right thigh, with a tract to a further lesion in the upper right outer thigh, and reactive groin lymph nodes (see supplementary figure 5). Samples were negative for Leishmania, Rickettsiae, and T pallidum, and for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). The patient was discharged with oral co-amoxiclav. However, because of ongoing symptoms and the increase of monkeypox infection in the UK, he was reassessed and tested for monkeypox virus, with a positive result 13 days after symptom onset. How the patient became infected is unclear and there was no known sexual or other exposure to the virus. The patient was reviewed on day 18 by virtual consultation, at which time the crust on the thigh lesion had fallen off. Fig 4 Development of solitary lesion on right upper inner thigh, tracking laterally to outer thigh. Also see supplementary figure 5 Polymorphic lesions Seventy (35.5%) participants had cutaneous manifestations at different stages of evolution at a single time point documented in the clinical notes. One participant, a 48-year-old man, presented with polymorphic skin lesions having first noticed a single erosion on his scrotum, which spread to the penile base and foreskin. On day 3 he developed pustular lesions with an erythematous base on his arms, behind his knee, below his ear, and on the bridge of his nose (fig 5). He attended the sexual health service and emergency department with ulcerated genital lesions and was treated with flucloxacillin. On day 5 he developed systemic symptoms, including fever, myalgia, back pain, headaches, and lethargy. By day 17 the genital lesions had crusted over; however, the patient developed new pustular lesions on his hands. By day 24, the lesions on the hands, legs, and face had crusted over. The previously crusted scrotal and penile lesions became ulcerated, and the patient was treated with co-amoxiclav for a suspected secondary bacterial infection. A swab grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Screening results were negative for herpes simplex virus, T pallidum, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis. Fig 5 Cutaneous lesions on the nose, hand, and penis over time. On day 17 there were fresh pustular lesions on the hand, a partly scabbed lesion on the face, and fully scabbed lesions on the penis Maculopapular rash Twenty seven (13.7%) participants reported an erythematous maculopapular rash of varying distribution and rapid onset, separate to areas of blistering or pustules. One of these participants had positive syphilis serology (n=4 unknown). One participant, a 36-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count >400 cells\/\u03bcL), reported a rapidly progressive maculopapular rash soon after developing perianal vesicles. The vesicles initially progressed into three pruritic, pustular, perianal lesions. On day 4 the patient presented to the sexual health service with rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and difficulty defecating. He was treated empirically for proctitis with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and aciclovir 400 mg three times daily. On day 6 the patient awoke to a widespread symmetrical, pruritic maculopapular rash across his torso, back, legs, and buttocks, and reported inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 6; also see supplementary figure 6). He denied any fever or systemic features. Results for herpes simplex virus, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis (3 in 1 sampling) and T pallidum were negative. By day 8 the perianal lesions had begun to crust over, tenesmus had improved, and the rash had started to diminish. Fig 6 Symmetrical maculopapular rash of the torso, back, and buttocks. Also see supplementary figure 6 Oropharyngeal manifestations Twenty seven (13.7%) participants had oropharyngeal lesions and nine (4.6%) had tonsillar erythema, pustules, oedema, or abscess. One participant, a 25-year-old man, presented with a right sided tonsillar abscess. He described developing right sided neck pain, quickly followed by an erythematous, pruritic rash over his trunk. He subsequently developed fever, progressively worsening right submandibular swelling, and pain, and he reported fatigue. The swelling increased, resulting in dysphagia and difficulty breathing. The patient was referred to his local ear, nose, and throat centre where a right tonsillar abscess was observed. A single papule was noted on the patient\u2019s right forearm. A swab taken from the papule tested positive for monkeypox virus, and the patient was transferred to the high consequence infectious diseases ward. On examination he had a widespread symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash over his chest (sparing the midline), back, and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema (fig 7). Smaller areas of a petechial rash were also noted. The right tonsil was enlarged, with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate, with associated right cervical lymphadenopathy (fig 7). A small, crusted lesion was evident on each antecubital fossa. The patient had no genital or anal lesions. He was treated with benzylpenicillin and metronidazole. Tonsillar and skin swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Over the course of hospital admission, the rash subsided and the dysphagia improved. Two repeat throat swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were negative. Additionally, test results for blood cultures, respiratory viral screen, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus PCR, and HIV, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and mumps IgM were all negative. Fig 7 (Left) Symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash on back and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema. (Right) Right tonsillar enlargement with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate with slight deviation of the uvula Abscesses Two participants had soft tissue abscesses identified on ultrasound examination. One of these participants, a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a left sided groin abscess 10 days after he had shaved the area. The patient attended the emergency department for a left inguinal swelling, which had enlarged over three days, and the patient had associated fever and headache. The swelling had an overlying pustule, which the patient had described as an ingrown hair follicle. On examination, the swelling, measuring 6\u00d78 cm, was incised and drained by the surgical team. The next evening the patient developed papules and pustules over the mons pubis and face, followed by his neck, wrists, and back (eight lesions in total). Test results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling) were negative. About five days later all the lesions had crusted over.",

        "text":"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , Director , General , World Health Organization On 23 July, I declared the global monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and issued recommendations to all countries, with the objective of stopping transmission and controlling the outbreak. Monkeypox has been known to infect humans for more than 50 years, but until this year, was little known or understood outside Africa, and received scant attention or investment. On 13 May, the United Kingdom reported a case of monkeypox in an individual with recent travel history to Nigeria, one of several African countries where the virus is known to be endemic. Since then, the outbreak has expanded rapidly. At the time of writing, more than 26 000 cases have been reported from 85 countries and territories, with 12 deaths, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing down. The majority of reported cases\u2014over 97%\u2014are among men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those with multiple sexual partners, underscoring the need for all countries to work closely with affected communities to design and deliver effective information and services, to guard against stigma and discrimination, and to adopt measures that protect their health, human rights, and dignity. In most cases the disease is self-limiting; however, symptoms can be severe and about 10% of cases are admitted to hospital to manage the excruciating pain caused by the disease or secondary infections. Two smallpox vaccines have been approved for use against monkeypox and a third is under consideration. However, data are lacking on the efficacy of these vaccines for monkeypox, and an effective immune response can take several weeks to develop, meaning vaccination will not provide instant protection against infection or disease. WHO is working with manufacturers to accelerate equitable access to vaccines, and with affected countries to generate data on their efficacy. The primary focus for all countries, therefore, must be to stop transmission using effective public health tools, including enhanced disease surveillance, careful contact tracing, tailored risk communication and community engagement, and risk reduction measures. It is also critical to ensure all affected communities have equitable access to other tools needed to stop transmission, including testing, antivirals, and supportive care. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the decision to declare a PHEIC rests with the WHO Director-General, taking into consideration the information provided by countries; the risk to human health, international spread, and the potential for interference with international traffic; scientific principles, evidence, and other relevant information; and the advice of the Emergency Committee, a panel of external experts convened by the Director-General to advise her or him on whether the public health event in question constitutes a PHEIC. On this occasion, the Emergency Committee was, for the first time since the IHR entered into force in 2007, unable to reach consensus. The rapid international spread of the virus, the risk of further spread with unknown impact, the potential for the virus to become entrenched in previously unaffected regions, and the fact that the outbreak clearly met the definition of a PHEIC outlined in the IHR, all led me to the decision that the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under the IHR, and the only one. It\u2019s clear that although the IHR remains a vital tool for controlling the international spread of disease, it is a tool that must be sharpened to make it more effective. In particular, the binary nature of the determination of a PHEIC is too blunt for evaluating the spectrum of risk posed by emergencies of different kinds. Alongside the process of negotiating a new international accord on pandemic preparedness and response, WHO\u2019s Member States are also considering targeted amendments to the IHR, including ways to improve the process for declaring a PHEIC. More importantly, this outbreak is another demonstration that breaking the cycle of \u201cpanic and neglect\u201d that for decades has been the hallmark of the global response to epidemics and pandemics requires a paradigm shift in global health. The world ignores at its peril pathogens that spread \u201conly\u201d in low-income countries; most are one flight away from sparking a global public health emergency. Protecting the health of any population relies ultimately on protecting the health of every population, through stronger public health functions and health systems, based on robust primary health care and a commitment to universal health coverage. Global health security depends on local health security in every country.",

        "title":"Effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "link":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj-2021-068302",
        "text":"Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination. Results 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a \u201cpackage of interventions.\u201d Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I 2 =12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I 2 =84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I 2 =87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively. Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran\u2019s Q test and the I 2 metrics, with two tailed P values. Previous systematic reviews on the effectiveness of public health measures to treat covid-19 lacked the inclusion of analytical studies, 20 a comprehensive approach to data synthesis (focusing only on one measure), 21 a rigorous assessment of effectiveness of public health measures, 22 an assessment of the certainty of the evidence, 23 and robust methods for comparative analysis. 24 To tackle these gaps, we performed a systematic review of the evidence on the effectiveness of both individual and multiple public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. When feasible we also did a critical appraisal of the evidence and meta-analysis. Substantial benefits in reducing mortality were observed in countries with universal lockdowns in place, such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and China. Universal lockdowns are not, however, sustainable, and more tailored interventions need to be considered; the ones that maintain social lives and keep economies functional while protecting high risk individuals. 16 17 Substantial variation exists in how different countries and governments have applied public health measures, 18 and it has proved a challenge for assessing the effectiveness of individual public health measures, particularly in policy decision making. 19 Public health (or non-pharmaceutical) interventions have been shown to be beneficial in fighting respiratory infections transmitted through contact, droplets, and aerosols. 14 15 Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, it is a challenge to determine which measures might be more effective and sustainable for further prevention. Globally, vaccination programmes have proved to be safe and effective and save lives. 4 5 Yet most vaccines do not confer 100% protection, and it is not known how vaccines will prevent future transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 6 given emerging variants. 7 8 9 The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against covid-19 to reach herd immunity depends greatly on current and future variants. 10 This vaccination threshold varies according to the country and population\u2019s response, types of vaccines, groups prioritised for vaccination, and viral mutations, among other factors. 6 Until herd immunity to covid-19 is reached, regardless of the already proven high vaccination rates, 11 public health preventive strategies are likely to remain as first choice measures in disease prevention, 12 particularly in places with a low uptake of covid-19 vaccination. Measures such as lockdown (local and national variant), physical distancing, mandatory use of face masks, and hand hygiene have been implemented as primary preventive strategies to curb the covid-19 pandemic. 13 A variety of containment and mitigation strategies have been adopted to adequately respond to covid-19, with the intention of deferring major surges of patients in hospitals and protecting the most vulnerable people from infection, including elderly people and those with comorbidities. 3 Strategies to achieve these goals are diverse, commonly based on national risk assessments that include estimation of numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and availability of hospital beds and ventilation support. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on global public health and economies has been profound. 1 As of 14 October 2021, there were 239 007 759 million cases of confirmed covid-19 and 4 871 841 million deaths with covid-19 worldwide. 2 No patients or members of the public were directly involved in this study as no primary data were collected. A member of the public was, however, asked to read the manuscript after submission. Because of the differences in the effect metrics reported by the included studies, we could only perform quantitative data synthesis for three interventions: handwashing, face mask wearing, and physical distancing. Odds ratios or relative risks with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported for the associations between the public health measures and incidence of covid-19. When necessary, we transformed effect metrics derived from different studies to allow pooled analysis. We used the Dersimonian Laird random effects model to estimate pooled effect estimates along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each measure. Heterogeneity among individual studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and the I 2 test. 31 All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.3) and all P values were two tailed, with P=0.05 considered to be significant. For the remaining studies, when meta-analysis was not feasible, we reported the results in a narrative synthesis. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used for random effects meta-analysis, in which the standard error of the study specific estimates was adjusted to incorporate a measure of the extent of variation, or heterogeneity, among the effects observed for public health measures across different studies. It was assumed that the differences between studies are a result of different, yet related, intervention effects being estimated. If fewer than five studies were included in meta-analysis, we applied a recommended modified Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. 30 SS, JR, XL, WX, IME, and XZ independently assessed risk of bias for each study, which was cross checked by ST and HW. For non-interventional observational studies, a ROBINS-I (risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions) risk of bias tool was used. 28 For interventional studies, a revised tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2) tool was used. 29 Reviewers rated each domain for overall risk of bias as low, moderate, high, or serious\/critical. Authors ST, DG, SS, AM, ET, JR, XL, WX, IME, and XZ independently screened the titles and abstracts and excluded studies that did not match the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved in discussion with the main author (ST). The same authors retrieved full text articles and determined whether to include or exclude studies on the basis of predetermined selection criteria. Using a pilot tested data extraction form, authors ST, SS, AM, JR, XL, WX, AM, IME, and XZ independently extracted data on study design, intervention, effect measures, outcomes, results, and limitations. ST, SS, AM, and HW verified the extracted data. Table 5 in supplementary material 1 provides the specific criteria used to assess study designs. Given the heterogeneity and diversity in how studies defined public health measures, we took a common approach to summarise evidence of these interventions (supplementary material 1, table 6). We carried out electronic searches of Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ebsco), Global Health, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, and the WHO COVID-19 database (for preprints). A clinical epidemiologist (ST) developed the initial search strategy, which was validated by two senior medical librarians (LR and MD) (supplementary material 1, table 4). The updated search strategy was last performed on 7 June 2021. All citations identified from the database searches were uploaded to Covidence, an online software designed for managing systematic reviews, 27 for study selection. Given that the scientific community is concerned about the ability of the numerous mathematical models, which are based on assumptions, to predict the course of virus transmission or effectiveness of interventions, 26 this review focused only on empirical studies. We excluded case reports and case studies, modelling and simulation studies, studies that provided a graphical summary of measures without clear statistical assessments or outputs, ecological studies that provided a descriptive summary of the measures without assessing linearity or having comparators, non\u2010empirical studies (eg, commentaries, editorials, government reports), other reviews, articles involving only individuals exposed to other pathogens that can cause respiratory infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, and articles in a language other than English. Articles that met the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design criteria were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review (supplementary material 1, table 3). Specifically, preventive public health measures that were tested independently were included in the main analysis. Multiple measures, which generally contain a \u201cpackage of interventions\u201d, were included as supplementary material owing to the inability to report on the individual effectiveness of measures and comparisons on which package led to enhanced outcomes. The public health measures were identified from published World Health Organization sources that reported on the effectiveness of such measures on a range of communicable diseases, mostly respiratory infections, such as influenza. Overall, 37 studies provided estimates on the effectiveness of multiple public health measures, assessed as a collective group. Studies were mostly conducted in Asia (n=15), the US (n=11), Europe (n=6), Africa (n=4), and South America (n=1). All the studies were observational. The most commonly measured outcome was transmission of disease (ie, measured as reproductive number, growth number, or epidemic doubling time) (n=23), followed by covid-19 incidence (n=19) and covid-19 mortality (n=8). This review attempted to assess the overall effectiveness of the public health intervention packages by reporting the percentage difference in outcome before and after implementation of measures or between regions or countries studied. Eleven of the 37 included studies noted a difference of between 26% and 50% in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and incidence of covid-19, 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 nine noted a difference of between 51% and 75% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, covid-19 incidence, and covid-19 mortality, 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 and 14 noted a difference of more than 75% in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 incidence and covid-19 mortality. 79 80 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 For the remaining studies, the overall effectiveness was not assessed owing to a lack of comparators (see supplementary material 3, table 3). Two studies that assessed universal lockdown and physical distancing reported a decrease of between 0% and 25% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 incidence. 79 101 Studies that included school and workplace closures, 91 95 96 isolation or stay at home measures, 80 94 or a combination of both 79 89 93 97 98 99 reported decreases of more than 75% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Supplementary material 3, table 2 provides detailed information on each study. One retrospective cohort study assessed screening of symptoms, which involved testing 65 000 people for fever ( table 3 ). 54 The study found that screening for fever lacked sensitivity (ranging from 18% to 24%) in detecting people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This translated to 86% of the population with SARS-CoV-2 remaining undetected when screening for fever. The study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Border closure was assessed in one natural experiment study involving nine African countries ( table 3 ). 62 Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence of covid-19 after border closure. These studies concluded that the implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of covid-19. The study had important limitations and was rated at serious or critical risk of bias. In the US, a natural experiment study reported that restrictions on travel between states contributed about 11% to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission ( table 3 ). 36 The study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Four studies assessed universal lockdown and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the first few months of the pandemic ( table 2 ). The decrease in reproductive number (R0) ranged from 1.27 in Italy (pre-intervention 2.03, post-intervention 0.76) 39 to 2.09 in India (pre-intervention 3.36, post-intervention 1.27), 64 and 3.97 in China (pre-intervention 4.95, post-intervention 0.98). 33 A natural experiment from the US reported that lockdown was associated with an 11% reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (relative risk 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91). 40 All the studies were rated at low risk of bias 33 39 to moderate risk 40 64 ( fig 2 ). The three studies that assessed universal lockdown and covid-19 mortality generally reported a decrease in mortality ( table 2 ). 35 38 42 A natural experiment study involving 45 US states reported a decrease in covid-19 related mortality of 2.0% (95% confidence interval \u22123.0% to 0.9%) daily after lockdown had been made mandatory. 35 A Brazilian quasi-experimental study reported a 27.4% average difference in covid-19 related mortality rates in the first 25 days of lockdown. 42 In addition, a natural experiment study reported about 30% and 60% reductions in covid-19 related mortality post-lockdown in Italy and Spain over four weeks post-intervention, respectively. 38 All three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A natural experiment involving 202 countries suggested that countries that implemented universal lockdown had fewer new cases of covid-19 than countries that did not (\u03b2 coefficient \u2212235.8 (standard error \u221211.04), P<0.01) ( table 2 ). 52 An Indian quasi-experimental study reported a 10.8% reduction in incidence of covid-19 post-lockdown, 56 whereas a South African retrospective cohort study observed a 14.1% reduction in risk after implementation of universal lockdown ( table 2 ). 46 These studies were rated at high risk of bias 52 and moderate risk of bias 46 56 ( fig 2 ). Two natural experiment studies assessed business closures across 50 US states and reported reductions in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ( table 2 ). 40 58 One of the studies observed a significant reduction in transmission of 12% (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89) 40 and the other reported a significant 16% (risk ratio 0.84, 0.79 to 0.90) reduction. 58 Both studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Two natural experiments from the US reported a reduction in transmission (ie, reproductive number); with one study reporting a reduction of 13% (relative risk 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89) 40 and another reporting a 10% (0.90, 0.86 to 0.93) reduction ( table 2 ). 58 A Swedish study reported an association between school closures and a small increase in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in parents (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.32), but observed that teachers in lower secondary schools were twice as likely to become infected than teachers in upper secondary schools (2.01, 1.52 to 2.67). 32 All three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Two studies assessed the effectiveness of school closures on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, incidence of covid-19, or covid-19 mortality ( table 2 ). 44 48 A US population based longitudinal study reported on the effectiveness of state-wide closure of primary and secondary schools and observed a 62% decrease (95% confidence interval \u221249% to \u221271%) in incidence of covid-19 and a 58% decrease (\u221246% to\u221268%) in covid-19 mortality. 48 Conversely, a natural experiment from Japan reported no effect of school closures on incidence of covid-19 (\u03b1 coefficient 0.08, 95% confidence interval \u22120.36 to 0.65). 44 Both studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Quarantine was assessed in two studies ( table 2 ). 34 59 A prospective cohort study from Saudi Arabia reported a 4.9% decrease in the incidence of covid-19 at eight weeks after the implementation of quarantine. 34 This study was rated at low risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A retrospective cohort study from India reported a 14 times higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with no quarantine compared with strict quarantine (odds ratio 14.44, 95% confidence interval 2.42 to 86.17). 59 This study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A study from the UK reported a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed for each participant and estimated a decrease in reproductive number: the reproductive number pre-intervention was 3.6 and post-intervention was 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.89). 65 Similarly, an Iranian study projected the reproductive number using serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases and found a significant decrease: the reproductive number pre-intervention was 2.70 and post-intervention was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.25). 55 Three of the studies were rated at moderate to serious or critical risk of bias, 55 58 65 and one study was rated at low risk of bias 41 ( fig 2 ). All the studies that assessed stay at home or isolation measures reported reductions in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ( table 2 ). A retrospective cohort study from the US reported a significant reduction in the odds of having a positive reproductive number (R0) result (odds ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.37), 41 and a natural experiment reported a 51% reduction in time varying reproductive number (Rt) (risk ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.54). 58 Studies that assessed physical distancing but were not included in the meta-analysis because of substantial differences in outcomes assessed, generally reported a positive effect of physical distancing ( table 2 ). A natural experiment from the US reported a 12% decrease in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89), 40 and a quasi-experimental study from Iran reported a reduction in covid-19 related mortality (\u03b2 \u22120.07, 95% confidence interval \u22120.05 to \u22120.10; P<0.001). 47 Another comparative study in Kenya also reported a reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after physical distancing was implemented, reporting 62% reduction in overall physical contacts (reproductive number pre-intervention was 2.64 and post-intervention was 0.60 (interquartile range 0.50 to 0.68)). 61 These three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias 40 61 to serious or critical risk of bias 47 ( fig 2 ). Five studies with a total of 2727 people with SARS-CoV-2 and 108 933 participants were included in the analysis that examined the effect of physical distancing on the incidence of covid-19. 37 53 57 60 63 Overall pooled analysis indicated a 25% reduction in incidence of covid-19 (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.95, I 2 =87%) ( fig 6 ). Heterogeneity among studies was substantial, and risk of bias ranged from moderate 37 53 57 60 to serious or critical 63 ( fig 2 ). Only one study, from China, reported the association between disinfection of surfaces and risk of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households ( table 1 ). 57 The study assessed disinfection retrospectively by asking participants about their \u201cdaily use of chlorine or ethanol-based disinfectant in households,\u201d and observed that use of disinfectant was 77% effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission (odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.84). The study did not collect data on the concentration of the disinfectant used by participants and was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A comparative study in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region reported a statistically significant lower cumulative incidence of covid-19 associated with mask wearing than in selected countries where mask wearing was not mandatory ( table 1 ). 68 Similarly, another natural experiment involving 15 US states reported a 2% statistically significant daily decrease in covid-19 transmission (measured as case growth rate) at \u226521 days after mask wearing became mandatory, 50 whereas a cross sectional study reported that a 10% increase in self-reported mask wearing was associated with greater odds for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted odds ratio 3.53, 95% confidence interval 2.03 to 6.43). 45 The five studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Mask wearing and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 incidence, and covid-19 mortality\u2014The results of additional studies that assessed mask wearing (not included in the meta-analysis because of substantial differences in the assessed outcomes) indicate a reduction in covid-19 incidence, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. Specifically, a natural experiment across 200 countries showed 45.7% fewer covid-19 related mortality in countries where mask wearing was mandatory ( table 1 ). 49 Another natural experiment study in the US reported a 29% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as the time varying reproductive number Rt) (risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.75) in states where mask wearing was mandatory. 58 Mask wearing and covid-19 incidence\u2014Six studies with a total of 2627 people with covid-19 and 389 228 participants were included in the analysis examining the effect of mask wearing on incidence of covid-19 ( table 1 ). 36 43 57 60 63 66 Overall pooled analysis showed a 53% reduction in covid-19 incidence (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75), although heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I 2 =84%) ( fig 5 ). Risk of bias across the six studies ranged from moderate 36 57 60 66 to serious or critical 43 63 ( fig 2 ). Handwashing and covid-19 incidence\u2014Three studies with a total of 292 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 10 345 participants were included in the analysis of the effect of handwashing on incidence of covid-19. 36 60 63 Overall pooled analysis suggested an estimated 53% non-statistically significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I 2 =12%) ( fig 3 ). A sensitivity analysis without adjustment showed a significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (0.49, 0.33 to 0.72, I 2 =12%) ( fig 4 ). Risk of bias across the three studies ranged from moderate 36 60 to serious or critical 63 ( fig 2 ). Thirty five studies provided estimates on the effectiveness of an individual public health measures. The studies were conducted in Asia (n=11), the United States (n=9), Europe (n=7), the Middle East (n=3), Africa (n=3), South America (n=1), and Australia (n=1). Thirty four of the studies were observational and one was a randomised controlled trial. The study designs of the observational studies comprised natural experiments (n=11), quasi-experiments (n=3), a prospective cohort (n=1), retrospective cohorts (n=8), case-control (n=2), and cross sectional (n=9). Twenty six studies assessed social measures, 32 34 35 37 38 39 40 41 42 44 46 47 48 52 53 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 63 64 65 67 12 studies assessed personal protective measures, 36 43 45 49 50 57 58 60 63 66 68 three studies assessed travel related measures, 54 58 62 and one study assessed environmental measures 57 (some interventions overlapped across studies). The most commonly measured outcome was incidence of covid-19 (n=18), followed by SARS-CoV-2 transmission, measured as reproductive number, growth number, or epidemic doubling time (n=13), and covid-19 mortality (n=8). Table 1 in supplementary material 3 provides detailed information on each study. According to the ROBINS-I tool, 28 the risk of bias was rated as low in three studies, 32 33 34 moderate in 24 studies, 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 and high to serious in seven studies. 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 One important source of serious or critical risk of bias in most of the included studies was major confounding, which was difficult to control for because of the novel nature of the pandemic (ie, natural settings in which multiple interventions might have been enforced at once, different levels of enforcement across regions, and uncaptured individual level interventions such as increased personal hygiene). Variations in testing capacity and coverage, changes to diagnostic criteria, and access to accurate and reliable outcome data on covid-19 incidence and covid-19 mortality, was a source of measurement bias for numerous studies ( fig 2 ). These limitations were particularly prominent early in the pandemic, and in low income environments. 47 52 62 63 65 The randomised controlled trial 66 was rated as moderate risk of bias according to the ROB-2 tool. Missing data, losses to follow-up, lack of blinding, and low adherence to intervention all contributed to the reported moderate risk. Tables 1 and 2 in supplementary material 2 summarise the risk of bias assessment for each study assessing individual measures. A total of 36 729 studies were initially screened, of which 36 079 were considered irrelevent. After exclusions, 650 studies were eligible for full text review and 72 met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 35 assessed individual interventions and were included in the final synthesis of results ( fig 1 ) and 37 assessed multiple interventions as a package and are included in supplementary material 3, tables 2 and 3. The included studies comprised 34 observational studies and one interventional study, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. Discussion Worldwide, government and public health organisations are mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by implementing various public health measures. This systematic review identified a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of covid-19 through the implementation of mask wearing and physical distancing. Handwashing interventions also indicated a substantial reduction in covid-19 incidence, albeit not statistically significant in the adjusted model. As the random effects model tends to underestimate confidence intervals when a meta-analysis includes a small number of individual studies (<5), the adjusted model for handwashing showed a statistically non-significant association in reducing the incidence of covid-19 compared with the unadjusted model. Overall effectiveness of these interventions was affected by clinical heterogeneity and methodological limitations, such as confounding and measurement bias. It was not possible to evaluate the impact of type of face maks (eg, surgical, fabric, N95 respirators) and compliance and frequency of wearing masks owing to a lack of data. Similarly, it was not feasible to assess the differences in effect that different recommendations for physical distancing (ie, 1.5 m, 2m, or 3 m) have as preventive strategies. The effectiveness of measures such as universal lockdowns and closures of businesses and schools for the containment of covid-19 have largely been effective, but depended on early implementation when incidence rates of covid-19 were still low.425258 Only Japan reported no decrease in covid-19 incidence after school closures,44 and other studies found that different public health measures were sometimes implemented simultaneously or soon after one another, thus the results should be interpreted with caution.324656 Isolation or stay at home was an effective measure in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the included studies used results for mobility to assess stay at home or isolation and therefore could have been limited by potential flaws in publicly available phone data,4158102 and variations in the enforcement of public health measures in different states or regions were not assessed.5558102 Quarantine was found to be as effective in reducing the incidence of covid-19 and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet variation in testing and case detection in low income environments was substantial.599698 Another study reported that quarantine was effective in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort with a low prevalence of the virus, yet it is unknown if the same effect would be observed with higher prevalence.34 It was not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of restricted travel and full border closures because the number of empirical studies was insufficient. Single studies identified that border closure in Africa had a minimal effect in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the study was assessed as being at high risk of bias.62 Screening for fever was also identified to be ineffective, with only 24% of positive cases being captured by screening.54 Comparison with other studies Previous literature reviews have identified mask wearing as an effective measure for the containment of SARS-CoV-2103; the caveat being that more high level evidence is required to provide unequivocal support for the effectiveness of the universal use of face masks.104105 Additional empirical evidence from a recent randomised controlled trial (originally published as a preprint) indicates that mask wearing achieved a 9.3% reduction in seroprevalence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and an 11.9% reduction in the prevalence of covid-19-like symptoms.106 Another systematic review showed stronger effectiveness with the use of N95, or similar, respirators than disposable surgical masks,107 and a study evaluating the protection offered by 18 different types of fabric masks found substantial heterogeneity in protection, with the most effective mask being multilayered and tight fitting.108 However, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 largely arises in hospital settings in which full personal protective measures are in place, which suggests that when viral load is at its highest, even the best performing face masks might not provide adequate protection.51 Additionally, most studies that assessed mask wearing were prone to important confounding bias, which might have altered the conclusions drawn from this review (ie, effect estimates might have been underestimated or overestimated or can be related to other measures that were in place at the time the studies were conducted). Thus, the extent of such limitations on the conclusions drawn remain unknown. A 2020 rapid review concluded that quarantine is largely effective in reducing the incidence of covid-19 and covid-19 mortality. However, uncertainty over the magnitude of such an effect still remains,109 with enhanced management of quality quarantine facilities for improved effective control of the epidemics urgently needed.110 In addition, findings on the application of school and workplace closures are still inconclusive. Policy makers should be aware of the ambiguous evidence when considering school closures, as other potentially less disruptive physical distancing interventions might be more appropriate.21 Numerous findings from studies on the efficacy of school closures showed that the risk of transmission within the educational environment often strongly depends on the incidence of covid-19 in the community, and that school closures are most successfully associated with control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when other mitigation strategies are in place in the community.111112113114115116117 School closures have been reported to be disruptive to students globally and are likely to impair children\u2019s social, psychological, and educational development118119 and to result in loss of income and productivity in adults who cannot work because of childcare responsibilities.120 Speculation remains as how best to implement physical distancing measures.121 Studies that assess physical distancing measures might interchangeably study physical distancing with lockdown35525664 and other measures and thus direct associations are difficult to assess. Empirical evidence from restricted travel and full border closures is also limited, as it is almost impossible to study these strategies as single measures. Current evidence from a recent narrative literature review suggested that control of movement, along with mandated quarantine, travel restrictions, and restricting nationals from entering areas of high infection, are effective measures, but only with good compliance.122 A narrative literature review of travel bans, partial lockdowns, and quarantine also suggested effectiveness of these measures,123 and another rapid review further supported travel restrictions and cross border restrictions to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.124 It was impossible to make such observations in the current review because of limited evidence. A German review, however, suggested that entry, exit, and symptom screening measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are not effective at detecting a meaningful proportion of cases,125 and another review using real world data from multiple countries found that border closures had minimal impact on the control of covid-19.126 Although universal lockdowns have shown a protective effect in lowering the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality, these measures are also disruptive to the psychosocial and mental health of children and adolescents,127 global economies,128 and societies.129 Partial lockdowns could be an alternative, as the associated effectiveness can be high,125 especially when implemented early in an outbreak,85 and such measures would be less disruptive to the general population. It is important to also consider numerous sociopolitical and socioeconomic factors that have been shown to increase SARS-CoV-2 infection130131 and covid-19 mortality.132 Immigration status,82 economic status,81101 and poverty and rurality98 can influence individual and community compliance with public health measures. Poverty can impact the ability of communities to physically distance,133 especially in crowded living environments,134135 as well as reduce access to personal protective measures.134135 A recent study highlights that \u201ca one size fits all\u201d approach to public health measures might not be effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in vulnerable communities136 and could exacerbate social and economic inequalities.135137 As such, a more nuanced and community specific approach might be required. Even though screening is highly recommended by WHO138 because a proportion of patients with covid-19 can be asymptomatic,138 screening for symptoms might miss a larger proportion of the population with covid-19. Hence, temperature screening technologies might need to be reconsidered and evaluated for cost effectiveness, given such measures are largely depended on symptomatic fever cases. Strengths and limitations of this review The main strength of this systematic review was the use of a comprehensive search strategy to identify and select studies for review and thereby minimise selection bias. A clinical epidemiologist developed the search strategy, which was validated by two senior medical librarians. This review followed a comprehensive appraisal process that is recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration31 to assess the effectiveness of public health measures, with specifically validated tools used to independently and individually assess the risk of bias in each study by study design. This review has some limitations. Firstly, high quality evidence on SARS CoV-2 and the effectiveness of public health measures is still limited, with most studies having different underlying target variables. Secondly, information provided in this review is based on current evidence, so will be modified as additional data become available, especially from more prospective and randomised studies. Also, we excluded studies that did not provide certainty over the effect measure, which might have introduced selection bias and limited the interpretation of effectiveness. Thirdly, numerous studies measured interventions only once and others multiple times over short time frames (days v month, or no timeframe). Additionally, the meta-analytical portion of this study was limited by significant heterogeneity observed across studies, which could neither be explored nor explained by subgroup analyses or meta-regression. Finally, we quantitatively assessed only publications that reported individual measures; studies that assessed multiple measures simultaneously were narratively analysed with a broader level of effectiveness (see supplementary material 3, table 3). Also, we excluded studies in languages other than English. Methodological limitations of studies included in the review Several studies failed to define and assess for potential confounders, which made it difficult for our review to draw a one directional or causal conclusion. This problem was mainly because we were unable to study only one intervention, given that many countries implemented several public health measures simultaneously; thus it is a challenge to disentangle the impact of individual interventions (ie, physical distancing when other interventions could be contributing to the effect). Additionally, studies measured different primary outcomes and in varied ways, which limited the ability to statistically analyse other measures and compare effectiveness. Further pragmatic randomised controlled trials and natural experiment studies are needed to better inform the evidence and guide the future implementation of public health measures. Given that most measures depend on a population\u2019s adherence and compliance, it is important to understand and consider how these might be affected by factors. A lack of data in the assessed studies meant it was not possible to understand or determine the level of compliance and adherence to any of the measures.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/378\/bmj-2021-069503",
        "text":"Smell and taste disorders tended to be overlooked by clinicians before the covid-19 pandemic, possibly because these senses were considered as unessential for life compared with vision and hearing.50 As a result of the covid-19 pandemic, patients and doctors may now be aware that these are major problems that could adversely impact quality of life, personal-social functioning, mental health, general health, and safety, long after patients recover from covid-19. In this meta-analysis of time-to-event data from 3699 patients in 18 studies, an estimated 74%, 86%, 90%, and 96% of patients self-reported smell recovery and 79%, 88%, 90%, and 98% self-reported taste recovery at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days, respectively. On the basis of parametric cure models, persistent smell or taste dysfunction might develop in about 5% of patients. Sensitivity analyses suggest this could be an underestimate. Female sex was associated with poorer recovery of both smell and taste, whereas greater initial severity of dysfunction and nasal congestion were associated with poorer smell recovery only. Comparison with other studies This study used comprehensive, flexible statistical modelling to estimate the recovery curves and the proportion of patients who develop persistent smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. We used statistical cure models to investigate recovery from smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19, and potentially our methods could be expanded to cover other major symptoms. Our recovery curves are consistent with the findings of recent studies, which suggest that recovery from smell and taste dysfunction mostly occurs early in the course of covid-19.751 More importantly, our cure models are consistent with other studies that explored the point prevalence of persistent dysfunction at long follow-up durations of six months to one year.22234952 We had excluded these studies as they did not provide appropriate graphs for reconstruction of IPD for this meta-analysis. These studies reported 9.0% of patients having little or no improvement in sense of smell at six months52; and 7.0-8.6% still had functional anosmia or persistent to worsening smell or taste impairment at one year,2249 which corresponds with our cure model predictions of 3-11% of patients who develop persistent dysfunction. This provides support for the external validity of our findings and suggests that these patients are less likely to experience recovery. Nonetheless, recovery even after many years remains possible, based on previous studies of post-viral olfactory loss53; thus patients with covid-19 should be followed-up over the long term. The differential recovery rates could be explained by the underlying mechanisms of smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. Briefly, conductive barriers can prevent odorants and tastants from reaching receptors, and sensorineural interference can block sensory receptor function or signal transmission to the brain. Sensorineural mechanisms are currently thought to be the predominant mechanism of covid-19 related smell dysfunction,5455 although conductive mechanisms have been implicated too.56 SARS-CoV-2 infects and eliminates most olfactory epithelial support (sustentacular) cells that express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, which leads to olfactory neuron deciliation and necrosis.5557 Varying regeneration speed of support cells and sensory neurons, influenced by the degree of inflammation, could explain the delayed smell recovery. Stem cell damage and severe inflammation may also prolong smell dysfunction by slowing the regeneration of olfactory epithelial.57 For taste dysfunction, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the salivary glands could impair salivary flow, leading to \u201cconductive\u201d taste dysfunction.58 Viral binding with oral mucosal cells might trigger inflammation, abnormal cell turnover, and reduced tastebud sensitivity and thus sensorineural taste dysfunction,5859 which may have varying regeneration speed. As these hypotheses have not been explored in association with recovery rates, further mechanistic research is warranted among the different patient subpopulations with rapid recovery or persistent dysfunction. Although it is unsurprising that higher initial severity of smell dysfunction may prolong recovery, it is not clear why female sex is associated with poorer recovery and is notably consistent with previous reports of post-viral smell dysfunction disproportionately affecting women.60 One reason could be the better baseline olfaction and gustation in female participants,6162 which may result in greater sensitivity to changes and a larger subjective impairment. Biological explanations are also possible, as oestrogen upregulates the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, and the enzyme\u2019s gene is located on the X chromosome.63 These findings suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor\u2014the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 virus, may have higher expression in women, or may express heterodimers that alter virus binding,64 thus potentially enhancing viral invasion in women. Furthermore, immune related X linked genes are more activated in the immune cells of women.64 Although acute inflammation promotes olfactory epithelial regeneration, chronic inflammation is detrimental to recovery.6566 These factors could possibly account for the poorer observed recovery in women and should be investigated further. It is also unclear why recovery of taste occurs faster in Asian countries. One possibility is the ethnic differences between continents, which may affect smell or taste perception,67 as well as susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus.68 Alternatively, intercontinental genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 might influence biological mechanisms.168 As many of the included studies did not specify the ethnic distribution of participants, however, further research is required to explain this phenomenon. Our findings suggest an important burden from persistent smell and taste dysfunctions. Presently it is unknown if these sensory impairments might be associated with long term health related consequences. Smell dysfunction could predict the development of depression69 and is potentially associated with neurodegenerative disorders, often heralding neurological and cognitive manifestations by several years.70 Although recent studies of long covid have already reported a substantial burden of brain fog,71 anxiety, and depression,72 it remains uncertain if persistent smell dysfunction after covid-19 might prognosticate an increased risk of long term neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders.13 With more than 550 million people worldwide confirmed as having covid-19 as of July 2022, of whom about 50% report smell or taste dysfunction,2 just 5.6% and 4.4% of patients with persistent smell and taste dysfunction translates to more than 15 million and 12 million patients with long term smell and taste dysfunctions, respectively. These patients may require further investigation, longitudinal follow-up, and appropriate treatment. Finally, these findings should also be considered in the light of recent viral mutations. The omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is associated with a less noticeable reduction in loss of smell and taste compared with the delta and alpha variants.73 This has contributed to increasing difficulty in detecting omicron using a symptom based testing approach. In particular, one large study found that only 13-16% of patients lost their sense of smell and taste during the period when the omicron variant was dominant, compared with 44% when the delta variant dominated.73 This may be secondary to alterations in the omicron spike protein,74 which might result in less effective cell membrane fusion and olfactory host cell entry. Therefore, smell and taste recovery could also follow a different course after an omicron related infection. Although smell and taste dysfunction are less common with omicron, the fourfold transmissibility of omicron compared with the delta variant may still imply a net increase in the prevalence of chemosensory disorders.75 As we found no relevant studies in our systematic search that stratified recovery according to SARS-CoV-2 variant, this remains an important area of future research.",

        "title":"Investigating the monkeypox outbreak",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/377\/bmj.o1314",
        "text":"Christopher Dye , professor of epidemiology , Moritz U G Kraemer , associate professor of computational and genomic epidemiology Department of Biology, University of Oxford, UK Correspondence to: C Dye christopher.dye{at}zoo.ox.ac.uk Here\u2019s what we know, and what we need to know Between 4 and 25 May, 221 confirmed (by reverse transcriptase PCR) and 86 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 23 countries in Europe plus Argentina, Australia, Canada, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.1 Such a large number of cases has never previously been reported from so many countries outside Africa in just a few weeks. New cases are being reported daily; more can be expected and in more locations. Why the extraordinary surge now? What do we need to know to stop it? Almost all patients so far are male (three are female) and presented with symptoms typical of monkeypox, including fever, vesicular rash, skin lesions and ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes.2 The first case in this outbreak was a man who visited Nigeria from the UK.3 He developed a rash on 29 April before leaving Nigeria, arriving back in the UK on 4 May. He was immediately isolated at a London hospital on the same day. His contacts on the flight to the UK, together with others in the community plus healthcare staff, are being followed for 21 days, considered the upper limit of the incubation period for monkeypox.4 By 24 May, none of these contacts had reported symptoms. Another 70 confirmed cases have been reported in the UK (all in England except one in Scotland), in several different groups. There is evidently person-to-person transmission within groups but no known links between groups or with the first case in England. One group is a household of three; another is four men who identify as gay or bisexual and seem to have been infected in London.5 Other than the man who was the first case, none have recently visited, or are known to have contacts that visited, endemic areas of Africa. Informed response Against this background, at least six lines of investigation will help to develop national and global responses in the coming days and weeks. The first is to find out whether the exceptionally large number of exported infections is linked to the increased frequency of travel to and from endemic areas of Africa now that covid restrictions have been lifted. If it is, published travel schedules between countries will help to specify and then mitigate risk around the world. The second is to investigate whether and how the spread of monkeypox is being driven by a rise in case numbers at source in west and central Africa. The number of monkeypox cases increased in Africa between 1970-79 and 2010-19 following the demise of smallpox and the decline in smallpox vaccination, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).67 This rise has included major outbreaks, the largest of which affected 17 states of Nigeria in 2017-18.89 Thirdly, the main routes of transmission need to be re-examined. The 2017-18 Nigerian epidemic was caused by multiple introductions from animals (most likely rodents) to humans, plus limited and perhaps non-sustaining chains of transmission between people.81011 Now, however, waning immunity to smallpox and smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine could have magnified the risk of sustained transmission between people, within and beyond Africa.1213 The relative importance of different transmission routes could also have changed. Close contact is normally needed to acquire infection from skin lesions, body fluids, exhaled droplets, or contaminated clothing and bedding. The discovery of cases among gay and bisexual men, notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, points to sex as one among other forms of close contact, although monkeypox is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease. Fourthly, we need to reassess what proportion of infections cause severe or fatal disease. Historically, two different genomic clades of monkeypox virus have been described in west and central Africa.7 All cases so far genotyped in Europe during the current outbreak are more closely related to the west African clade and to viruses exported from Nigeria to Israel, Singapore, and the UK in 2018 and 2019.1415 The west African clade has been associated with milder illness and a lower case fatality rate (roughly 4%) than the central African clade (roughly 10%).7 If some infections are asymptomatic, as previously described,11 these estimates of case fatality could be too high. Asymptomatic cases might also be missing links in transmission chains. Case fatality, and the risk of severe disease, can be reduced with some antivirals effective against poxviruses, but there is undoubtedly more to be learnt about supportive and therapeutic clinical care.16 The fifth line of investigation is to determine whether monkeypox could evolve, or has recently evolved, to become more pathogenic or more transmissible, or transmissible in a different way. Monkeypox virus is genetically variable and adaptable. The two main African clades consist of multiple lineages and many variants within each lineage. One genetic deletion identified in samples from DRC has been associated with human-to-human transmission.17 Clinical, epidemiological, and genomic surveillance is vital to detect possible changes in mode of transmission, human susceptibility, infectiousness, and pathogenicity.1518 Lastly in this short list, the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting individuals and populations should be further evaluated. Because smallpox is caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to monkeypox, pre-exposure inoculation with vaccinia vaccine is efficacious (about 85%) against monkeypox disease and probably also reduces onward transmission.19 Post-exposure inoculation gives less protection, so vaccine effectiveness in practice\u2014assessed, for example, while tracing and vaccinating contacts of cases20\u2014will depend on what proportion of people at risk can be immunised before rather than after acquiring infection. On present evidence, monkeypox is unlikely to become a global health emergency. Nevertheless, vigilance and open minded investigation are needed worldwide because until these and other questions are answered, we will not know how best to contain the unprecedented spread of this disease.

        "text":"Introduction Seven coronaviruses can infect humans, all belonging to the alpha or beta subgroups, including 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta).1 Over the past two decades, three notable beta coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2011; and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019) have emerged and caused severe illness, resulting in debilitating disease and worldwide deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and has caused more than 5.59 million deaths in around two years and resulted in multisystem illness in several million people.2 All viruses change and mutate over time, with most changes having little to no impact. However, some mutations could alter its pathogenic or transmission potential and might, therefore, increase disease severity or hinder the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization3 classifies variants of concern as SARS-CoV-2 variants that increase transmissibility, disease severity, or virulence or that decrease the effectiveness of public health measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. Variants of interest are variants with genetic changes predicted to enhance the virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which have been identified to cause community transmission in multiple countries and pose a possible risk to global public health. Lastly, variants under monitoring are those with genetic changes are suspected to affect virus characteristics and have currently unclear phenotypic or epidemiological effects. Variants under monitoring are not typically assigned a name until they are upgraded to variants of interest or concern. The full working definitions of variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring can be found on the WHO website for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (www.who.int\/en\/activities\/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\/).3 As of 25 January 2022, WHO reports five variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron), two variants of interest (lambda and mu), and three variants under monitoring.3 Former variants of concern, variants of interest, or variants under monitoring have been reclassified as \"formerly monitored variants,\" owing to these variants no longer circulating, having little impact on the epidemiological situation, or having no concerning properties.3 Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the rapid development of effective covid-19 vaccines has taken place around the world. As of 24 January 2022, 33 vaccines have been approved for use in 197 countries, with 10 vaccines having gained emergency use listing approval from WHO.4 In this review, we provide an overview of the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2, describing how these elements allow the virus to infect and replicate inside of host cells, before outlining how certain mutations harboured by SARS-CoV-2 variants enhance these abilities. Next, we examine the current state of vaccine development around the world and provide evidence of the effectiveness of booster doses. Sources and selection criteria We searched PubMed and Embase databases for covid-19 related articles published between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2022 and for general coronavirus related articles published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Our search terms included SARS-CoV-2, covid-19, and specific terms including virology, genome, variants, and vaccine. Additional, specific search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 1. We performed further manual searching for additional articles and data using relevant databases, including who.int, gov.uk, and ecdc.europa.eu\/en. Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of the literature involving SARS-CoV-2, we also searched preprint databases including MedRxiv and BioRxiv. We selected studies through different criteria (online supplemental file 1), owing to the various topics discussed here. Overall, studies were selected on the basis of quality and impact factor of publishing journal, with real world studies with large sample sizes of the greatest interest. Supplemental material [bmjmed-2021-000040supp001.pdf] Viral transmission, clinical presentation, and genetic susceptibility of covid-19 SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread via respiratory droplet transmission, spreading between people through close contact, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission, fomite transmission, and via other modes, such as through biological material including urine and faeces.5 6 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces or survive suspended in air droplets for long periods. Indeed, on plastic, stainless steel, and glass surfaces, the half life of the virus is around 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 hours, respectively,7 with no difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 variants.8 Although SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on inanimate surfaces for hours and days, owing to the evaporation of water droplets (the viruses\u2019 living environment), the concentration of the virus plummets rapidly.9 Protective measures, including use of personal protective equipment, maintenance of indoor ventilation, and disinfection hands and surfaces, can effectively limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.10 Once inside the airways, SARS-CoV-2 can infect ciliated, mucus secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes within the lungs, and the conjunctival mucosa.11 The clinical presentation of covid-19 is non-specific and heterogeneous, and infection can result in a wide spectrum of symptoms. After an incubation period of 4-14 days, symptoms range from mild to severe disease and, in some instances, can result in death.12 The most common covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue,13 14 while myalgia, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms are reported. Asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for covid-19.15 16 Although the entire population is susceptible to covid-19 infection, some subgroups within the general population are more susceptible to developing poorer clinical outcomes. Risk factors associated with increased probability of hospital admission, severe disease, and fatal outcome with covid-19 have been identified. Older age17\u201319; male sex20 21; belonging to an ethnic minority group21 22; and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease,18 23\u201325 malignancy, and immunodeficiency26\u201328 have all been associated with more severe covid-19. The duration and treatment of covid-19 symptoms will also have profound influences on the severity of disease and the acute and long term outcomes after recovery. The host genetic background is thought to have an influence on the susceptibility and severity of covid-19, possibly explaining the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that can develop in seemingly similar individuals. A meta-analysis, consisting of 49,562 patients with covid-19 across numerous ancestry groups, identified four gene loci associated with susceptibility to covid-19 (SLC6A20, RPL24, ABO, PLEKHA4) and nine associated with increased risk of severe covid-19 (LZTFL1, FOXP4, TMEM65, OAS1, KANSL1, TAC4, DPP9, RAVER1, and IFNAR2).29 Meanwhile, genome wide association studies spanning across Europe, the US, and the UK identified a gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) as being strongly linked with susceptibility and severity of covid-19.30 31 Polymorphisms in the genes of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have also been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 viral entry,32 33 with differential polymorphisms seen across ethnic minority populations, which might partly explain why certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe covid-19. Increased ACE2 receptor levels have also been associated with other risk factors of covid-19, including smoking and increasing age.34 The use of polygenetic risk scores might be useful in determining an individual\u2019s risk for developing severe disease caused by covid-19.35 A polygenetic risk score infers a person\u2019s risk of susceptibility to, or development of, a certain disease based on the total number of genomic variations they possess. Determining polygenetic risk scores with the inclusion of comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,36 or other aspects such as coagulation factors,37 could improve the usefulness of these scores in determining a person\u2019s risk of severe covid-19. Virology of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses, which have crown-like appearances, are the largest known RNA viruses and are thought to primarily infect vertebrates.38 39 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus of the coronaviruses and has a genome size varying from 29.8 to 29.9 kb.40 Human coronavirus genomes consist of a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs). Following the typical 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order, the beginning two thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, inside the host cell, are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum into polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), respectively.40 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp): nsp1-11, from pp1a; and nsp12-16, from pp1ab. The proteolytic release of nsp1 occurs rapidly, which enables it to interfere with translation processes of the host cell by inducing cellular mRNA degradation.41\u201343 Nsp2-16 contain the viruses\u2019 replication and transcription complex and encode multiple enzymes with many functions, including proteases, helicase, polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease, N7-methyltransferase and 2\u2019O-methyltransferase, and de-ubiquitination enzymes.44 45 The final third of human coronavirus genomes contain genes that encode structural and accessory proteins. The four major structural proteins encoded here are the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike glycoprotein (S) proteins.46 47 The N protein is associated with the viral RNA genome, is involved in RNA synthesis regulation, and interacts with the M protein during viral budding.39 48 The M protein is important for viral assembly, it contains a short N-terminal domain that projects onto the external surface of the envelope and a long internal C-terminal.39 The E protein function is largely unknown; however, along with the N and M proteins, it is required for viral assembly and release.47 Lastly, the S protein gives coronaviruses their characteristic spikes that compose their crownlike appearance. This protein projects through the viral envelope, is heavily glycosylated, and regulates host cell membrane receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.49 The functions of the 11 accessory proteins encoded within the one-third closest to the 3\u2019 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not fully understood. These accessory proteins are encoded by the ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORC9c, and ORF10 genes. Some of these proteins, including ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, are interferon antagonists that impair the host cell immune response,50\u201353 whereas ORF3a might promote virus release54 and is involved in apoptosis of host cells through caspase-3 activation.55 ORF9b and ORF9c are known to suppress the host antiviral response by interacting with host cell organelles,56\u201358 whereas a clear understanding of the functions of ORF3c, ORF7b, and ORF10 remains unclear.59 Figure 1 (A,B) depicts the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genome and spike (S) protein amino acid composition. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30 000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of open reading frames (ORF) and elements that are essential for the virus\u2019 structure. The S protein is responsible for binding and entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain various S protein non-synonymous mutations that result in amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain (orange bracketed text) and the S1\/S2 subunit interface (black bracketed text), which have been shown to enhance transmissibility of the virus. Variants of concern include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and omicron (O). (B) SARS-CoV-2 structure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has a crown-like appearance and contains four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M). (C) Viral S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with human ACE2 receptors in order to gain entry into host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein tightly binds to ACE2. (D) S protein structure. The S protein protrudes out from the main SARS-CoV-2 bulk and is comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 contains the RBD, which directly interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, while the S1\/S2 interface contains a furin cleavage site that is cleaved to allow S2 to fuse with the host cell membrane. Both the RBD and the S1\/S2 interface contain transmissibility increasing mutations that are harboured in variants of concern The S glycoprotein is composed of two functionally distinct subunits (S1 and S2) and is essential for viral entry into host cells. The N-terminal S1 domain of the protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cell, which is the primary receptor that SARS-Cov-2 uses for cell entry.60 The C-terminal S2 domain fuses the host and viral membranes to allow for entry of the viral genome into the host cell.61 The subunits of the trimeric S complex are either in a closed (pre-fusion stage) or open (post-fusion stage) conformation,62 with one subunit always in an open conformation to allow for ACE2 recognition and binding.63 The RBD itself consists of five anti-parallel \u03b2 strands surrounded by several \u03b1 helices.64 From closed to open conformation, the RBD undergoes structural rearrangement whereby the globular head region rotates clockwise, which alters is elecropotential surface.64 Once positioned, numerous residues within the RBD form either hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with residues of the ACE2 receptor, allowing for tight binding,65 while the concave structure of the RBD allows for three distinct binding regions.64 Following binding between the S protein and the host cell receptor, host cell proteases cleave the S protein, causing the release of the S2 domain which allows for fusion and cell entry.66 Figure 1 (C,D) shows the structure and function of the S protein. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous cell types throughout the human body, including in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosas, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain,67 highlighting the widespread infection that SARS-CoV-2 can inflict. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2, a host cell protease, facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes,68 and could have a role in the spread of the virus in the airways.68 Host cell cathepsin L might also aid in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the S protein.69 Indeed, a clinically approved protease inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.70 Figure 2 depicts the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into and replicates inside host cells, and summarises the host cell immune response. Figure 2 Viral entry and host response. (A) At the alveolar epithelial cell layer. Epithelial cells in the lungs express both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing for infection by SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the virus within these cells induces an intense immune response that attracts monocytes, T cells, and macrophages and, in some instances, can result in a cytokine storm. (B) Within nearby blood vessels. Cytokines produced by the epithelial cell layer are released into blood vessels supplying the infected tissue, which causes the recruitment of further immune cells to the area, driving the damaging inflammatory response further. Circulating cytokines also create a systemic inflammatory environment. (C) Adaptive immune response. Circulating lymphocytes carry viral antigens to lymph nodes and bone marrow to begin the adaptive immune system processes whereby B cells, and later antibodies, are activated. (D) SARS-CoV2 host replication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into human cells. Following release of the viral RNA within the host cell, the virus uses the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to produce and manufacture new viral particles, which are released out of the cell to infect other cells and new hosts Emerging treatments As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19.309 Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK,310 311 US,312 313 and Europe314 315 for treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK,316 US,317 and Europe.318 These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below. Guidelines The treatment and management of covid-19 is a continually evolving topic; however, health authorities have published and continue to update guidelines and recommendations for treating covid-19. The WHO living guideline on covid-19 and treatment is regularly updated, with the latest version (published on 14 January 2022) containing 14 recommendations on covid-19 treatment.319 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence320 and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency321 provide updated guidelines on covid-19 treatment, and in Europe, the ECDC regularly publishes several guidelines providing recommendations on a range of covid-19 related topics.322 The US National Institutes of Health323 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention324 provide guidance on covid-19 treatment and management, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplying guidelines for specific groups such as employers, schools, health departments, and governments. Considerations for the future Novel infectious diseases and pandemics are an unpredictable but inevitable aspect of nature; therefore, we should learn from past pandemics to prepare for future ones. Firstly, the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and amplified the existing inequalities within society,325 with Black ethnicity, social disadvantage, and unemployment being risk factors for covid-19 infection326 and those groups most economically deprived found to be particularly vulnerable.327 These inequalities need resolving in order for us to be better prepared for similar situations in the future. Next, to progress through a pandemic we should be racing against the pathogen, and not against each other. This statement becomes apparent when considering the problems faced by countries seeking out personal protective equipment,328 and the vaccine inequity seen worldwide,329 with developed countries often better placed to be able to purchase these items. Initiatives such as WHO\u2019s COVAX programme are vital to protect the most vulnerable groups and reduce the global spread of disease. In October 2021, the UK government released a publication outlining where the policies implemented to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic failed, and the lessons learnt from these failures.330 The publication then presents conclusions and recommendations on how to enhance pandemic preparedness, lockdown and social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, social care, and vaccines. In countries such as the UK, US, and much of Europe, where the covid-19 death rate has been high, steps need to be taken and lessons need to be learnt in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. The responsibility of improving pandemic response lies with policy makers, the medical\/scientific community, and the public, and will ultimately require a collaborative approach. However, certain aspects of the response to the covid-19 pandemic have been a triumph. One major victory was the rapid development and rollout of vaccines,331 which continue to be effective. The rollout of rapid testing and quarantine for infected individuals was also important to at least disrupt the spread of the virus, especially given that asymptomatic individuals can contribute to the spread. Furthermore, the swift identification and sharing of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants between countries should be applauded. Lessons can be learnt from countries where covid-19 was controlled. In Taiwan, authorities managing the pandemic as directed by pre-covid-19 pandemic plans prompted an immediate response. Screening of all airline passengers arriving from Wuhan and high risk areas, restricting entry for non-Taiwanese citizens, 14 day quarantine periods for contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 or returning travellers, a ban on large gatherings, and widespread mask wearing were some of the quickly implemented management strategies.332 New Zealand implemented similarly effective restrictions, with the addition of a national lockdown.332 Many of the pandemic control components that kept infection and death numbers low in Taiwan and New Zealand could be adopted by other countries in the future and could lead to improved outcomes in terms of protecting the health of individuals and the health and wellbeing of the country. Overall, much can be learnt from the covid-19 pandemic and, as we emerge from it, the inspection of which policies failed and which succeeded is imperative. Conclusion Covid-19 remains prevalent and life threatening. Although the rollout of vaccines has been successful, attaining a high global vaccination coverage and ensuring that all healthcare systems have the capacity to cope with seasonal waves are essential. With the omicron variant highly prevalent, we must continue to learn, develop therapeutics, and remain vigilant to new variants of concern. Here, we have provided an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, including the mutations harboured by variants of the virus and how these mutations effect its transmissibility and virulence. We have also discussed the vaccines that have been developed and used around the world and have provided evidence supporting the rollout of booster doses. Future priorities should focus on continuing vaccination programmes and developing variant specific vaccines as new mutations emerge. This strategy, along with the expansion of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and which treatments are most successful to treat covid-19 infections will ultimately lead to favourable outcomes. Questions for future research How will the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutate in the future, and which mutations will give a competitive advantage that will allow the virus to inflict disease to many people? How do we keep up with the rapidly changing SARS-CoV-2 environment and ensure that vaccines remain effective? How do we manage the booster programme and when will future booster vaccinations be required in order to maintain high levels of immunity? How can we learn from the current and past pandemics so that we are better prepared for the next one?

        "text":"Elisabeth Mahase The BMJ Moderna\u2019s bivalent covid-19 vaccine\u2014which targets both the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and the omicron BA.1 variant\u2014will be rolled out alongside the original Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax covid-19 vaccines, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has said. NHS England has yet to confirm how and when eligible people will be able to access the booster vaccine, but the UK Health Security Agency has said that it will be offered to those at higher risk of severe illness. Vaccines being rolled out in the autumn booster programme The JCVI has advised that adults aged 18 and over should be offered a single dose of one of the following: Moderna mRNA bivalent omicron BA.1\/original \u201cwild-type\u201d vaccine Moderna mRNA original \u201cwild-type\u201d vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty) original \u201cwild-type\u201d vaccine Novavax Matrix-M adjuvanted wild-type vaccine (Nuvaxovid)\u2014which may be used when no alternative clinically suitable UK approved covid-19 vaccine is available For people aged 12 to 17: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty) original \u201cwild-type\u201d vaccine For children aged 5 to 11 years: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty) original \u201cwild-type\u201d vaccine paediatric formulation The announcement on 15 August came the same day that the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), approved Moderna\u2019s bivalent vaccine for use in adults. The vaccine has been given conditional marketing authorisation for adult booster doses in Great Britain, while emergency use authorisation has been granted in Northern Ireland. Half of each bivalent booster dose (25 micrograms) is made up of Moderna\u2019s original covid-19 vaccine, while the other half (25 micrograms) is made up of the updated version. Evidence base The MHRA said that its approval was based on study data showing that the bivalent vaccine triggered a \u201cstrong immune response\u201d against both BA.1 and the original virus, as well as a \u201cgood immune response\u201d against BA.4 and BA.5. A preprint published in June reported that, as part of the ongoing phase 2\/3 open label study, 437 participants (who had previously had three doses of the original Moderna vaccine) received a booster dose of the bivalent omicron vaccine, while 377 received a second booster dose of the original vaccine.1 These data appear to be the same as those included in the summary of product characteristics for the vaccine, which was highlighted by the MHRA when The BMJ requested the evidence underlying its approval.2 In participants with no history of covid-19, the estimated neutralising antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) against the original virus\u2014after adjusting for age groups and pre-booster titres\u2014were 6422.3 (95% confidence interval 5990.1 to 6885.7) 28 days after the bivalent vaccine and 5286.6 (4887.1 to 5718.9) after the original Moderna vaccine. Meanwhile, the estimated GMTs against BA.1 were 2479.9 (2264.5 to 2715.8) 28 days after the bivalent booster and 1421.2 (1283.0 to 1574.4) after the original vaccine booster. The bivalent vaccine \u201celicited a superior neutralising antibody response against omicron\u201d when compared with the original vaccine, and it showed a \u201cnon-inferior neutralising antibody response\u201d against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, the preprint said. The researchers also assessed the neutralising antibody response 28 days after the bivalent vaccine against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Looking at all participants regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMTs were 172.7 (147.5 to 202.3) before the booster and rose to 940.6 (826.3 to 1070.6) after it, with a fold rise of 5.4 (5.0 to 5.9), the preprint reported. Safety and reactogenicity profiles were reported as being similar and well tolerated in both the bivalent group and the original vaccine group. Emerging variants Commenting on the approval, Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said, \u201cThe early data certainly suggests that the new Moderna vaccine, targeting two different flavours of SARS-2 coronavirus spike protein, works better against the newly emerged omicron variants. \u201cThese variants have been the most able to escape the antibodies raised through infection or vaccination by previous variants. This should provide people with better protection against the omicron variants.\u201d However, Ball, who himself receives funding to develop next generation covid-19 vaccines, added that the virus was \u201cunlikely to stand still, and omicron targeted immunity might push the virus down other evolutionary paths.\u201d \u201cThat said, unless there is a major shift in the virus, immunity will continue to protect the vast majority from serious disease caused by emerging variants.\u201d Beate Kampmann, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that the availability of a bivalent vaccine was \u201cgood news\u201d but added, \u201cThe bivalent vaccines have not yet been widely tested in large heterogeneous population groups. \u201cIn essence, I think it is wise not to recommend a \u2018personalised vaccination approach\u2019 but to go with the wider entirely pragmatic public health message that boosters are an important intervention for the winter period and should be taken up across age groups, as recommended, with the most vulnerable to be first in line.\u201d This article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "title":"Waning effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/378\/bmj-2022-071249",
        "text":"Results 1 951 866 and 3 219 349 eligible adults received two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, and 2 422 980 remained unvaccinated. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be similar across outcomes and vaccine brands. In the \u226565 years subgroup, ratios of adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.24) to 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) per four weeks. Despite waning vaccine effectiveness, rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death were substantially lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated adults up to 26 weeks after the second dose, with estimated vaccine effectiveness \u226580% for BNT162b2, and \u226575% for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in vaccinated people were similar to or higher than in unvaccinated people (adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) for BNT162b2 and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) for ChAdOx1). We did a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY-TPP database ( https:\/\/opensafely.org ), which includes detailed linked data on 24 million people (approximately 44% of the English population) registered with an English general practice using The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) SystmOne electronic health record software. We compared rates of covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related and non-covid-19 related mortality, and infection with SARS-CoV-2, between adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) vaccine and those who were unvaccinated. Examination of waning of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness is difficult. The success of vaccine rollouts in many countries means that only a small and selected proportion of the population remains unvaccinated and uninfected. Continuing uptake of vaccination, as well as ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2, further depletes this group over time. Vaccines were offered in priority order determined by age and clinical vulnerability, so that the longest follow-up is in people at the highest risk of severe covid-19. Rapid changes in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, related to pandemic control measures and introduction of new variants, make accounting for the calendar date on which events occurred essential. Many studies of waning covid-19 vaccine effectiveness have used \u201ctest negative case-control\u201d designs, restricted to people tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and comparing those testing positive (cases) and negative (controls) 5 9 17 18 or reported indirect evidence such as changing rates of covid-19 with time since vaccination. 11 12 The extent to which test negative case-control designs control bias due to confounding, or are biased because of the restriction to people who were tested, remains unclear. 19 20 The effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines, first shown in randomised trials, 1 2 has been confirmed with longer follow-up in observational studies. 3 4 5 However, neutralising antibody titres decrease with time since vaccination, 6 7 8 and vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time. 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The extent of waning of vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 is less clear: studies have found no evidence of waning, 9 10 17 modest waning, 5 11 or substantial waning. 12 Clarification of rates of waning effectiveness is needed to determine the frequency with which booster doses are needed and whether booster vaccination should be targeted at groups defined by age, clinical vulnerability, or brand of primary vaccine. Public contributors were not involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No public contributors were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Covid-19 vaccination is offered to the whole population, including the researchers involved in the study. The main barriers to involving external public contributors were the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, which means that evidence quickly becomes outdated, and the urgent need to conduct and disseminate the research. OpenSAFELY invites any patient or member of the public to make contact with the project via https:\/\/opensafely.org\/ . We did all analyses independently in four vaccine priority subgroups: aged \u226565 years and in JCVI groups 2-5, aged 18-64 years and clinically vulnerable (JCVI groups 4 or 6), aged 40-64 years (JCVI groups 7-10; most people in this subgroup received ChAdOx1), and aged 18-39 years (JCVI groups 11-12; this subgroup received only BNT162b2). The \u226565 subgroup included participants who were clinically vulnerable, whereas the 40-64 and 18-39 subgroups did not. We fitted additional models separately in men and women to investigate effect modification by sex and in 65-74 and \u226575 years subgroups to investigate effect modification by age in older adults. We used meta-regression to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of hazard ratios per comparison period. The ratios of hazard ratios can be interpreted as follows: if the hazard ratio in the three to six week comparison period is 0.5 and the ratio of hazard ratios is 1.2, then the hazard ratios will be 0.6 (=0.5\u00d71.2), 0.72 (=0.5\u00d71.2 2 ), 0.86 (=0.5\u00d71.2 3 ), 1.04 (=0.5\u00d71.2 4 ), and 1.24 (0.5\u00d71.2 5 ) in the 7-10, 11-14, 15-18, 19-22, and 23-26 week comparison periods respectively. To estimate hazard ratios, we fitted Cox regression models with baseline hazards stratified by JCVI group, eligibility date, and region used to define the second vaccination periods, and with the covariates described above. To avoid problems with model convergence, we excluded binary covariates from the model if any cell of the table defined by cross tabulating the covariate with vaccine group and comparison period contained fewer than three events. For categorical covariates with more than two levels, levels were merged until either all levels had more than three events or only one level existed, in which case the variable was excluded. We carried out this process independently for each outcome. We modelled age within strata as linear, with quadratic terms additionally included for strata with age range >5 years. For each comparison period, we estimated hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients versus unvaccinated people, ChAdOx1 recipients versus unvaccinated people, and BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 recipients. We did not estimate hazard ratios for comparison periods with fewer than three events in either group. For each person, follow-up ended at the earliest of the outcome of interest, deregistration from the primary care practice, death, or 15 December 2021. However, for SARS-CoV-2 test, follow-up ended at the \u201coutcome of interest\u201d only when the test result was positive. Fully vaccinated people who received a booster dose, and unvaccinated people who received a first dose were excluded from subsequent comparison periods, but follow-up within comparison periods was not censored after these events. Models were adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, sex (male or female), English Index of Multiple Deprivation (grouped by fifths), ethnicity (black, mixed, South Asian, white, other, as per the UK census), body mass index, learning disability, serious mental illness, number of comorbid conditions in different organ systems (supplementary table S3), current pregnancy, number of SARS-CoV-2 tests between 18 May 2020 (when widespread testing became available) and eligibility for first vaccine dose, and receipt of one or more flu vaccines in the five years before the start of the second vaccination period. The outcomes were covid-19 related hospital admission (identified using Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient hospital records), covid-19 related death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-covid-19 related death. We also investigated test seeking behaviour by comparing rates of testing for SARS-CoV-2 between the vaccine groups. Covid-19 and non-covid-19 related deaths (death certificates with and without a covid-19 code) were based on death registry data from the Office for National Statistics. We identified SARS-CoV-2 tests by using SGSS records, on the basis of swab date. Both polymerase chain reaction and lateral flow tests were included, without differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We defined all outcomes by the date of their first occurrence during the comparison follow-up period. Where no positive SARS-CoV-2 test was present, but a record of covid-19 related hospital admission and\/or death was recorded, we imputed the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test as the date of covid-19 related hospital admission or death. We followed up unvaccinated people for the full eight calendar weeks that spanned the comparison periods for vaccinated people. To avoid overlap in follow-up of unvaccinated people between comparison periods (see lines corresponding to unvaccinated individuals E-L in figure 1 ), follow-up time for unvaccinated people was assigned at random to start either two or six weeks after the start of the second vaccination period and was split into the three consecutive eight week calendar periods during which vaccinated people were followed in each comparison period. Unvaccinated people assigned to start at two weeks were followed during comparison periods 1, 3, and 5, and those assigned to start at six weeks were followed during comparison periods 2, 4, and 6. Illustrative example showing definition of four week comparison periods, within strata defined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation group, eligibility date, and region. Horizontal lines represent follow-up time for four vaccinated and eight unvaccinated people, and colours of lines correspond to six comparison periods. Individuals A and D received their second vaccinations on first and last day of second vaccination period (SVP), respectively Figure 1 depicts the study design. The analysis timescale was calendar time, which ensured that vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared on the calendar day on which each outcome event occurred. We split follow-up time for fully vaccinated people into six consecutive four week \u201ccomparison periods,\u201d starting two weeks after receipt of the second dose. Because each second vaccination period was four weeks long and each vaccinated person was followed up for four weeks per comparison period, vaccinated people were followed during eight calendar weeks in each comparison period. Vaccinated people entered and finished follow-up on the calendar dates corresponding to the start and end of their comparison period. We defined the second vaccination period as the four week period during which the greatest number of people in the stratum received their second dose. We excluded people from the vaccine groups if they received their first dose before their eligibility date, had an interval between first and second dose of less than six or more than 14 weeks, or were flagged as a healthcare worker on their vaccination record. We assigned people to the unvaccinated group if they had received no covid-19 vaccine at the start of the second vaccination period for their analysis stratum. We excluded people from any group if they had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by the start of their second vaccination period (either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in SGSS or probable covid-19 coded in primary care records), had ever been recorded as being resident in a care home, or had evidence of having started an end-of-life care pathway. We defined three groups who received two doses of BNT162b2, received two doses of ChAdOx1, or were unvaccinated. Eligibility for the vaccinated groups was restricted to people who received their second vaccine dose during a four week \u201csecond vaccination period\u201d within analysis strata defined by UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority groups (supplementary table S1), eligibility date (for priority groups within which eligibility was based on age; supplementary table S2), and English NHS region (defined using individuals\u2019 primary care practice address). This study was approved by NHS England. People were eligible for inclusion if they were aged \u226518 years on 1 July 2021 and had been registered with a primary care doctor for at least one year before eligibility for their first vaccine dose (the \u201celigibility date,\u201d supplementary table S2). People were excluded if they were aged >120 years on the date at which they became eligible for vaccination; their sex, geographical region, ethnicity, or English Index of Multiple Deprivation were unknown; or they were resident in a care home or medically housebound at six weeks after their eligibility date. Full details are in supplementary figure S1. We observed no consistent differences between vaccine effectiveness in men and women. For ChAdOx1, adjusted hazard ratios seemed to be broadly similar in men and women. For BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 related hospital admission seemed to be somewhat greater in women than in men in the \u226565 subgroup but greater in men than in women in the 18-39 subgroup (supplementary tables S51-58; supplementary figures S32-35). Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 recipients consistently favoured BNT162b2 ( fig 3 ; supplementary table S7; ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in supplementary table S8). In the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios were 0.51 (0.33 to 0.79) and 0.36 (0.23 to 0.55), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission during weeks seven to 10; 0.58 (0.36 to 0.94) and 0.49 (0.20 to 1.18), respectively, for covid-19 related death during weeks 15-18; and 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88) and 0.35 (0.29 to 0.41), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks three to six. Because the rate of waning was slightly higher for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, the adjusted hazard ratios for both the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups were attenuated by weeks 23-26, but they still favoured BNT162b2 over ChAdOx1 (0.69 (0.61 to 0.78) and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.57), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission; 0.65 (0.48 to 0.86) and 0.54 (0.28 to 1.05), respectively, for covid-19 related death; and 0.75 (0.72 to 0.78) and 0.70 (0.67 to 0.72), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test). We observed 1 406 181, 2 907 849, and 674 534 SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (only the first test in each comparison period counted; supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, rates of testing during weeks three to six were higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61) to 2.09 (2.03 to 2.15) for BNT162b2 and from 2.01 (1.95 to 2.08) to 2.79 (2.75 to 2.83) for ChAdOx1 (supplementary figure S30; supplementary tables S7 and S8). The discrepancy in testing behaviour between the vaccinated and unvaccinated people increased slightly by weeks 23-26; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 2.06 (2.00 to 2.13) to 3.06 (2.66 to 3.53) for BNT162b2 and from 2.31 (2.27 to 2.36) to 3.70 (3.64 to 3.76) for ChAdOx1. We observed 8463, 9135, and 3031 non-covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios during weeks three to six ranged from 0.29 (0.24 to 0.35) to 0.47 (0.34 to 0.64) for BNT162b2 and from 0.29 (0.20 to 0.44) to 0.36 (0.30 to 0.44) for ChAdOx1 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). By weeks 23-26, these ranged from 0.55 (0.40 to 0.76) to 0.58 (0.48 to 0.69) for BNT162b2 and from 0.64 (0.43 to 0.95) to 0.74 (0.61 to 0.90) for ChAdOx1. Rates of waning were lower than for the other outcomes (maximum ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.19 (1.09 to 1.31); supplementary table S8). We observed 62 363, 186 137, and 118 216 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). For BNT162b2 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios across subgroups ranged from 0.19 (0.13 to 0.27) to 0.27 (0.23 to 0.31) during weeks three to six and from 0.87 (0.78-0.97) to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). For ChAdOx1 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios ranged across subgroups from 0.43 (0.32 to 0.58) to 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81) and waned to 1.23 (1.11 to 1.36), 1.35 (1.29 to 1.41), and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively. For BNT162b2, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.29 (1.23 to 1.35), 1.30 (1.23 to 1.36), 1.32 (1.17 to 1.49), and 1.54 (1.50 to 1.59) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups, respectively (supplementary table S8). For ChAdOx1, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24), 1.14 (1.11 to 1.17), and 1.20 (1.16 to 1.25) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively. We observed 329, 595, and 889 covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). In the \u226565 subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks three to six after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.12 (0.08 to 0.17) and 0.15 (0.11 to 0.21) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.31 (1.07 to 1.61) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. In the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks 15-18 after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.16) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.08 (0.04 to 0.18) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.20) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.38 (0.77 to 2.47) and 1.21 (0.99 to 1.49) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks 11-14 to 0.10 (0.04 to 0.22) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.66 (1.08 to 2.55) per period). Too few covid-19 related deaths occurred in the 18-39 subgroup to allow estimation of hazard ratios. We observed 2100, 5369, and 9443 covid-19 related hospital admissions in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the \u226565 subgroup were 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.13) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.23), respectively, during weeks three to six after the second dose, waning to 0.20 (0.17 to 0.25) and 0.25 (0.21 to 0.29), respectively, during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were similar for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1: 1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40), respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.12) and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.14), respectively, during weeks three to six, waning to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.12) and 0.23 (0.19 to 0.26), respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35) and 1.20 (1.14 to 1.27) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.12 (0.10 to 0.15) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.24 (1.16 to 1.33) per period). Adjusted hazard ratios for BNT162b2 could not be estimated in the 40-64 subgroup because too few covid-19 related hospital admissions occurred. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-39 subgroup waned from 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.18 (0.10 to 0.29) during weeks 19-22 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.31 (1.10 to 1.57) per period). Figure 2 shows adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccination versus no vaccination across the six comparison periods. The slopes of the lines correspond to ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per comparison period (also shown in supplementary table S8). The missing adjusted hazard ratios could not be estimated because too few events occurred in one or both groups (supplementary table S5). Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios are shown in supplementary tables S6 and S7, respectively, and compared in supplementary figures S24-29, with adjusted hazard ratios for each covariate shown in supplementary tables S9-50. For the models comparing people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated people, the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were generally similar. Where they differed, patterns were outcome and subgroup specific. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were similar for comparisons of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1. Supplementary figures S20-23 show the distribution of follow-up by calendar time in each comparison period, for each subgroup, relative to dates during which different variants were dominant. Follow-up in the \u226565 subgroup began on 15 March 2021 (when the alpha variant was dominant) and ended on 30 November 2021. Follow-up for the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups began on 21 April, 18 May, and 23 July 2021, respectively: the delta variant was dominant in England by 1 June 2021. The latest follow-up was on 15 December 2021; 54% of specimens sampled in England on this date had S-gene target failure, which suggests that the omicron variant became dominant in England by this date. 24 The cumulative incidence of first vaccine dose by week 23 in previously unvaccinated people was 16%, 28%, 13%, and 14% in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups respectively (supplementary figure S19). The UK vaccination programme initially offered third doses only after six months (23-26 weeks) since the second dose 21 ; however, among the 18-39 subgroup, 35% and 26% of those in the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups, respectively, had received a third dose by week 20, because the required time since second dose was reduced to three months in early December 2021 owing to concerns about the omicron variant. 22 23 Of 13 841 107 people satisfying initial eligibility criteria (supplementary figure S2), 5 222 812 received second doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 during the second vaccination period for their stratum (supplementary figures S3-18) and 2 575 111 were unvaccinated at the start of their second vaccination period. Of these, 1 951 866, 3 219 349, and 2 422 980 were eligible for inclusion in the first comparison period for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and unvaccinated groups, respectively. Table 1 and supplementary table S4 show summary statistics for these three groups by subgroup. Compared with vaccinated people, unvaccinated people were less likely to be white, to live in a more affluent area, to have had a flu vaccine in the previous five years, or to have tested for SARS-CoV-2 before their eligibility date. The distribution of other characteristics between vaccine groups differed according to subgroup. For example, in the \u226565 subgroup, those vaccinated with BNT162b2 were older than those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (75 (interquartile range 72-80) years) versus 72 (70-75) years, whereas the converse was true in the 40-64 subgroup (44 (41-50) years versus 55 (50-59) years). Discussion This cohort study estimated the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccines during six consecutive periods, each of four weeks\u2019 duration, starting two weeks after receipt of second dose. Rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death were consistently and substantially lower among fully vaccinated people compared with those who remained unvaccinated, up to 26 weeks after the second vaccination, and consistently lower among people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 than with ChAdOx1. However, by 23-26 weeks, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test (ascertained through freely available national routine testing) in fully vaccinated people were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated people. Rates of non-covid-19 related death were consistently lower among fully vaccinated than unvaccinated people. When quantified as ratios of adjusted hazard ratios, estimated waning of vaccine effectiveness was strikingly similar across risk groups, except that waning was fastest in the 18-39 year subgroup (those at lowest risk of severe covid-19, all vaccinated with BNT162b2). In those subgroups in which the two vaccines could be compared, estimated vaccine effectiveness was consistently greater for BNT162b2 than for ChAdOx1, but waning was somewhat faster for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, so that the two brands\u2019 comparative effectiveness became more similar over time. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death remained \u22640.20 (\u226580% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2 and \u22640.25 (\u226575% vaccine effectiveness) for ChAdOx1 during weeks 23-26 after the second vaccination. Findings in context A systematic review and meta-regression of the duration of effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines included 18 studies, most of which evaluated BNT162b2 or Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 vaccine.13 Estimates of vaccine effectiveness and the duration of vaccine effectiveness varied substantially between studies. Only two studies found minimal vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection by six months, and none found decreases in vaccine effectiveness against positive SARS-CoV-2 test as large as those reported in our study.914 The meta-regression estimated an average decrease in vaccine effectiveness from one to six months after full vaccination across studies of 9.5 (95% confidence interval 5.7 to 14.6) percentage points for severe covid-19 (hospital admission or death due to covid-19), and of 20.7 (10.2 to 36.6) percentage points for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The corresponding reductions in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were: covid-19 related hospital admission 12.8 (7.41 to 18.2) for BNT162b2 and 11.7 (3.44 to 20.0) for ChAdOx1; positive SARS-CoV-2 test 68.2 (56.4 to 80.0) for BNT162b2 and 79.6 (62.0 to 97.2) for ChAdOx1. However, the ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were similar for covid-19 related hospital admission (1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) for BNT162b2 and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40) for ChAdOx1) and for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1.29 (1.23 to 1.35) for BNT162b2 and 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24) for ChAdOx1). Thus, the metric used to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness can lead to strikingly different conclusions about its magnitude. The review concluded that the decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 was less than for SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease. However, by quantifying waning in terms of ratios of hazard ratios, we found that rates of waning were similar for these two outcomes (supplementary table S8). As in our study, Andrews and colleagues analysed NHS England electronic health records data to investigate the duration of protection by covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic and severe covid-19.5 They used a test negative case-control design, which aims to reduce confounding due to health seeking behaviour by considering only people who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.25 However, this restriction to the subpopulation of people who are tested if they have symptoms has potential biases. For example, if older people were more likely to seek testing when they had symptoms then vaccine effectiveness in the tested subpopulation may differ from that in the general population.20 The restriction to those tested can also induce so-called \u201ccollider bias,\u201d because associations between causes of being tested are distorted in the tested subpopulation.26 Comparisons between this study and that of Andrews and colleagues are restricted to the \u226565 and 40-64 subgroups, as these are identically defined in the two studies, and to the 15-18 weeks comparison period in this study and the 15-19 weeks since second dose in the other study, which were the most similar across the two studies. Compared with Andrews and colleagues, we consistently estimated lower effectiveness for both vaccines against covid-19 related hospital admission (differences ranged from 1.3 to 6.4 percentage points). Andrews and colleagues concluded (by contrast with our study) that waning was greater for ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 and greater among older adults and those in a clinical risk group. Whereas those authors found continuing vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 up to 26 weeks after receipt of the second vaccine dose, we found rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to be similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated participants by that time. Most of the follow-up in our study was while the delta variant was dominant in England. Previous studies found vaccine effectiveness to be lower for the delta variant than the alpha variant,31827 and lower for the omicron variant than the delta variant.2829 Consistent with the findings of this study, infection in vaccinated people has been widespread since the omicron variant became dominant; an estimated 71% of people in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 22 April 2022.30 It will be important to extend the analyses reported in this study to examine longer term effectiveness of two dose vaccination, and waning effectiveness of booster vaccination, against the omicron variant. Strengths and limitations of this study Our study is based on whole population data analysed within the OpenSAFELY Trusted Research Environment, which has stringent disclosure controls to protect patients\u2019 privacy. The large study size and large numbers of outcome events led to precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness according to brand of vaccine and time since second vaccine dose. We accounted for risk dependent vaccine allocation by separating the cohort into subgroups based on JCVI group,31 and by doing analyses within strata defined by JCVI group, eligibility date for primary vaccination, and geographical region. We fully accounted for rapid changes in incidence of covid-19 with calendar time, because the risk sets underpinning the Cox models compared people being followed on the calendar day when outcome events occurred. Our analyses also excluded people with a pre-vaccine rollout record of SARS-CoV-2 infection and accounted for censoring due to occurrence of outcome events and attenuation of comparison groups because of receipt of first vaccine dose by unvaccinated people and third dose by fully vaccinated people. The OpenSAFELY platform contains an unprecedented scale of NHS records that are refreshed every week, and the methods used for data storage and management facilitate rapid re-execution of all curation and analysis code. This will enable us to regularly reassess waning vaccine effectiveness over extended time intervals, the impact of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the effects of further doses of covid-19 vaccines. Our study has several limitations. Firstly, as in any observational study, our estimates could be affected by confounding by unmeasured factors. The detailed linked data analysed permitted adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, but we may not have been able to control completely for the associations of being vaccinated with health seeking behaviours and being less socioeconomically deprived. Secondly, patients registered with a primary care practice who have moved or emigrated (or whose death was not recorded)32 may contribute person time but not events. Because the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups are defined by recent vaccination, these \u201cghost\u201d patients are more likely to be present in the unvaccinated group, leading to bias in estimates of waning. Also, healthcare workers could be identified and excluded from the vaccinated groups, because this information was recorded at the time of vaccination, but not from the unvaccinated group. This limitation should not affect results for the \u226565 subgroup, most of whom are retired, or comparisons between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. Thirdly, consistent with an Australian survey,33 we found that unvaccinated people had tested less frequently than vaccinated people during the pre-vaccine rollout period when widespread testing was available (table 1) and were considerably less likely to be tested during follow-up (supplementary table S7). Fourthly, differential depletion of susceptible people in the unvaccinated groups over time may lead to attenuation of hazard ratios even when true vaccine effectiveness does not change. However, such bias is likely to be minimal when vaccine effectiveness is high.34 Fifthly, we excluded people vaccinated outside defined \u201csecond vaccination periods\u201d and estimated hazard ratios within four week periods subsequent to second vaccination. Modelling non-linear interactions of vaccine effectiveness with time since vaccination is a potentially more powerful approach that could avoid excluding so many people but would rely on more complex modelling assumptions than those underpinning our analyses.",

        "text":"We used data from a large cohort of people with covid-19 infection that occurred in December 2021 to examine the relative difference in covid-19 mortality between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants. Our study shows that the risk of covid-19 death was reduced by 66% after infection with the omicron BA.1 variant compared with the delta variant after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status and comorbidities. Importantly, we found that the relative risk of covid-19 death after omicron infection versus delta infection varied by age, with lower relative risk in younger people. The risk also varied by vaccination status, with the difference in covid-19 death between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants being lower for all vaccination statuses but less pronounced for people who had received two vaccinations. Because the emergence of the omicron variant resulted in an increased rate of transmission, the number of people infected with the omicron variant in our sample increased considerably across the study period. To account for the difference in infection rate across the period, a cubic spline for calendar time was included in models 2-4. While the BA.2 subvariant of omicron does not have the spike gene deletion that causes SGTF, the UK only recorded an increase in the number of people with subvariant BA.2 in the week commencing 3 January 2022. 13 Our data include omicron compatible and delta compatible infections identified between 1 and 30 December 2021, which was a period when BA.1 was prominent and omicron could be identified from SGTF. These results provide clear evidence that in the UK the risk of covid-19 mortality after infection with omicron is considerably less than for delta. Our results extend these initial analyses quantifying the risk of omicron severity in terms of hospital admission to covid-19 mortality. Nyberg and colleagues 8 report a reduction in death after omicron infection (hazard ratio 0.31) compared with delta, which is similar to our findings. Importantly, our results account for more sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, and highlight that the reduction in risk remains consistent even after adjusting for these additional variables. Furthermore, our study specifically quantifies the risk of cause specific covid-19 mortality, using death registration data, unlike previous work which has defined covid-19 death as death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Early work exploring the clinical severity of the covid-19 omicron variant in a South African cohort found considerably reduced odds of hospital admission after SGTF versus non-SGTF infection across the same period. 7 A subsequent study in California on positive PCR tests between 30 November 2021 and 1 January 2022 also showed risk reductions for hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality after omicron infection compared with delta infection. 10 In Canada, in a matched sample, the risk of hospital admission or death was found to be 65% lower among those with the omicron variant than in people with the delta variant. 11 Emerging evidence has found that omicron replicates more readily in the upper airways than the lungs, potentially indicating a biological mechanism for the reduction in risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron compared with delta. 12 Strengths and limitations of this study We used a large sample of positive cases from the national testing programme, allowing us to estimate the relative risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron BA.1 and delta. By linking these infection data to information on vaccination status, comprehensive sociodemographic characteristics from the census and information on pre-existing conditions based on primary care and hospital data, we were able to estimate the relative difference in mortality between the omicron BA.1 and delta variants, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status with manufacturer type and key worker status. We also tested whether the relative mortality risk for omicron BA.1 versus delta depended on vaccination status and the number of comorbidities by including interactions between variant type and vaccination status (or comorbidities). This is an important result because we show that regardless of vaccination status omicron was milder than delta. However, no difference was found by number of comorbidities. To control for the prioritisation of the vaccination rollout, we adjusted for the interaction between vaccination status and age. We used death certificate data to confirm covid-19 mortality, which prevented people who died from other causes after a positive covid-19 test being included in our sample. Additionally, it is important to note that the number of covid-19 deaths was low in people younger than 70 years of age, with 68.1% of events occurring in those aged \u226570. However, we had sufficient power to show important risk reductions in younger age groups, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders. We also compared the outcomes during the same time periods to minimise bias from management of patients with covid-19 in healthcare settings during the pandemic. One study limitation is an ascertainment bias because the data do not cover all SARS-CoV-2 infections, but only a subset of people who tested positive as part of the national testing programme in the community and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Tests conducted in the community but processed by other laboratories and tests conducted in hospitals could not be used because they do not use the S gene molecular diagnostic assay, which we used to identify the variant type. A limitation of our work is not having access to data to determine covid-19 variants from tests in hospital (NHS pillar 1), which explains why our total sample is smaller than those used in other research.8 Differences in testing behaviours between groups could bias the estimates of risk of covid-19 death among people who tested positive. If some people only get tested if they experience severe symptoms, the estimated risk of death would be higher in this group than in people who get tested more routinely, even if the population has the same underlying risk. To mitigate this issue, we also adjusted the models for factors that might affect the propensity to get tested and might also be related to the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ethnicity, region, calendar date of infection, and key worker status. However, adjusting for these factors in models 3 and 4 had little effect on our overall estimates, suggesting that any selection effects according to these characteristics had smaller impacts than might be hypothesised. One explanation for this could be the restriction of our analysis to a short time period when both variants were circulating. Sociodemographic information was obtained from the 2011 census, which was the most up to date at the time of the study, however future validation work should be conducted when 2021 census data have been released and potentially using more breakdowns of variables, such as region. Because of death registration delays, not all deaths that occurred in the period might have been registered at the time of the study. Deaths that occurred among people who tested positive in late December are less likely to have been registered than those that occurred in people who tested positive at the beginning of the month. As the proportion of omicron BA.1 infections increased during December, the delay in death registration, if unaccounted for, could lead to underestimation of the severity of the omicron BA.1 variant. However, we accounted for the effect of registration delay in December by adjusting for calendar time of infection in our models, reducing the difference between omicron BA.1 compared with delta as expected. To fully assess the impact of covid-19, additional outcome measures such as hospital admission need to be considered. Furthermore, if the data allow, symptom profiles could be used to predict outcomes to enable better management of healthcare requirements.",

Subsequent analyses further supported a lower risk of severe outcomes in infections with omicron compared with delta, although these data were limited to all cause deaths within 28 days of diagnosis.4 Additionally, many public health measures previously enacted to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission were being relaxed in early 2022, potentially resulting in more infections in relatively low risk populations. These limitations complicated efforts to assess the true risk of severe disease and mortality associated with omicron infection. The linked retrospective cohort study by Ward and colleagues (doi:10.1136\/bmj-2022-070695) takes a further step towards addressing this question. The study reported new evidence that mortality rates were lower for infections with the omicron BA.1 subvariant than for the delta variant of concern, even after controlling for patient demographics, previous infection, and vaccination status. The study team used the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset to access census data, mortality records, vaccination dates, and other standardised measures for over one million UK adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2021 when omicron and delta were circulating. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction test results were mined for spike gene target failure, with specimens failing to amplify the S gene classified as BA.1 compatible. Although less reliable than whole genome sequencing, this technique can distinguish delta from BA.1 by detecting the deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike gene characteristic of BA.1 (present in almost 95% of BA.1 lineage sequences v 0.2% of delta).5 Death certification records definitively identified over 350 covid-19 related deaths in the cohort. Ultimately, the risk of covid-19 related death was found to be 66% lower in people infected with omicron than in those with delta, similar to the 69% lower risk reported by Nyberg and colleagues.4 This study provides the most conclusive evidence to date that infection with the omicron subvariant BA.1 was inherently less deadly than delta when controlling for a number of key covariates. Combining death certification records with molecular surveillance is the main advantage of this study, which avoids previous biases in covid-19 death designations. Accounting for a broad array of standardised covariates, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, and previous immunity, is another strength. Similar to previous reports, risk of covid-19 death with omicron decreased in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Although the reduction was more pronounced in unvaccinated and boosted populations relative to the double vaccinated, this is likely skewed by the very low mortality rate among vaccinated people and the fact that booster shots were prioritised for at-risk populations during the study period. The study also has some limitations that curtail its generalisability. Despite the strengths of the Public Health Data Asset, data collection is limited to adults in the UK and might not reflect observations in other countries or in children. A reliance on hospital system data likewise could skew cohort characteristics due to possible biases in the population captured by these data. Finally, as previously noted, the use of spike gene target failure as a proxy for variant identification carries some risk of misclassification. While consensus is forming that omicron infections are associated with lower mortality rates (including preliminary data on BA.4 and BA.5), several considerations remain. Firstly, it is still unclear why the risk of death is lower. Is this due to omicron\u2019s increased capacity to avoid immune recall67 leading to lower immune activation, altered viral tropism,89 changes in anatomical localisation,10 improvements in clinical care, or a combination of these and other factors? Understanding the causes is critical for assessing risks as variants continue to emerge. Secondly, a broader discussion on optimal strategies for communicating risk and implementing appropriate public health responses is necessary. Early reports suggesting lower mortality in people with omicron infections11 were widely broadcast with limited emphasis on the underlying uncertainty. While these early observations are ultimately being corroborated, effective communication will be essential for individual risk assessments and broader public health responses as the pandemic continues to evolve. Finally, it is essential to continue to develop, optimise, and deploy systems that integrate molecular surveillance, demographic, epidemiological, and clinical datasets to enable timely research. Investment in this infrastructure will be critical for the continued response to covid-19 and for future pandemic preparedness.

        "text":"David Oliver , consultant in geriatrics and acute general medicine Berkshire davidoliver372{at}googlemail.com Follow David on Twitter @mancunianmedic I recently used this platform to describe my personal experiences of working on covid wards through the pandemic, my own subsequent illness as a result of covid, and my decision to withdraw from the presidency of the Royal College of Physicians.1 In the seven years that I\u2019ve been writing this column, I\u2019ve never had anything like the reaction that this one provoked. It wasn\u2019t just the metrics on page views, downloads, or social media shares but also the volume of private direct messages, emails, and letters I received. I\u2019m still very sad about my withdrawal from a role I\u2019d worked hard to be elected to and was looking forward to. It\u2019s left a big hole in my plans for my late career. I\u2019m still not sure when I\u2019ll be declared fit enough to go back to my clinical work. And I\u2019m still worried that, when I do go back, those feelings of being overwhelmed and burnt out will still be there. The responses, however, offered me some powerful learning. Firstly, the act of my talking openly about my personal experience and vulnerability seemed to help and resonate with many other doctors and nurses. I imagine that I\u2019m not everyone\u2019s idea of \u201cvulnerable.\u201d I\u2019m a big, burly man in his late 50s with 33 years\u2019 experience in the job, with all kinds of senior leadership roles behind me, who worked right through two years of the covid pandemic without getting ill or taking time off. So, if I was writing about how exhausted I was, others felt more able to admit this too. I\u2019d made a deliberate decision to put my wellbeing and health first\u2014over and above career ambition or presenteeism\u2014and this seemed to resonate with readers. Secondly, when readers shared their own experiences of burnout, long covid, or other illnesses, including sickness and tragedy in their own families, it put my own problems into context. I had so little to worry about, compared with much of what other people shared with me. My correspondents have made it very clear that health, home, and family life are far more important than careerism, presenteeism, or ambition. Like other ambitious, workaholic medics who are defined by their professional life, I\u2019d clearly been getting things the wrong way round. Finally, the reactions made me feel good about the impact of writing this column for all of those years. At least I can now carry on writing, without worrying about whether my views are at odds with the official stance of any institution.

The term \u201clong covid\u201d was coined by patients, initially being used on social media to describe symptoms that were impairing quality of life.9 We argue that this experience generates an obligation to recognise long covid as a potentially disabling condition defined by clinical diagnostic criteria and supported by ongoing clinical research. Such recognition would also re-enforce the obligation of the state to extend and expand supportive infrastructure and policy for people with other disabilities. The need for just social policies grounded in contemporary theories of disability, designed by disabled people for disabled people, can also form the basis for advocacy and policy change beyond the pandemic. What is long covid? Although long covid is widely acknowledged to exist, diagnostic criteria vary, with different authorities acknowledging a diversity of symptoms and severity levels. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and impaired memory, and sensory changes like permanent loss of smell or taste.10 Physiologically, long covid may cause damage to extremities, in some cases requiring amputation1112; multiorgan injury such as chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis or transplant1314; or respiratory complications and persistent post-exertional symptoms. These symptoms may exist in isolation or in clusters, and though they range in severity, many greatly affect people\u2019s wellbeing and life plans. The exact prevalence of long covid is unknown because the wide range of presentations overlap numerous other conditions, there is no definitive diagnostic test, some people with long covid may struggle to access care (and thereby be counted), and covid-19 testing was difficult to access in many settings at the beginning of the pandemic. In the UK, the Coronavirus Infection Survey conducted from April 2020 to August 2021 estimated between 3% and 11% of 15 061 participants with covid-19 infection experienced symptoms for more than 12 weeks.15 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found up to 20% of 353 000 patients aged 18-64 years had one symptom attributable to covid-19 more than four weeks after infection.16 At its lower bound, at least 16.5 million of the 562 million people infected with covid-19 worldwide as of 20 July 202217 may have long covid, but at its higher estimates, the number could extend to over 100 million people. Symptoms of long covid can persist for over a year and potentially be permanent. One international online survey in 2020 of 3762 people in 56 countries with confirmed or suspected covid-19 who had illness lasting over 28 days found 45% of respondents had required a reduced work schedule, and another 23% had left the workforce because of suspected long covid.18 Long covid in children and young people could similarly jeopardise educational attainment. Long covid and disability Long covid itself may not be a disability but given its potentially debilitating effects on people\u2019s lives, it can be disabling. Long covid symptoms may also constitute disabilities because of loss of human function or because of a persistent impairment that undermines a person\u2019s quality of life.19 Another way in which long covid symptoms may be disabling is if a person experiences social discrimination or social subordination, wherein they lose status in society as a result of perceived \u201cdefective bodily functioning.\u201d1920 Some evidence suggests that people with long covid already experience discrimination. For example, in a cross sectional survey of 127 patients with long covid symptoms conducted between August 2020 and March 2021 in Japan, 55 people had experienced at least one form of discrimination and stigma, including being treated as if still contagious or being the subject of harmful rumours or verbal harassment.21 Subsequent research does not suggest attitudes have changed.22 People with long covid can also experience social isolation, stigma, and loss of social identity because of their inability to perform at work, maintain their relationships, care for their families, exercise, and so on.23 Clear diagnostic criteria facilitate care and legal recognition Long covid would be better understood as a potentially disabling condition if there were clinical diagnostic criteria to create meaningful pathways to care. This would benefit people with disabling symptoms in at least three ways. Firstly, those affected may need ongoing medical and allied care to retain or restore functions or to fulfil their life plans. Applications for state funded disability related health assistance usually require a clinical examination and sometimes a diagnostic code, such as an ICD-10 code. Diagnostic criteria for long covid may facilitate access to interventions and services that support social engagement and physical function (eg, hand rails, modified work environments, or access to rehabilitative therapy or psychiatric care). Clear diagnostic criteria\u2014supported by ongoing research into the underlying mechanisms of persistent symptoms24 \u2014might also reduce uncertainty and validate the experience of patients with long covid, including those who did not have access to testing at the time of presumed infection. A 2020 qualitative study in 24 patients with long covid identified uncertainty and being taken seriously as important concerns.25 The third and potentially more profound implication of establishing diagnostic criteria for long covid is in legal recognition of disability through instruments such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US and the Equality Act 2010 in the UK. Because people with long covid may experience long term, substantial impairment of their ability or autonomy to participate in society, in principle these instruments may already cover long covid. For example, the Equality Act covers discrimination on the grounds of \u201cprotected characteristics,\u201d one of which is disability, and can require employers and others to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d for people with disabilities. However, the widely variable presentations of long covid and absence of definitive diagnostic criteria or biomarkers may make it harder for patients to prove that they qualify as disabled. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act also requires people to prove qualification before they can claim a right to accommodations.26 This means that the disability must be recognised by a court rather than relying on self-reported limitations in a person\u2019s ability to undertake major life activities. Conversely, formally conceiving of long covid as a disability in law or policy is not the same as an individual determining whether their identity has changed to include \u201cdisabled.\u201d This creates a tension between self-identification as disabled and the law, where it is often necessary to have clear definitions and boundaries. Excessive focus on biomarkers or black and white diagnostic criteria for long covid could inadvertently exclude people who experience debilitating symptoms that do not fit accepted definitions of disease.27 Disability is not merely a medical phenomenon but a social one, and a loss of social function should be included as part of an assessment of disability. Given the strong grassroots and patient led movement to recognise long covid, patients and advocacy groups should be included in developing disease criteria as a basis for self-identification.28 The successes of disability rights movements and other movements such as HIV\/AIDS activism, in which self-advocacy formed the basis for change are instructive: nothing about us, without us.29 Establishing well defined criteria can empower people with long covid by providing a long term basis for coalitions and building communities. These can be leveraged into activism and political action to bring about social change, including by organising to motivate state responses to long covid. State obligations Diagnostic criteria can provide the basis for care and accommodations, but it is the state that is required to meet the needs of people with disabilities through medical care or other political, infrastructural, or welfare systems. In the case of long covid, these needs may be diverse. People with organ injury will require continued and robust access to affordable and accessible healthcare. Those whose symptoms impair mobility may require aids or modifications to their physical environments, like many other people with physical disabilities. People with cognitive deficits, profound fatigue, or psychiatric symptoms may require specific support\u2014for example, access to unemployment or other benefits, modifications to their work duties or schedule, or allowances for remote working when symptoms preclude commuting.30 Flexible attendance and modified activities for students with brain fog and other stress mediated effects of long covid may be necessary to support educational attainment.31 Increases in funding for, training, and availability of home care aides for families will arguably be needed when care givers and primary earners are affected by long covid. Many of these accommodations and improvements will arguably be best financed or accomplished through state intervention and may require policy interventions. For example, private firms may decide against the perceived additional expense of accessibility unless it is considered \u201creasonable\u201d and enforceable by legal protections such as the Equality Act in the UK. Given the potential scale of long covid, novel workplace legislation mandating the right to remote work and flexible work hours (for long covid as well as other important needs such as other disabilities, family illness, and childrearing) would improve accessibility. There may even be grounds to invert the status quo on accessibility and make the right to flexible work a presumption, effectively placing the onus on employers to justify on-site work requirements. For people whose symptoms flare or require additional medical leave, legislation introducing formal paid time off legislation in countries that do not have it would be a step towards an equitable society built on the recognition of disability. In other cases, accommodation may simply be a public good. Historically, mobility aids such as dropped kerbs in pavements allowing access to the road and ramps into or through buildings rather than stairs benefit people with a variety of mobility needs\u2014some, but not all, resulting from disability.32 These public works are typically achievable at scale only with state support and also benefit the broader population. These accommodations are social needs that predated the pandemic but are now critical with the rise of long covid. Crucially, support services are currently understaffed and under-resourced. The covid-19 pandemic has seen the degradation or collapse of welfare services, combined in some countries with decades of defunding and neglect.33 These services now have millions of new users. Recognition, respect, access to care, and an adjustment of our social norms and infrastructure have long been demands of disability activists. Covid-19, as in many other areas of life, may have shown the depth of our failures, but it did not create them. The emergence of long covid has made visible an emerging disability community that has the potential to shine a light on disability rights. What is now needed is a concerted political will to act to benefit the millions of individuals who are, or will become, disabled as a result of this global pandemic. Key messages The rise of long covid has created millions of new people with disabilities who will have to navigate the post-pandemic world The need for change to support people with disabilities predated the pandemic Long covid needs to be legally recognised as disabling through clinical research and practice The state must support people with long covid through expanded or reformed infrastructure and policy and by changing social norms Such changes will benefit all disabled people and wider society Footnotes Contributors and sources: The authors include philosophers, public health experts, and social scientists.

        "link":"https:\/\/americanfreepress.net\/judging-the-covid-19-pandemic-excess-deaths-is-the-best-metric\/",
        "text":"By Dr. Kevin Barrett The American people, polarized as never before, can hardly agree on anything. Between the hysteria purveyed by legacy fake news media on the left, and Fox News and \u201calternative facts\u201d on the right, the mainstream political discussion is a nonstop shouting match. (And yes, I realize that alternative facts are sometimes more factual than mainstream ones.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s witticism, \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d has never been more apropos. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be nice to have some trustworthy facts. Unfortunately, many of the establishment\u2019s key claims are debatable. Where, when, and how did Covid-19 emerge? Are the tests accurate? How many cases are there? How many actual deaths have occurred from Covid-19? Do lockdowns and masks really work? What are the most promising medications? Should ventilators be used, and if so, when? Could a safe and effective vaccine be devised quickly enough to help? The World Health Organization, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other establishment bureaucracies offer answers to these questions. But their answers often raise even more questions. The U.S. claim that Covid-19 emerged naturally in October from animals at a Wuhan market is almost certainly wrong, for too many reasons to list here. The mandate to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d is questionable given the dubious reliability of the tests. For that reason and others, nobody knows how many cases exist. Likewise, it isn\u2019t always clear which deaths are Covid deaths; the official counts may be too low or too high, depending on whom you believe. Likewise, the efficacy of masks is debatable, as is the question of whether a \u201ccocktail\u201d including hydroxychloroquine and zinc, or vitamins C and\/or D3, could be useful treatments. And the sensitive issue of whether ventilators have been saving patients or killing them is far from settled. Finally, the prospect of a workable vaccine, despite the billions of dollars being thrown at it, is uncertain to say the least. So, do we know anything about Covid-19? Do we even know there is a real pandemic out there? Yes, we do. The best metric, the one least likely to be wrong, is the excess death rate: the difference between the number of deaths expected to occur in a given time frame, and the number of deaths that actually occur. Though it may not always be clear whether someone died of Covid, with Covid, or of something else that could be mistaken for Covid, the fact that the person is dead is \u201cdead certain.\u201d Procedures for counting deaths are far more accurate than, say, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for counting viruses. What do overall death counts tell us? First takeaway: Prior to March 20, 2020, there were no discernable excess deaths in the U.S. Then suddenly, during the last 10 days in March, the overall death count shot up, peaking during the first two weeks of April, then quickly declining back to zero by mid-May. So, April, as TS Eliot said in another context, was indeed the cruelest month. (As of this writing, statistics for June are not yet available; but since reported Covid deaths are not keeping pace with reported new cases, it seems likely that the overall death count remained fairly flat in June.) The spike in excess deaths in April supports the establishment narrative in some ways, but also raises questions. It confirms that Covid-19 spread wildly in February and early March, leading to the spike in April deaths. It also confirms that the March and April lockdowns were presumably effective in slowing the spread of the virus, so that by mid-May there were no more discernable excess deaths in America. But wait! Officially, there were roughly 15,000 \u201cconfirmed Covid deaths\u201d between May 15 and June 1. Yet as we have seen, there seem to have been no overall excess deaths. Did 15,000 people who would have died otherwise somehow survive thanks to the Covid pandemic, balancing out the 15,000 Covid deaths? That seems unlikely. But it may be that the Covid emergency is somehow saving at least some lives\u2014especially the lives of young children. According to official statistics, \u201cStarting in early March, expected deaths (of children) began a sharp decline, from an expected level of around 700 deaths per week to well under 500 by mid April and throughout May.\u201d Has the drastic drop in childhood vaccinations been saving kids\u2019 lives? Or are infants receiving more and better attention from parents who are staying home rather than working? Bottom line: The Covid pandemic, and the bungling and confusing official response, has raised far more questions than answers. Those who want cold, hard facts should keep an eye on excess death statistics.

The statement shows the biblical basis and broad Christian support for taking the scientific findings about COVID-19 seriously in the present moment. Now, we as signers certainly don\u2019t agree on everything. We come from different political parties, different theological traditions, different racial and ethnic groups, different generations, and different parts of the country. We aren\u2019t trying to agree on public policy or what schools should do this fall. Such decisions require many considerations besides science; \u201cscience\u201d is not a one-word rationale for public policy. But we agree that the core scientific findings are valid and should not be rejected. We know all truth is God\u2019s truth, including the truths that biomedical researchers are discovering about the virus, how it spreads, and how to fight it. An individual scientist may be biased, but many scientists check each others\u2019 work and develop good protocols to give solid results. It\u2019s not a perfect process and one can always find dissenters, but scientists working together are far more accurate than one person\u2019s theory on YouTube. We are deeply concerned that many Christians are skeptical of well-established findings and not acting on them, at a time when thousands of lives are at stake. Because of our faith in Jesus Christ, we are committing ourselves to stand for the truth (1 Cor. 13:6) and to love our neighbors. Because of Jesus\u2019 command to care for \u201cthe least of these\u201d (Matthew 25:31-36), we are wearing masks and promoting vaccination. Because of God\u2019s passion for justice, we are caring not just for ourselves, but for the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. And we are committing to pray. To pray for the sick and the grieving. For elected leaders. For parents and teachers. For doctors and nurses. For researchers developing treatments and vaccines. And we pray for our cities and nation; may God bring healing, justice, and flourishing for all (Jeremiah 29:7). Will you join us? Please read the statement and prayerfully consider signing it. If you sign it, be sure to send it on to others and encourage them to do the same.

In this video, I want to explain why the COVID vaccine is definitely not the mark of the beast described in Revelation 13. I invite you to learn the reasons why I believe this so strongly, because doing so will help you read the Bible with greater knowledge and greater hope. Reading approaches How one answers the question, \u201cIs the COVID vaccine the \u2018mark of the beast\u2019 depends greatly on one\u2019s reading approach to the book of Revelation, the final book in the Bible. The Christians who fear the vaccine being the \u201cmark of the beast \u201c have been taught a particular reading approach: to read Revelation as a prophecy of \u201cthe end times.\u201d I actually grew up with this \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. When I was 10 years old, as a kid in Faith Bible Church in the Midwest, I was given a comic book version of a very popular book among Christians during that time called \u201cThe Late, Great Planet Earth,\u201d written by an author named Hal Lindsey. The book was influential in promoting the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach to Revelation. I remember very vividly the comic book illustrations of the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d passage. The drawing style made the world seem so ominous. I was afraid that some new technology in the world might actually be the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d I was afraid that I might somehow get accidentally tagged by the mark. I was afraid that the end times were approaching. And I was afraid that the end times would happen before I got my first girlfriend. Seriously, I was really afraid of that! I no longer have those fears because over the years, as I have studied to become a pastor and now a seminary professor, I have learned to read that passage and the entire book of Revelation with a different reading approach. Let\u2019s call this the \u201cfirst century\u201d approach. Now, from my years of study, I do strongly believe that the \u201cfirst century\u201d reading approach is more faithful to the Biblical author\u2019s intentions. However, I\u2019m also aware from my own personal experience how many Christians still adhere to the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. And like I said, I know firsthand how much of an emotional impression that the \u201cend times\u201d approach can make. If that is true for you, I\u2019d like to invite you to just consider with an open mind the reading approach I\u2019m about to describe. Think of it like this: you\u2019ve been wearing one set of reading glasses. I\u2019m going to offer you to try another set on. If you don\u2019t think my version helps you see more clearly, you can always go back to your old one. When you\u2019re trying on new glasses, it\u2019s helpful to compare them side by side, to switch between the two and see which produces more clarity. I believe this side by side comparison can be characterized by the following: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Reading a compass versus reading a map Reading with hope versus reading with fear Comparison #1: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Let\u2019s start with the first comparison: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Here is the actual passage about the mark of the beast in Revelation 13:16-18: \u201cIt causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: anyone with decent understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.\u201d Revelation 13: 16-18 The \u201cend times\u201d reading approach treats this passage like a crystal ball. In this approach, the author of Revelation was thousands of years ago gazing into the future, and predicting that some monstrous institution \u2013 \u201cthe beast\u201d \u2013 would force everyone to adopt some practice, one that is somehow associated with the number \u201c666.\u201d And that event would mark the nearness of the end of the world. Throughout modern history, some Christians have used this reading approach to claim that a particular institution of the day was the beast predicted by Revelation 13. The institution was usually one that the reader was already suspicious of in the first place. When social security was rolled out in the 1930\u2019s to political controversy, some opponents who were Christians labeled \u201cthe beast\u201d as the administration of FDR, and the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d was the assigned social security number. In the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, when giant telephone companies were seen as part of the shift from agricultural rural life to technological urban life, rural Christians labeled these companies \u201cthe beast.\u201d They said the newly assigned three digit area codes were the three digit \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d The same pattern occurred with large financial institutions in the 1970\u2019s with the roll out of credit card numbers, in the 1980\u2019s bar codes and 1990\u2019s with computers and the Internet, in the 2000\u2019s with RFID technology that can track objects, and so on. And now, it\u2019s happening with the vaccine. The beast is the government, or the CDC, or some other institution. And the vaccine shot itself is the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d There is even the false rumor that some sort of tracking feature is built into the vaccine. The historical pattern of the crystal ball approach should alert us that something is wrong with this reading approach. With each crystal ball reading throughout the years, the end times does not occur as predicted. The predicted beast ends up not being that horrible. Yet, each generation keeps updating to another prediction, another match \u2013 again, with the match fitting pre-existing suspicions. The Bible actually has very stern warnings about any one who presumes to offer any crystal ball reading. Deuteronomy 18:22 cautions: \u201cIf what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.\u201d Deuteronomy 18:22 \u201cSpeaking presumptuously\u201d means when someone is imposing one\u2019s own feelings, including one\u2019s own suspicions, on to God\u2019s word. Anyone who tries to read Revelation as a crystal ball is especially risking this judgment of presumption because the author did not write it for this purpose. Reading Revelation as a crystal ball is actually misreading the kind of literature the book is. Revelation is a type of first century literature that as the title suggests, is meant to \u201creveal.\u201d But what is being revealed is not primarily the future, but the spiritual meaning of the historic events happening in the first century world of the original audience. Revelation isn\u2019t talking about \u201cthe end times\u201d for most of the book: it doesn\u2019t get to anything close to that time horizon until the very last chapters. Revelation 1:4 makes it very clear the intended audience: \u201cJohn, to the seven churches in Asia\u2026\u201d Revelation 1:4 The intended audience is the seven first century churches in Western Asia. The next three chapters makes this even more clear as John, the author, reveals the spiritual condition of those seven churches at the time of writing. He is casting a spiritual X-Ray to show them what is really happening in their own congregations. In the ensuing chapters, John then trains this spiritual X-Ray to the wider world. There is nothing to indicate that he\u2019s shifting time frames. He\u2019s just shifting to the secular world, to revealing to first century Christians the spiritual meaning behind those first century world historical events. And this is where the crystal ball approach gets off track: it misinterprets Biblical X-Ray language for what we think is crystal ball language. The type of first century literature that does this kind of X-Ray reading of world events routinely used extreme metaphorical language to describe the underlying spiritual realities. So Revelation is full of passages that describe the sky falling, the mountains crashing, the seas erupting with beasts. If read literally, these passages do sound ominous, like the world is ending. And that\u2019s why some Christians have assumed Revelation is making predictions about some future where the world quite literally ends. It is helpful to remember that even today, we also use extreme metaphorical language to reveal the underlying spiritual or emotional reality behind significant world events. The virus has been described as an \u201cearth shattering\u201d event. The nation \u201cheld its breath\u201d for the presidential election results. Obviously, the virus did not physically break apart the earth\u2019s surface. Obviously, the entire country did not cease to take in oxygen for a week. We have to read Revelation as using the first century version of such metaphorical language to reveal the spiritual and emotional realities of their first century world events. Since most readers aren\u2019t familiar with first century metaphors or first century historical events, we should approach Revelation with a trusted and accessible Bible commentary. I personally recommend N.T. Wright\u2019s Revelation for Everyone. Wright is probably the leading Bible scholar of the day and yet he writes in an extremely accessible and succinct fashion in this book. Also, our friends at The Bible Project have some excellent videos on this topic (and they\u2019re much less scary than my Hal Lindsey comic book!). Comparison #2: Reading a compass vs. reading a map Even though I believe that Revelation cannot be read as a crystal ball, I can understand the attraction to this approach. The crystal ball approach \u2013 even if it is mistaken in my view \u2013 is nevertheless a way of making Revelation relevant to us today. If one only reads Revelation as revealing the spiritual meaning of first century world events, then what\u2019s the point of us reading it today? This gets to a second reading comparison. To explain this difference, I\u2019m going to change metaphors a bit. I believe we have to read Revelation as a compass versus reading it as a map. When we are reading a map like this \u2013 and I realize that those of you under the age 20 may have never glimpsed such an object like this \u2013 we are making a one to one equation. This dot equals this specific town and this town only. This line equals this specific road and this road only. If we want to read Revelation as a map making one to one equations, we have to do so with the first century world. We can do that with precision in the mark of the beast passage. It is historically documented that the first century Christians were under enormous pressure to conform to a growing practice of worshipping the Roman emperor. You can draw a one to one equation from \u201cthe beast\u201d to the Roman emperor: it was common for Scripture to use the metaphorical language of beasts to reveal the dehumanizing and vicious spiritual reality behind pagan rulers. Revelation makes that equation even more obvious by identifying the mark of the beast as 666. There was a common code in first century Hebrew literature that identified letters to numbers, and in that code, 666 translates precisely into the word \u201cNero\u201d \u2013 the specific Roman emperor of that day. So, read as a map, the passage clearly wants the first century Christian to avoid bowing down to Nero and getting too closely identified with him. The language about getting branded with \u201c666\u201d is the metaphorical way of saying: beware that everyone in the first century world doesn\u2019t brand Christians politically. Make sure that everyone doesn\u2019t just assume Christians worship Nero like the rest of the pagan world. Now, if we want to discern the relevance of Revelation for our world today, we have to read the text differently. We have to read it like this thing: like a compass. A compass does not make one to one equations to a previously mapped world. Rather, a compass equips you to navigate your path in what may be an unfamiliar world. A compass gives you an orientation, a way to make your way in the world now before you. And a compass orients you by pointing you to the True North. Now, the two ways of reading \u2013 a compass and a map \u2013 are related. As we read Revelation as a map, we are seeing how the Biblical author was guiding the first century Christian church. We can trace God\u2019s intended route for them. The more we follow those first century routes, the more we end up with a compass, \u201cOh so, that is how God wants his people to navigate the world in general.\u201d So, let\u2019s try to turn Revelation 13 from a map into a compass. We should beware of any one to one connection that confidently equates \u201cthe beast\u201d or \u201c666\u201d to any current political leader or current political identification. But we can read this passage as a kind of general orientation for Christians on how to navigate politics in our world. Here\u2019s my reading of the passage as a compass: I believe it is telling Christians in general throughout all ages, to navigate their political world by avoiding any complete and total identification with any political leader or party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right. Don\u2019t bow down to any one leader. And as Christians, don\u2019t let yourself get politically branded, such that being a Christian automatically equals being a member of a particular political party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right. That\u2019s my version of reading Revelation 13 as a compass. You may of course discern your own version. I\u2019m sharing mine simply to offer an illustrative example of what is an appropriate way to rely on Revelation to navigate our current world. Christians can differ on the specifics of how different Biblical passages operate as compasses. But what all Christians should agree on is the True North. The most important way that a compass guides navigation is by pointing you to True North. And this leads to my final comparison. This is reading with hope versus reading with fear. Comparison #3: Reading with hope versus reading with fear Like I said, the end times reading approach made me afraid of many things for many years. The tragedy was that causing fear is the exact opposite intention of Revelation. If you read passages like Revelation 13 as a compass, they are pointing to the final chapters of the book. This is when the book does shift its time horizon to the end. But it is the end, not of the very existence of the world, but rather the end of its struggles and suffering. The final chapters of Revelation depict what has always been the Biblical picture of Christian hope for the world. Revelation 21:2-4 states it beautifully: \u201cAnd I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. 4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.\u201d Revelation 21:2-4 Notice that the end is God coming down from heaven to earth to be with humans and restore humanity. The end is not some devastating series of events. The end is not the destruction of the world. The end is the return of God \u2013 in the person of Jesus \u2013 back to this world. To dwell with us, to wipe away every tear, to end death and suffering. This is our true North Star. This is the future that gives us hope for this world. Reading Revelation all the way to the end assures us that even when it seems like the world right now is captive to tears, death, and suffering, that is not the final state. As Christians, we have every reason to live as people of hope, not fear. Final appeal The priority of hope over fear is the reason why all Christians should stop fearing the mark of the beast. Even if you want to stick with an end times reading approach to Revelation, you should avoid interpretations that create fear in you. This is because all Christians have been given something even better than a reading approach. We\u2019ve been given a personal reading guide. This personal reading guide is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is like a tutor at our side when we read Scripture, telling us, \u201cNo, don\u2019t read it this, read it that way.\u201d And how do you know when you are reading with the Holy Spirit\u2019s active guidance? 2 Timothy 1:7 makes this clear: \u201cFor God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:7 A Spirit guided reading leads you away from fear. Fear makes you feel powerless, suspicious (which is the opposite of love), and out of control. But the Holy Spirit seeks to give us a feeling of being empowered, being loved, and that things are under control. Most of all, the Holy Spirit points you to the True North, to the reassuring promise that our God will one day end suffering, disease, and death itself. This is why I believe that if you want to locate the vaccine in Revelation, don\u2019t equate it one to one with the mark of the beast. Rather, locate the vaccine as a hopeful pointer, a compass indicating God\u2019s promise that he himself will return one day to end all suffering and death. The vaccine of course is just a pointer \u2013 it itself won\u2019t end all suffering and death for good. Only God\u2019s return to earth can do that. But pointers give us hope, they give us some indication of what is to come. The vaccine has the potential to do just that: to give us hope, to give an indication that there is an end to suffering and death. Let\u2019s follow that pointer. Let\u2019s be people not of fear, but of hope.",

        "text":"3. The sooner the better Widespread vaccination is the fastest and most permanent way to stop the spread. Nearly half a million people in the United States have already died of COVID-19 and millions more have been sick. Many others are struggling\u2014those who\u2019ve lost jobs, the lonely, those suffering mental illness, the healthcare workers serving on the front lines, and the teachers and kids dealing with online school. All of this will end as soon as we stamp out this virus! You can help your community by getting the vaccine as soon as you are eligible. 4. COVID-19 vaccines are ethical Many Christians are concerned about the possible use of fetal cells in vaccines. The good news is that no vaccines contain human cells! Moreover, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not use human cells even in the production process. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does use a human cell line in production; this is an immortal cell line that came from a fetus aborted in 1985 (the abortion was not performed for this purpose). Yet even here, the cells used today are descended many generations from the original fetus and were never part of an actual human body. While the association with abortion gives many Christians pause, there is substantial agreement among Christian theologians and ethicists that the connection to fetal cell lines should not make these vaccines off-limits for Christians; see our Common Question on vaccines for more. 5. The disease is riskier than the vaccine No vaccine is 100% risk-free, just as no medical procedure is risk free. Christians need to weigh the risks on both sides. COVID-19 is a serious disease, much worse than the flu. By now we\u2019ve all known people who have had it. Some people have mild cases but others have serious symptoms, hospitalization, and long-term complications. The risks of the vaccine are less than the risks of the disease. Our Common Question on vaccines weighs the risks in more detail.",

        "title":"Tim Keller & Francis Collins | Where is God in a Pandemic?",
        "link":"https:\/\/biologos.org\/podcast-episodes\/tim-keller-francis-collins-where-is-god-in-a-pandemic",
        "text":"Stump: Welcome to Language of God. I\u2019m your host, Jim Stump. This is a podcast about science and faith, and there are no two people who represent these better than Francis Collins and Tim Keller. Collins is one of the top scientists in the world, having led the Human Genome Project and now directing the National Institutes of Health; and Keller is one of the most respected pastors and authors of his generation. Most people who know something about BioLogos know that we were founded by Francis Collins. But fewer people are aware that Tim Keller had an important hand in our success. In the early days of BioLogos, there was a huge amount of suspicion from more conservative Christians about whether the science of evolution could be reconciled with the essentials of Christian faith. Keller has not hidden the fact that he himself has concerns about that. But he thought the conversation was important. So he hosted a series of private meetings in Manhattan where such conversations could take place between prominent faith leaders and scientists. Out of those meetings there was some trust that developed, without which BioLogos would not have been able to gain a hearing. And there was also a lasting friendship that developed between Tim and Francis. In these days of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of them are busier than ever, and we were so thankful they gave of their time to talk to each other and to us about specific challenges the church and the world are facing right now. This was originally recorded as a livestream event on May 18, 2020. A link to the video of that is available in the show notes. Just two days after that event, there was a very exciting announcement that Francis has been named the 2020 Templeton Prize Laureate \u2014 an award given each year to honor someone who has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life\u2019s spiritual dimension. The prize has previously been given to Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham, among others. We have links in the show notes to information about that, as well as to other things both Collins and Keller have written for the BioLogos website. At the end of the conversation, we\u2019re joined by BioLogos president Deb Haarsma who offers a prayer for both Collins and Keller. I think this episode gives some fascinating insights into this moment in history from two people who are uniquely positioned to guide us through it. Let\u2019s get to the conversation. Interview Stump: Thank you Tim and Francis. I know being quarantined at home does not mean there are fewer demands on your time. So thank you very much for this time that you\u2019ve given all of us tonight. If we could, let\u2019s just start briefly so the audience can hear that there\u2019s a broader context to this conversation and that you\u2019re not just a couple of random people we paired together. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with each other, maybe when you became aware of each other\u2019s work, when you met, how you\u2019ve kept that relationship going? Francis, start us off, if you would. Collins: Sure. Well, I knew of Tim as a pastor of Redeemer Church in New York City, which was rather famous for the way it had brought together people from all sorts of different perspectives, including lots of young urban professionals. And I actually dropped in on his church one Sunday morning when I was in New York and was totally inspired by what I saw and what I heard and the deeply thoughtful way in which he approached scripture. And so I approached him probably a few months later. I was in New York for, I think it was the Q conference that was happening, and it was a Saturday I think, and I thought, you know, I\u2019ll just take a chance here and see if Reverend Keller might actually be around, expecting there would be this huge hedge that would be protecting him from the rabble like me. But instead, he was quite available and quite happy to talk. And I guess I probably went straight to my concern about how science and faith didn\u2019t seem to be getting along very well and this seemed like a bad thing for the Christian Church as well as for the scientific community and wondered what he thought about that. And I think he almost immediately bonded about this being a problem that really is vexing the future of the church and maybe we together had a pretty interesting conversation about what we might do about it. Which then ultimately led to a friendship and to involvement by Tim and BioLogos, which has tried, for its very essence to do exactly that\u2014bring scientists and people of faith together and figure out how we can learn from each other and even worship together. Stump: What do you remember of those days, Tim? Was Francis really the rabble that he says he may have been? Keller: No, not at all. I\u2019m sorry to start off our hour by saying that he\u2019s just wrong. I read his book, Language of God, I quote the book in Reason for God, which I wrote in 2007\u2014Language of God came out in 2006\u2014so my memory is that when Francis Collins wanted to see me, I felt honored. So there goes that whole rabble theory. Gone. And so that must have been after both those books were out, Francis. I\u2019m pretty sure. And then the first two or three times that we had conferences, consultations, that basically turned into BioLogos, I was a co-leader of those right here in New York City. And we\u2019ve kept our relationship up since then. Stump: How have you kept up your relationship? I can\u2019t imagine you see each other every day. But? Keller: Well, sometimes we actually have emailed back and forth on issues of human origins where we don\u2019t agree. Collins: There are some. Keller: It\u2019s also true. That it is possible, by the way, to be friends and disagree. I\u2019m also kind of an outlier member of a reading group that Francis is in with other people who are in DC. And occasionally I drop in on that. So that we\u2019ve kept it up somehow. It\u2019s not been easy. Collins: Yeah. And I\u2019ve even occasionally dropped in on your church in New York, if I knew you were preaching, which I guess you do less of these days, but boy, it\u2019s been wonderful to have a chance to learn from you. Stump: Well, let\u2019s move to the topic at hand at hand. This pandemic has radically changed all of our lives. Would each of you share just a bit of how it\u2019s affecting you personally? Tim, you live and work in New York City, the epicenter of this outbreak. What\u2019s that done to your normal rhythms of life at work? Keller: Well, I\u2019m no different than anyone else. It\u2019s been completely disruptive of normal rhythms. Two things I could say about how it\u2019s affected me personally. One is, first of all, my wife and I stayed here. And that\u2019s the first thing and that\u2019s worth talking about. Martin Luther, many years ago obviously, wrote a fascinating piece on whether\u2026it\u2019s Whether One May Flee a Deadly Plague. That\u2019s the name of it. And it\u2019s on the internet, easy to find. And what\u2019s remarkable about it, it\u2019s very biblical and very brave and yet, that his answer is, it depends. May a Christian flee? It depends. He says it is absolutely okay, considering the value God puts on human life, to do what it takes to preserve your own life. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve got a duty of any kind in a place where it\u2019s dangerous, Christians should not flee because they should be not afraid to die. We\u2019re not quite there. On the other hand, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church, I\u2019m not the pastor of any one church now, I work for Redeemer City to City, which helps churches get started in big cities around the world. But nevertheless, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church for 30 years, and it did feel like I should stay. So I\u2019m following Martin Luther. So we stayed, though it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. And nevertheless, we stayed. Number two, we\u2019ve grieved a lot. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of physical devastation here because I work with Redeemer City to City, we\u2019re involved with churches across the city and so many churches, especially in less well resourced neighborhoods, we could say, have really been devastated. There\u2019s one church that we reconnected with that there\u2019s 13 people that have died in it. Then there\u2019s the economic devastation. There\u2019s social devastation. An awful lot of the kids in the schools, where they were already behind in the poor areas, those are the folks that are not keeping up with online, you know, instruction, etc. And so the kids that were far behind or are getting further behind so there\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s grievous. And one last thing to say is, when you go week after week after week without any good news, you\u2019re either reading about the virus or you\u2019re reading about something that\u2019s not the virus, it\u2019s usually bad news, it drains you spiritually. And I can feel it, especially here, where people were rightly concerned about infection because we were in the middle of such a hotspot. So it\u2019s been difficult, even though, you know, God has kept both me and my wife free from the virus and our immediate family most of which lives here have also not been touched. Nevertheless, it\u2019s been\u2026 We stay, we\u2019ve grieved. Stump: How about you, Francis, working in Washington DC and balancing scientific work with public perception and even politics, I\u2019m sure has made a whole other dimension to all of this for you. Collins: Yeah, you could say that. Well, I\u2019m speaking to you tonight from my home office, which is where I have essentially been for the last eight weeks. I have only maybe four times left the house to go to any official duty thing. I\u2019ve been running NIH from this desk right here. All those books behind me are my library on science and faith. And I occasionally have to pull those down to get myself some encouragement. But it is an incredibly intense time because you feel this incredible sense of urgency about marshaling every possible scientific capability, bringing all the bright brains of the planet together and trying to figure out how can we quickly move forward identifying treatments for people who are sick with COVID-19, speeding up the development of those vaccines that everybody\u2019s waiting for, coming up with new ways to do testing that are easier for people to have access to. All of that is right smack in the middle of NIH\u2019s wheelhouse. That\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re the largest supporter of medical research in the world and we\u2019re all hands on deck. But it\u2019s weird doing this through Zoom meetings and conference calls and piles of email beyond anything I could have imagined. And yet trying to keep the momentum going, trying to encourage the morale of my staff who are scattered all over the place, many of them working from home, many of them worried about themselves, their families. And we in our own staff at NIH have had close to 200 people who\u2019ve been infected. Fortunately, most of them done well. But this is very real all around us. It\u2019s not just a scientific adventure. It\u2019s life and death. And I\u2019ve done a lot of scientific adventures, but nothing that quite has this sense of acute urgency. Stump: We last talked about six weeks ago, Francis, in this format, at which time there had been about 10,000 deaths in the US. Now we\u2019re up to almost ten times that many. Is that what you expected of all of this? Or have we flattened the curve or what do we expect from here? Collins: Well, it would have been worse if we had not had Americans do what Americans have been doing, which is to accept those recommendations about staying at home and practicing social distancing and washing their hands and wearing masks now wherever you go outside, not to protect yourself, but to protect other people from you in case you happen to be carrying the virus, and simply by the act of speaking, you may be spreading it around. I\u2019m really impressed with our nation, where people have taken this upon themselves for the most part without having an autocratic government tell them that you have to but doing it because it is the right thing to do. It would have been, I\u2019m sure, much worse had those steps not been taken. But it is still intensely tragic. Those numbers, after a while you\u2019re sort of numbed by them. I look at them every morning because we have a team that meets at 7:30 to see where we are. And every time there\u2019s another 1500, 2000 deaths in America. And it\u2019s heartbreaking to imagine that each one of those represents a terrible tragedy of a lost soul that this virus has claimed. And you sort of feel like we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to try to bend that curve back down. New York has done a pretty amazing job of getting over the top of their curve and coming back down, although they have a long way to go. But a lot of the rest of the country has not actually achieved that yet. And I worry that people are just getting exhausted with this whole business of physical distancing and wanting relief and wanting to be out in the sunshine because it\u2019s starting to be really nice weather. And we still have a terrible risk of another wave of this if we don\u2019t do this in a very careful, sensible way. Stump: Tim, talk about the church\u2019s response a little bit to all of this, the good, the bad, and the ugly, perhaps. What have you seen that makes you proud of the body of Christ? What are some things that perhaps we could be doing better? Keller: Well, I would say you left something out good, bad, ugly. I would say there\u2019s also the non. That is to say I\u2019m not sure on the whole the church has responded yet. There\u2019s been an extremely small percentage of churches that have, you know, defied government directives, and they are because of the publicity they get, there seems to be far more than there really are. And that\u2019s the bad or the ugly. However\u2026after 9\/11 in New York City, where really this was the place where we had the devastation of 9\/11, everybody came together immediately. As a matter of fact, all the churches were jammed. People who never went to church came, and what you were able to do is you\u2019re able to speak words of comfort to the whole community in those churches. We were able to immediately get out there to start to help the unemployed, immediately get out there to give aid to people who had been traumatized. We were able to immediately respond and actually the quarantine means that we actually can\u2019t do what churches do. So in some ways, I would say there\u2019s going to be two periods. There\u2019s going to be the interim period when the lockdowns, the restrictions start to ease up. I call that an interim period where there\u2019s still gonna be restrictions, but there\u2019ll be coming off in stages. And then after that, which is the immediate aftermath, even when the restrictions are gone, let\u2019s say the vaccines out there, there\u2019s going to be all sorts of\u2014well we\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re going to be yet\u2014cultural, social and economic effects that are going to last for a while. And in that situation, basically, and this is an overstatement perhaps but this is how you get people to listen. All churches are going to have to get replanted. See we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s there. When we reconvene, who will be there? I\u2019m a church planter. I planted Redeemer and City to City, the organization I work with, helps new churches get started across the city and it takes a lot of ingenuity. It takes tremendous focus on people outside the church. You can\u2019t ignore them. You have to say what is the needs of our neighborhood? Secondly, it takes a tremendous amount of concentration on what are the needs of people inside the church, you can\u2019t just run programs, you know, and get up there and preach your sermon and draw your paycheck. You\u2019ve got to meet needs inside, meet needs outside, and you\u2019ve also got to be innovative. You\u2019ve got to be thinking about the new situation and how do I maximize opportunities that come from this new situation? How do I minimize the disadvantages? That\u2019s how you plant a church. And unfortunately, I think all churches are going to have to get replanted. And we\u2019re all going to have to say, how do we meet needs inside, outside, and how do we respond to these changes? And that will be a test. So I would say so far 95% of churches have not yet responded. And in the next two periods after this, there will be\u2026it will really be a test. There\u2019s a great chance for witness to the presence of the kingdom and to the reality of Jesus in this time, but it\u2019s also I would say, we haven\u2019t actually met the test yet. Collins: Tim, it must be really tough on pastors though right now who are trying to figure out how to find their role in the midst of such an unexpected crisis and where they can\u2019t even bring people together, they can\u2019t go to funerals and preside and try to provide comfort to the grieving. It must be just unbelievable. You had a piece that somebody pointed me to, a video to pastors, which was intended for them, but I think it spoke to me too, as an encouragement about the things that one might do in this circumstance. And I think you started it off by saying, it\u2019s like when you\u2019re on an airplane and you haven\u2019t quite taken off yet and they\u2019re going through the drill, and they say something about if the oxygen mask falls from the ceiling, put on yours first, before you help the person next to you. Those pastors must be in need of oxygen, because what they\u2019re going through right now must be pretty incredibly intense and exhausting. Keller: Yeah, thanks, Francis. Number one, you might remember from that, I got a phone call three days after 9\/11, I got a phone call from a pastor from Oklahoma City, who had said that after the bombing in 1995, and all the crisis there, the churches and all the ministers went into tremendous overdrive. And about a year later, they all realized\u2014they started going into depression, marriages started to break up\u2014that they had actually burned out. And they didn\u2019t realize the degree to which they\u2019ve been drained. And so what I was trying to say there is\u2026by the way that oxygen mask illustration, my wife who\u2019s probably watching right now, it was her idea to say you\u2019re not going to help anybody else in the plane unless you got your oxygen mask on. And if you burn yourself out, and you die a slow death of despair underneath, while you\u2019re smiling because of course, adrenaline, the great wonder drug, lasts for a while. And then after a while, you just collapse. So you do have to put on your oxygen mask. Collins: Good advice for everybody who\u2019s listening here tonight, whether you\u2019re a pastor, or you\u2019re a parent, or you\u2019re a teacher struggling with not having your students there and trying to make the doggone internet do its purpose for your classes\u2026 Put on your oxygen mask people. You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself as well. Stump: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about vaccines. Collins: Oh why not! Stump: And Francis, I saw an article that you published today with the chief officer at Johnson and Johnson about the need for federal agencies to collaborate with private industry and pharmaceutical companies to develop this as quickly as possible. I\u2019ll ask you if you\u2019ll talk a little bit about that effort. And then, Tim, if you\u2019d chime in at some point here and maybe help us in understanding the church\u2019s reaction to vaccines. That\u2019s certainly painting with too broad of a brush. But maybe we\u2019ll get into talking about some conspiracies\u2026 Collins: Oh good. [laughs] Stump: And how we who call ourselves Christians are particularly prone to this with regard to vaccines, but let\u2019s hear some of the science here first, Francis. Collins: Well, I could go on for hours but you probably don\u2019t want me to, so let me try to put this into a fairly concise narrative. If you want to see this coronavirus pandemic really come to a satisfactory close, a vaccine is by far the best hope we have. But it\u2019s also extremely challenging to make it happen. We\u2019ve never built a vaccine, in all of history, in less than about three or four years. And here we are trying to do it in 12 to 18 months, as Tony Fauci has often said. And maybe even trying to push the envelope a bit on that timetable. So there is an enormous amount of scientific effort going into this with a variety of very novel approaches that have never really been done before for vaccines that are looking pretty good. One that was just reported on this morning, a vaccine that was developed so fast that it was in its first human trials 63 days after the first report of this virus from China. Usually that\u2019s like many months, 63 days, not bad. And the results of that phase one trial, where you\u2019re just checking this out in volunteers to see if it\u2019s safe and whether it produces a good immune response, looks really good. Well, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re there yet. That means you need now to expand that to give this to thousands of people in an area where the virus is currently circulating, to see, did it protect them? If you don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re now moving quickly to try to scale that up to that large scale study. And that\u2019s just one vaccine, there are four or five that are coming along pretty quickly, that all have a different kind of scientific basis, which is good, because probably not all of these are going to work. I just want one of them to work. The other thing we have to do is prepare for the fact that one of them might work and then you\u2019re going to have to scale this up. You\u2019re going to have this huge manufacturing problem, where you need to make hundreds of millions of doses. If you wait until you have the results of the full scale trial, and then start your manufacturing, you just lost several months where people are dying from this disease. So what we\u2019re doing now, thank you taxpayers, is basically to support the scale-up of the manufacturing even before we know what\u2019s going to work. So a lot of that may go to waste, but some of it we are hoping will turn out to be right. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what this timetable will look like. But I will say, particularly through this mechanism we are now invested in and working very closely with no less than 18 companies that are working on this, we are moving faster than humanity has ever seen before. And we\u2019re determined not to worry about who gets the credit, or who makes any money, but just basically let\u2019s get it done and get it out there and try to save people who otherwise are going to be a terrible risk. Stump: Lots of our listeners are asking these questions about vaccines and conspiracies right now. And this is what I\u2019m asking you, Tim, to channel for us a little bit, if you can, the American psyche and all of this, as Rob is asking, \u201cWe\u2019re hearing lots of conspiracy theories, particularly from Christian quarters.\u201d Any thoughts from either of you actually, how do we respond to people like that? And maybe Tim, I\u2019ll give you a little plug here because I\u2019ve been going through your new book that just came out here recently, Uncommon Ground with John Inazu, where you talk about how do we get along with people who think differently than us? You\u2019re not writing about conspiracy theorists in there, but perhaps there\u2019s some wisdom for all of us to take and how we respond to the people on our social media feeds. Keller: Well, let me start by first of all asking, Francis, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to scroll back. Francis, would you say the players are by and large showing a willingness to put profits and credit aside? You said that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to not care about who gets credit, not care about who\u2019s making a lot of money. But would you say that the usual suspects are actually doing a good job there? Collins: I think they are. I think they recognize this as a crisis that demands that. I even heard a leader of a pharmaceutical company saying to another rival, \u201cYou know, if your drug actually looks like it\u2019s better than mine, why don\u2019t we use my clinical trial network to expand your drug\u2019s testing, so we\u2019ll really know as soon as possible.\u201d I would not have heard that in any other setting. This is different. Keller: No. What\u2019s what\u2019s good about that, by the way\u2014and I know, I\u2019m not following our moderator here, immediately\u2014but what\u2019s great about that is that is, well, there\u2019s a lot of talk today about the fact that this crisis has not united us. And it is true to some degree politically. After 9\/11 I saw a much more uniting going on than I do this time. And there is a lot of political polarization and it is a problem. Nevertheless, there is some coming together and it might be in the medical pharmaceutical\u2026 If it happens there, then we really can be very, very grateful. That\u2019s all, so. Collins: Well that\u2019s a nice thought. Keller: Yeah, to get back to your question now. You\u2019re struggling to get both Francis Collins and Tim Keller to both say something intelligent about vaccines. [laughs] I don\u2019t know a thing about vaccines! So, but what you\u2019re really asking is, there seems to be something of a real suspicion, well on the part of many, many people, about scientific expertise in this country. And it seems to be particularly acute amongst Christians and evangelical Christians. And I think that\u2019s fair. But let me just say two things. If you were asking how do you reach out to people who are different than you? Well, by both critiquing and affirming, I mean, always. If you just simply say, \u201cYou\u2019re totally wrong,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re totally right,\u201d you\u2019re not actually reaching out. Now, here\u2019s where I want to\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t mind Francis responding to especially this first one\u2014is Christians have got some reason to be wary, not so much of scientists, but of people who come, trying to make a case for something and invoking science. When actually they\u2019re making moral decisions, or philosophical, they\u2019re making philosophical arguments and they\u2019re cloaking it in science. So for example, there really are a fair number of scientists who will take their cultural capital they have a scientist, because science has a lot of cultural capital, because of all the accomplishments, and they\u2019ll say science, not too many, but there will be scientists who will say, \u201cscience proves that there\u2019s no God, that there\u2019s no soul, that there\u2019s nothing beyond this and science tells us these things.\u201d And Francis knows that we could, I\u2019m not gonna mention, we could name, there\u2019s a lot of them right now, that are making a lot of money and books saying science tells us these things. And so Christians look at that and we say, \u201cuh, well what about Francis Collins, I\u2019m sorry, science does not tell you these things and for you to be\u2026\u201d That\u2019s maybe what you might want to call scientism, which is a philosophy that says there is no knowledge other than what can be empirically proven. And there is no, there\u2019s no reality outside of the natural and material. And so when you know that that\u2019s happened, and you there\u2019s a history to that at that. At that point, you know, you can see why Christians will start to get wary of people coming in saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this, this agenda and it\u2019s totally scientific.\u201d Actually, the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas has a great little line, where he says, \u201cscience can tell you what you can do and what you can\u2019t do and how to do it efficiently but science can never tell you whether or not you ought to do it.\u201d That\u2019s always going to be a moral decision. And that\u2019s a matter of faith. And therefore, you really shouldn\u2019t be throwing this on the scientists. The scientists give you the facts. They do give you the facts. But then decisions that we made on the basis of more than just that. And so I can understand that wariness. On the other hand, Christians should know better and here\u2019s where I would push back badly on folks. Herbert Butterfield some years ago, wrote a classic book called the, let me see, I wrote it down here, The Origins of Modern Science. Stump: The Origins of Modern Science Keller: Yeah. Right. And he basically makes his case there that says, you know, Buddhism and Hinduism, didn\u2019t believe the physical world was real. Other ancient pagan views saw the creation always, you can look at their myths, the creation was always a result of some kind of major battle of some kind. You know, nature is basically chaotic. It\u2019s power poles fighting against each other. Along comes Christianity and says, there\u2019s one God, a personal God, who creates the world as an artist, a rational God as it were. And it\u2019s in that soil that science can grow. Because the idea is, oh, there\u2019s nature and there\u2019s a uniformity to nature and there\u2019s an orderliness to nature. And the reality is that Christianity, it was in the Christian West, where the whole idea of modern science grew up because of the view of God. Then you can just go to the Bible and you see, I won\u2019t, I\u2019ve taken too long on this question anyway. You know, Jesus knows the difference between sick people and demonic people, demon possessed people. Jesus does not see all problems as just a matter of demons. He knows that they\u2019re between a physical problem and a spiritual problem. First Timothy, Paul says to Timothy, \u201ctake some wine for your stomach,\u201d which is, you know, medicinal. You\u2019ve got a place in Isaiah 38 where God says, \u201cI\u2019m going to heal you Hezekiah but I want you to put some figs on the boil, and I\u2019ll use medicine in order to do it.\u201d God just didn\u2019t wave his hand and say, okay, you know, I don\u2019t need medicine. I mean, the Bible is just filled with all kinds of reasons to trust science, not scientism, but science. So we ought to push back on the people that are just showing a lack of humility, before a discipline that actually grew up out of Christian soil. But on the other hand, I also want to be sympathetic to the way the use of science to abuse Christians has been\u2026 It has been used. Sorry, that was kind of long, but. Collins: Oh, but it was right on point, Tim. I actually agree with virtually all of that. In fact, one of the motivations for the formation of BioLogos, which is sponsoring this discussion this evening, was to try to counter the sense that the only real voices one could hear about science and faith were on the one hand, the ones you just mentioned who are arguing that science has disproved the need for God and we should just all get over it. And on the other hand, very hard edge fundamentalist views that said, you can\u2019t trust science because it disagrees with my interpretation of this verse or that verse. And most people, I don\u2019t think, really feel very comfortable in those extreme poles, but there wasn\u2019t a lot they could go to in this topic about science and faith. And that is partly why I wrote that book and partly now why BioLogos has come in to sort of occupy, in a wonderful way, that space and make a possibility of civil, loving discourse amongst people trying to sort this out. And it has, I guess, spilled over in the vaccine situation. And it breaks my heart to see why this has become such a nasty situation so often, between people oftentimes quite educated, who have bought into particular conspiracy theories about how vaccines are intended to just make money for pharmaceutical companies and we all know that they\u2019re actually harmful. And the kinds of information that\u2019s spread out there, particularly in social media, that any careful analysis would show is absolutely untrue, but it gets a fire started and it\u2019s very hard to put it out. And it will be very interesting to see, let\u2019s assume we do have a vaccine for COVID-19, maybe as soon as the end of this year, will there be people, even though they have seen others around them suffer and die, who will say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have that vaccine, it\u2019s probably some kind of conspiracy.\u201d I hope and pray that\u2019s not the case. Because this is not one of those things where people have not had their own experience of seeing what the virus can do. Surely you\u2019d want to take advantage of something that could protect you and your loved ones. Stump: This pushes us into perhaps some deeper theological waters here. Collins: Oh good, now Tim\u2019s going to talk more now, I think. Keller: Pressure\u2019s on me. Stump: Both of you are affirming that in times like these, we should be praying for God to help us and we should also be doing our best to develop vaccines and to figure out appropriate treatments. I think our brains are not wired very easily for \u201cboth and\u201d situations like this. For audiences that seemed to think prayer or science. It seems like we have to go one way or the other. How does this work on a practical level? Tim, maybe what\u2019s God doing? We billed this event tonight as Where is God in a Pandemic? Is God sitting waiting for us to ask him to help him to do something to help the scientists figure this out? Or how do we understand God\u2019s action and God\u2019s work in times like this in relationship to our prayers and to our efforts? Keller: Yeah, and by the way, I want you to know that Francis knows a lot more about theology than I know about medicine. So it\u2019s not quite a flip flop here. Well if you ask the question, where is God in the midst of all this, I mean, you have to start very theologically. And that is Christianity presents the only God that actually comes into this world and makes himself vulnerable, mortal, killable, as it were. He experiences weakness and hunger. He experiences physical weakness, injustice, torture and death. And he does this voluntarily, in order to love us, in order to save us. And because it\u2019s Jesus when he rises from the dead and he goes to heaven. You could say, somebody might say, well, sure, he was in the midst of all of our human suffering, but no longer. Except that when he meets Paul, St. Paul, on the road to Damascus, where Paul gets converted, it\u2019s in Acts chapter nine, he says to Paul, \u201cPaul, Paul, why are you persecuting me?\u201d Now, he\u2019d been killing Christians. But he says, \u201cWhy are you persecuting me?\u201d And Paul says, you know, he\u2019s looking at this glorious divine figure saying, \u201chow in the world have I been hurting you?\u201d And obviously, it means that he is present in this world, particularly among his people, in such a way that he is so connected to us that he actually is still in the midst of the suffering. He still is. And therefore when you ask where is God, if you talk about the Christian God in the midst of the pandemic, he\u2019s right here. Okay, I know what people say. Well why did he allow it to happen? In John chapter 11\u2026I preached on this the Sunday after 9\/11, I always go to John 11. Jesus shows up, Lazarus has died, Mary and Martha immediately start asking, basically asking questions, I mean why did you let this happen? First of all, Jesus does not give an explanation. Now we know what it is because of our\u20262000 years later, we\u2019ve got the perspective, we know why Lazarus died. But at that point, Jesus does not give an explanation. What he actually does is he prays, he weeps, he helps, and he does so sacrificially because the thing\u2026 If you read the passage, the moment he raises Lazarus from the dead, the religious leaders decide that\u2019s the final straw, we have to kill him. So Jesus knows he can\u2019t get, he really cannot get Lazarus out of the grave without putting himself in. So he doesn\u2019t give an explanation. He\u2019s just there in the midst. And he prays and he weeps and he helps and he does it sacrificially. And that\u2019s where we got to where we have to be. Now, here\u2019s the thing, when you see Jesus doing that, without giving an explanation, we don\u2019t know why God\u2019s allowing the pandemic right now. We just know it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And he\u2019s got reasons for why he hasn\u2019t stopped suffering yet. We do know, Romans 8 tells us, someday he\u2019s going to stop all sickness and death, everything. We just don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t done it yet. But we do know whatever those reasons are, and he must have good reasons, It\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And we should just be following what Jesus said. We shouldn\u2019t be trying to explain why when people ask, \u201cwhy is God allowing this to happen?\u201d no Christian ought to give a good answer. No Christian ought to say, well because of XYZ. They should pray, help, weep, sacrifice and be right near where everybody else is weeping and suffering. Collins: I think that\u2019s beautifully said. I think the other thing is we have to recognize that this is not the most exceptional moment in all of history, even though it may be in our own lifetime. Sometimes I hear a little bit of that reflection that nothing like this bad has ever happened before. Well, goodness, back through human history we\u2019ve had many plagues. Christians have often been at their best in those plagues, by basically doing things that people around them would not do to try to help those who are suffering. And I hope we\u2019re doing that again, in a way that people recognize, although also we need to keep ourselves safe. So yeah, and read the book of Job for heaven\u2019s sake and see whether you think there\u2019s a guarantee that God\u2019s not going to, at times, allow trouble to happen. It happens to us but he promises to be there for us. I have next to my desk a few scriptures that I have, in the course of this pandemic, pulled out and printed up just so that they were close by when I was having one of those moments. And maybe my favorite of all of them is Psalm 46, which most of you will recognize: \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.\u201d That does not say there will be no trouble. It says, \u201cGod is an ever present help in trouble.\u201d I am really awfully relieved to know that God is here with us in this trouble, each one of us, in ways that can provide comfort and maybe even help us to learn something that we didn\u2019t know before about what humanity is all about and what our calling is, at a time of trouble like this. Keller: Mentioning Job is really helpful, because both Job and Jesus are the two places in the Bible where you see someone who\u2019s an innocent sufferer. Now technically Job being a regular human being isn\u2019t perfectly innocent. Nevertheless, Job didn\u2019t deserve, he didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that suffering. And Jesus when he went to the cross didn\u2019t do anything to deserve his suffering. But because both Job and Jesus were faithful to God without knowing why, but they didn\u2019t turn on God they stayed faithful. Again, Job was shaky. It\u2019s really remarkable to see how shaky he was, but in the end, he holds on. And in both cases, when you experience innocent suffering, and in spite of your questions, you still stay faithful to God, and do what you should do, it defeats Satan. In both cases, Satan is defeated because Satan basically says, \u201coh human beings, they just, they don\u2019t serve you, God, except for themselves. So unless everything is going well in their lives, they\u2019re not going to serve you.\u201d Satan says about Job, \u201cdoes Job serve God for nothing?\u201d Take away things and so what happens in the end if you are suffering even though it\u2019s innocent and you\u2019re faithful to God, you\u2019re defeating Satan. And you\u2019re learning, and you\u2019re also letting the suffering drive you like a nail further into God\u2019s love. And on the other end, you\u2019ll help people and you will actually find that you\u2019re closer to him even though you don\u2019t know the reason why just like Job did not know the reason why. He was never told. So I think Job and Jesus, two innocent sufferers defeating Satan just by being faithful in the darkness is a\u2026.they\u2019re very important models for us. Collins: I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Stump: One more aspect of this I\u2019d like to get you both to comment on is that the suffering seems not to be proportionally spread around in our communities, right? Francis on your NIH Director\u2019s Blog last week, you wrote and interviewed about the disproportionate deaths of minority populations. And I haven\u2019t seen that there\u2019s anything particularly biological to this right? Or is it just a reflection of our societal structures and our systems? And Tim, then I wonder if you might join in about the church and you mentioned Martin Luther\u2019s speech or his letter earlier about how the church may react during these times. Is there anything that the church can do in this particular societal situation we see, where the least of these are suffering more than their fair share in a time like this? Collins: Well, I can certainly say in terms of the bright light that this has shown on the dark situation of health disparities in this country is deeply troubling. We know health disparities are there. People have catalogued them. We know that certain illnesses are more common in people who have less in the way of resources, a lower socioeconomic status and so on. But COVID-19 has been ruthless in the way in which it has attacked those very individuals. In Georgia, where 30% of the population is African American, 80% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 are African American. And it goes along with the health disparities that diabetes and hypertension are more common in those folks. And we haven\u2019t figured out what to do about that. It goes along with the fact that many of those people are not able to go home and stay at home safely, like I am now. Because they\u2019ve got to get out there and make a living, put food on the table. And so they are not being given the chance to protect themselves. And the consequences are devastating. And I don\u2019t think any of us who care about justice and equity and loving your neighbor can look at this situation and not be deeply troubled. And if this is a wake up call for our country and the way in which health abilities and equities are very unfairly distributed, well good for that. Maybe we need to remember this when the COVID-19 pandemic is over. And right now we need to do everything we can to reach out to those communities especially, even more so than those who have more resources. Keller: Francis just went down the list of\u2026there\u2019s multiple reasons why the less economically resourced communities, for tons of reasons, are being harder hit. They live in smaller spaces. They live closer together. They don\u2019t live just in their apartments. They live around their apartments. They can\u2019t work from home. They also have more underlying bad health issues anyway because of their\u2026for various reasons. So he\u2019s gone through the list. You were asking about the church and that\u2019s a big question. Here\u2019s the reason why. Generally, you\u2019ll see that the upper middle class churches, where maybe the majority of the people can work from home, keep their jobs, versus the more blue collar and poor churches where most of the people are out of work, and where there\u2019s a lot more illness and devastation and unemployment in their immediate neighborhood. One of the problems is that the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods will not have the resources to reach out to their neighborhood at all, because like the majority of their own people are unemployed. The church might close up. They can\u2019t pay the light bills. Meanwhile, the churches that are in more, you know, posh and affluent neighborhoods are not going to have near as many needs in their neighborhood. And therefore there needs to be some kind of partnership between churches with more means, Christians with more means, and the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods, if they\u2019re gonna be able to respond. After 9\/11, we knew that something like, I forget now the numbers it was so long ago, something like 17,000 small businesses south of 14th Street, instantly, literally went up in smoke. And there were hundreds of thousands of folks, many of whom were immigrants, who lost their jobs. And Redeemer was able to go into a major mode of helping people who had lost their jobs. Of course we didn\u2019t have the quarantine, we didn\u2019t have the distancing, social distancing, any of that stuff. Nevertheless, it was partly because people actually sent money to Redeemer from across the country, just saying, we\u2019re very concerned about New York, please help. Basically the situation was New York was much more hard hit the rest of the country was not that affected. People knew about Redeemer, sent us the money and we were able to really do it quite a bit. Something like that is going to have to happen, I think, with the more affluent churches with the churches that are in the harder hit communities if they\u2019re really going to respond to this. Stump: Are there mechanisms that you see that are starting to be put in place that might help to facilitate that? Keller: I hear of them. I better not mention any because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m, well\u2026 No, I know there\u2019s a\u2026 The game\u2019s afoot, as Sherlock Holmes would say. There definitely are people working on it. Stump: One more question you might both respond to about the image of God. The image of God is one of the most central doctrines of creation and I wonder how does this bear on our conversation here, both on the value of the least of these who are particularly vulnerable to the disease, but then also with respect to our duties and roles toward our fellow humans and the rest of creation, the image of God in us and how that might be imaged to the rest of the rest of the people. Keller: Francis, go ahead, you first. Collins: Well, you could take that in a bunch of directions, couldn\u2019t you? I guess I\u2019m thinking as you raise the question about this debate about is it okay to take some risks about this pandemic by allowing people to be released from where they have been sequestered and quarantined, even if it means there may be more cases happening as a result. But after all, most of those are perhaps the older people or those with chronic illness, or perhaps somebody in a nursing home or somebody who\u2019s homeless, and maybe that\u2019s a trade off that we should basically except because we need to get our economy going again, Christians should be very careful of that one I think. Yes, the image of God applies to all of us. C.S. Lewis said if you could see any one of those individuals for what they really are as a spiritual creature, you would fall on your knees, even those that we consider the least of them. We of all people ought to be full of compassion and concern for every human being. And to consider that any of those might actually be something a sacrifice would be worth taking. That ought to give us a great deal of trouble. Now, I know I sound like one of those public health people who\u2019s not paying enough attention to the economic damage and I don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s not been horrendous in terms of what it\u2019s done to people\u2019s lives and even caused health issues and even life threatening issues. That\u2019s true too. But let\u2019s be really thoughtful about what we stand for, which is the value of every human life, no matter who it is. Keller: Oh, yeah, listen, I\u2019m just going to build on what Francis said. You know, I think the image of God does stop us from moving into what you might call a hard utilitarianism. Now utilitarianism is a school of ethics, you know, John Stuart Mill, that said, the greatest good for the greatest number. And therefore, if it means sacrificing a smaller number for the good of the whole, that\u2019s fine. Christians can\u2019t go there completely. I mean, when I say\u2026 It seems obvious that if everybody\u2019s in the image of God, then everybody\u2019s in the image of God, including the majority, not just the threatened minority. But nevertheless, it gets you\u2026it does mean that a single life is really very valuable and you really can\u2019t say, you can\u2019t do that hard utilitarianism. A quick example. I know, we probably don\u2019t have time. In 1884\u2014this really happened\u20141884, a British ship called the Mignonette, British, I forget what kind of ship it was, it sunk. There were four survivors and they were in a lifeboat together and they knew that they were not going to be able to survive, probably because they had no food and they were out of the currents, out of the trade winds, unless they were able to, you know, stick it out longer. So three of them killed and ate the fourth guy. Because the fourth guy was an orphan, had no relatives, no parents, no children. He was like 17 or 18 years old. All the others had wives, children, everything. And they sat down in a very utilitarian way, by the way, and said, you know, we\u2019re all going to die, unless he dies, and he doesn\u2019t have any\u2026 You know, basically it was a total utilitarianism. They killed them and ate him. And when they got back, by the way, they went to court and believe it or not the court exonerated them. Because at the time the utilitarian approach to justice was in the ascendancy. I think Christians would say sorry, that was not by his consent, he\u2019s a man in the image of God, has the right not to be killed and eaten. And that\u2019s hard utilitarianism. I still know that there\u2019s a such thing as calculus. Everybody knows, for example, if you shut down all the interstate highways in the country, there\u2019d probably be fewer deaths. And therefore there is some kind of calculus that goes on. It\u2019s at a very high level. But not at the level\u2026I don\u2019t want to do that utilitarianism right now with the virus. So that\u2019s what the image of God does. It does create a bit of a roadblock for people who want to be utilitarian and I would say we can\u2019t go all the way there. Stump: And can you speak at all to the aspect of image of God of people who are in the position to make decisions? What does that mean that we bear the image of God for how we ought to treat people, not just that they themselves are in the image of God, but the duties that are upon us, in times like these. Collins: Well, we are called to be moral creatures, whether we acknowledge that or not, it is a universal sense that all of humanity has. And we recognize there are such things that are good and things that are evil. And it\u2019s a pretty interesting signpost to a creator God who cares about us, by the way. And it is very much on our shoulders to decide how to respond. As we are in the image of God, there\u2019s a lot of weight attached to those decisions. And I know for myself, I fail regularly with those decisions, which then brings me back to why it is a wonderful and amazing and a great comfort that I have Jesus as the Savior, who paid the price for all those times where I don\u2019t live up to the image of God. That makes it possible for me still to be a follower and a believer and to be in relationship with Almighty God, which is an amazing thing to say. Keller: I don\u2019t have anything to add to that. That\u2019s great. Stump: Let\u2019s just close here. We\u2019re going to bring Deb back in. Several of our audience members are even asking how they might pray for the two of you. I think both of you have enormous followings and enormous respect from people that understand the pressures that you\u2019re under. And could you each, maybe just share a couple of specific ways that we could hold you up in prayer and Deb\u2019s gonna pray for us then at the end? Collins: Tim, go ahead. Keller: Well, my part I think, because I\u2019m not the pastor of a church and because I do so many things when it comes to both writing, speaking, mentoring, training, teaching, I\u2019m going to have to replant myself. That is to say I have a lot of leeway as to what I do and I got to have the wisdom to know, in my last years here, because I\u2019m older, what\u2019s the best use of my time? And therefore it\u2019s going to take some wisdom to say what are the new realities and what\u2019s the best way for me to be of service? And actually, I feel quite a burden on that. I don\u2019t feel like I can just chug along do everything I\u2019ve always done. So I would say wisdom to know how to best use my gifts and spend my time in the years I have left. Collins: Wisdom was where I was going too. At a time where there\u2019s so many decisions that have to be made about what\u2019s the right strategy to find answers to this terrible pandemic and I know I\u2019m making mistakes all the time by picking the wrong answer. But I am very fond of that verse from James chapter one, verse 5, \u201cif any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all without reproach, generously, and it will be given.\u201d I am glad that\u2019s the case. Because my wisdom is very insufficient for the challenges we have right now. Haarsma: Well, thank you both for all that you\u2019ve shared with us tonight, and for all of these wise words. And we do want to close here by praying for you, and by praying for all of us in this pandemic. So for every one of you join me in a moment of prayer. Oh Lord, you are the creator. Your love is as big as the universe and you show that amazing love in Jesus Christ. You are the God who became human, who weeps with us and suffers alongside us even to the point of death. Help us to trust that amazing love and stay faithful in the darkness as Job did. Show your love this week to Tim and to Francis. Thank you for their dedication. Keep them safe and healthy. Give them your strength to persevere. And especially give your wisdom as you promised in James, you promised to give wisdom and my ask. Give them wisdom for the urgent challenges of today and the hard decisions for the years to come. Bless each of them as they continue to use their gifts so sacrificially. And Lord we pray you\u2019ll show your immense love to our world. For the sick, bring your healing mercy. Strengthen the health care workers. Guide the researchers. Guide the industry leaders to bring an effective vaccine soon. Into places of sorrow and worry and fear, bring your comfort and presence. Bring your church to show love and compassion. In places of confusion, misinformation and outright lies, bring your truth. Help us to be discerning in how we listen and speak your truth in love. And into places of injustice, where there are not enough resources, where people are suffering more because they\u2019re not able to isolate, bring your church in powerful new ways Lord. May your church be the place that unifies across race and income and geography to care for one another. Show us how to fight for every life, for every community, for every person who bears your image. We continue to pray with Psalm 46, \u201cOh God, you are our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear. Though the earth give way we will not fear and though the mountains fall into the sea, we will not fear because the Lord Almighty is with us.\u201d Jesus Christ weeps alongside us. In your strong name Jesus, we pray. Amen. Collins: Amen, thank you Deb. Keller: Thank you. Collins: Thanks for a wonderful discussion and a conversation, Tim. Keller: Thanks Francis.

        "text":"This event exemplified how Christians and the scientific community can work together to advance God\u2019s purposes and kingdom in the midst of the COVID crisis. Dr. Anderson, a pastor of a large, multicultural church in Maryland, shared some of his congregants\u2019 questions and concerns about the vaccine. Are the vaccines safe? Were people of color represented in the vaccine trials? Are the vaccines derived from aborted fetal tissues? Can you get the vaccine if you are pregnant or nursing? What will our social gatherings be like once we are vaccinated? Practical questions that were answered by the leading scientist in our country, Dr. Collins. As I listened to these Christian men share their knowledge and expertise, I wished that my skeptical friends and family could have watched the live stream with me. I\u2019d love to have the opportunity to ask my friends and family questions about what they heard. Did any of Dr. Collins\u2019 answers resonate with them and alleviate some of their fears or concerns? And if not, what would it take to convince them that the vaccine was safe and effective? In a time where many evangelical Christians do not trust the scientific community, events like this are key to re-establishing that trust. I am thankful for pastors, like Dr. Anderson, who act as bridge builders between the scientific community and their congregations. It takes courage to challenge peoples\u2019 suppositions, even when love is the motivation. I am thankful for Dr. Collins and all of the scientists who contributed to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. God has gifted these men and women with wisdom and intelligence that I am in awe of. And I am thankful for the doctors, nurses, and aids who have been on the frontline of this pandemic, working long hours under extremely stressful situations. God, in his amazing love, has provided us a way out of this pandemic. As I walked into the vaccine center last week to receive my first shot, I thanked him for the gift of this vaccine. Not only was I being provided with protection from this deadly virus, but I was contributing to the health and well-being of those around me. And in a small way, it was my contribution to ending the pandemic.",

        "text":"The vaccine is the key to our global recovery from the pandemic. But currently there exists a sizable number of Christians who have indicated they are suspicious of the vaccine. My name is Curtis Chang, and welcome to Redeeming Babel, where our mission is to provide Biblical thinking in a confusing world. In this series, I want to take seriously the questions that some Christians have about the vaccine. But I want to make the case that after considering those questions, ultimately all Christians should indeed take the vaccine, and do so for important Biblical reasons. There are several questions being asked by Christians. We will examine these questions in our other videos. However, I believe everyone starts with that first question, \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d So this video will focus on vaccine safety. If you can only watch one video, I recommend you too start with this one. So, let\u2019s ask the question: \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d I do believe the vaccine is safe. This is a major reason why I encourage all Christians to take the vaccine. But I think the way this question has gotten framed has unfortunately fallen into the division affecting our country. How the question has been framed In our divided society, each side is doing a great deal of eye rolling at the other side. The \u201cYes\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cNo\u201d side, and dismisses anti-vaxxers as \u201canti-science\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d The \u201cNo\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cYes\u201d side, and dismisses the majority as being \u201cSheeple!\u201d \u201cSheeple\u201d is a term used by some anti-vaxxers to describe people just mindlessly following conventional wisdom like sheep. \u201cThink for yourself!\u201d is the cry of the \u201cNo\u201d side. The way this debate is framed is not accurate or fair to either side. For instance, it really isn\u2019t accurate or fair for the \u201cYes\u201d side to claim their side knows science and the \u201cNo\u201d side is just being ignorant. I\u2019m someone that is on the \u201cYes\u201d side. But if I\u2019m honest with myself, I have to ask, \u201cHow much do I really know the science of the vaccine?\u201d Yes, I\u2019ve read several news articles on the vaccine. But have I really mastered even the basics of the science involved? For instance, could I even name the chemical ingredients of the vaccine? No, I can\u2019t. Could I explain with any scientific detail why the vaccine attacks the virus but is somehow safe for me? If I actually tried, I have about 15 seconds of material and then I start mumbling. I have not read for myself any of the underlying scientific research papers on vaccine safety. And even if I did, I couldn\u2019t understand most of it. If I\u2019m honest, when it comes to the actual science behind vaccine safety, I\u2019m rather, well, \u201cignorant.\u201d So, why do I believe the vaccine is safe? Well, the No side does have a point. It is not because I am \u201cthinking for myself\u201d in the sense that I am not depending on anyone else. In truth, I believe the vaccine is safe because I trust others tasked with answering that question for me. I trust the expert leaders of the scientific institutions like Dr. Francis Collins who heads the National Institute of Health (the NIH). Dr. Collins, by the way, is a devout evangelical Christian and one of the nation\u2019s leading scientists. Here are his words: \u201cAs NIH Director, I\u2019ve followed closely the development of these first vaccines, and I know they have been rigorously tested and found to be safe and effective. I encourage everyone to accept the vaccines when offered to you. It\u2019s our best chance to turn the tide on the pandemic.\u201d I have not \u201cfollowed closely the development of these vaccines.\u201d I do not know the details of this \u201crigorous testing.\u201d But Dr. Collins has, and I am trusting him. And not just him, but all the leading scientific institutions who agree with him on the safety of the vaccine. The FDA, the CDC, and all the major research institutions tasked with knowing about drug safety have assured us that the vaccine is actually very safe. And this overwhelming agreement by experts cuts across political divisions. Bioethics experts from conservative institutions like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Heritage Foundation have all encouraged people to take the vaccine as safe.* In other words, the real question behind \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d is actually the question of trust. The real question is: \u201cDo I trust scientific experts and institutions?\u201d And this means that what is going on for those on the No side is not that they are ignorant, but rather that they distrust the designated experts and institutions. Self-examination for the \u201cNo\u201d side And this is where I invite the \u201cNo\u201d side to do a parallel self-examination. There is a sense on the \u201cNo\u201d side that we are truly independent thinking people who don\u2019t just listen to the authorities tell us how to think. Rather we \u201cthink for ourselves.\u201d But do we? Do any of us actually \u201cthink for ourselves\u201d in a consistent and complete way? When we go to McDonald\u2019s and order a Big Mac, are we inspecting for ourselves whether that particular piece of hamburger comes from healthy cattle, that it has been slaughtered in a sanitary fashion, that it didn\u2019t get contaminated somewhere in the long supply chain? Of course not. Every day, we are willing to inject many things into our own bodies because we trust the underlying institutions that have been tasked with knowing these things for us. We trust not just McDonalds, but a whole system of institutions behind it: its supply chain, government inspectors, the cattle industry, and many, many experts and institutions. Every day, we are all trusting in others. None of us fully \u201cthinks for ourselves.\u201d And here is the key Biblical truth that I want to emphasize: that is a good thing. That is the way God designed human beings and human life to operate. God designed us to navigate the world through trusting others, including trusting institutions and experts. Think about the Old Testament. Yes, some rare individuals get direct access to God\u2019s truth. But the vast majority of people in the Bible have to trust designated leaders: prophets, priests, kings. People have to trust entire institutions like the system of judges Moses appoints, the Levites, the Temple. In the New Testament, Jesus\u2019 all important Great Commission rests on his expectation that the entire world will trust the words of the few he has designated. God has designed human knowledge to access truth about the world through trust. Why did God design human life in the world to operate this way? I suspect God did this as a way to build our trust muscles for ultimately trusting Him. If a person insists on being distrustful of everything and everybody, that person will become a fundamentally distrustful person. A fundamentally distrustful person will have difficulty trusting God. So, trusting in other human institutions is like faith training, building up our trust muscles for God. Of course, trusting human institutions does not mean expecting them to be perfect. Human institutions, like human individuals, have flaws. But just like we have to figure out how to trust imperfect individuals in our lives \u2013 like our spouses, our parents, our friends \u2013 and we also have to learn to trust imperfect human institutions. If you lean on the \u201cNo\u201d side of the vaccine debate, I want to point out that you\u2019ve already learned to trust the very institutions that are telling you the vaccine is safe. Every time you buy some aspirin at the drugstore, you are trusting the FDA who oversees all drug safety. This is the same institution that has approved the COVID vaccine. Every time, you take a family member to the ER at your local hospital, you are trusting the NIH, the institution headed by Francis Collins who oversees health practices. You already trust these institutions for yourself and your loved ones. Please keep trusting them as they tell you that the vaccine is safe. The coronavirus has disrupted our world, caused enormous suffering of all kinds, and killed over 2 million people globally, and over 400,000 Americans. The vaccine is our best chance at ending this suffering and preventing more deaths. But the vaccine does not have all the ingredients necessary to accomplish this. It needs one ingredient that only you can supply: this is the ingredient of trust. Let\u2019s add our part to the solution. *Additional institutions in support of the vaccine include The Center for Bioethics & Human Dignity of Trinity International University, Pontifical Academy for Life, American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians; Catholic Medical Association, and Christian Medical & Dental Associations.",

        "title":"Can COVID Cause Brain Damage?",
        "link":"https:\/\/prevention.com\/health\/a39371527\/covid-brain-damage\/",
        "text":"Three years into the global COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are still learning more about how the virus impacts the body. Now, there\u2019s a new finding: COVID-19 is linked to brain damage. That\u2019s the major takeaway from a new study published in the journal . For the study, researchers analyzed data from 401 patients aged 51 to 81 who underwent brain scans before they contracted COVID-19 and months after they were infected. Their scans, which were conducted about three years apart, were compared to those of 384 people who weren\u2019t infected with COVID-19, but had similar characteristics like age, sex, medical history, and socioeconomic status to those who did contract the virus. The researchers noted that it\u2019s normal to lose some gray matter each year, which helps control movement, memory, and emotions. But patients who had COVID-19\u2014who had a second brain scan about 4.5 months after they were infected\u2014had more gray matter loss than those who didn\u2019t have the virus, losing between 0.2 and 2% extra gray matter in different brain regions between their two scans. They also lost more brain volume and showed more tissue damage in certain areas, including those linked to the sense of smell, than those who never had the virus. Most of the study participants were never hospitalized with COVID-19 (only 15 of them were), and the researchers noted that the trend in brain changes was still seen when the hospitalized patients were excluded from the findings. Whether you\u2019ve had COVID-19, love someone who has had the virus, or are just curious, it\u2019s understandable to have questions about what\u2019s going on. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why might COVID-19 cause brain damage? It\u2019s not entirely clear, but the researchers said in an FAQ they shared online that it seems to linked to loss of smell. \u201cIt is known that areas of the brain that are not being used can atrophy, so it will be important to understand how much of this may be related to loss of smell,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who did not work on the study. \u201cAnother explanation could be the effect of the virus itself, either because it invades the brain, or because it causes inflammation or immune reactions,\u201d the researchers wrote. However, they added, \u201cit is still unclear why such invasion or inflammatory\/immune reactions should be mainly seen in specific regions of the brain, but not others.\u201d What kind of symptoms can people experience from this? The researchers didn\u2019t explore this. However, they did have study participants take cognitive tests around attention and efficiency in doing something complex. That showed that, on average, there was \u201clarger cognitive decline\u201d in people who were infected than those who were not infected, the researchers wrote. \u201cWhen you have inflammation in the brain from whatever cause, it can cause symptoms,\u201d says Santosh Kesari, M.D., Ph.D., neurologist at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and regional medical director for the Research Clinical Institute of Providence Southern California. But Dr. Kesari says it\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d to see changes in brain matter volume after having a virus. That, he says, \u201cmeans there's a pretty severe inflammation going on.\u201d The actual symptoms depend on the area of the brain that\u2019s impacted, he says. But, given that this seems to be tied to areas of the brain that are linked to smell and taste, Dr. Kesari says it makes sense that the loss or change of these senses would be symptoms. Amit Sachdev, M.D., M.S., medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University, agrees and says that this can have big implications for people. \u201cSmell is important for taste and for threat recognition,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout smell, food can be very bland. Also, some safety measures that use smell to alert for a problem won\u2019t work. The most commonly cited example is being able to smell the \u2018rotten egg\u2019 smell added to natural gas. If you can't smell, you might not be able to detect a natural gas leak.\u201d Can COVID cause other neurological disorders? This is still being explored. However, Dr. Adalja points out that COVID-19 has been linked to a few other neurological health conditions, including: New loss of taste and smell Strokes Peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness, and pain from nerve damage) Guillain-Barre Syndrome (an autoimmune disorder where a person's immune system damages the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis) Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain that can be caused by a virus or bacteria) Fatigue and body tingling can also happen as a result of COVID-19, Dr. Sachdev says, adding, \u201cwe have seen many patients with these long-term complications.\u201d How long does COVID-19 affect the brain? That\u2019s also unclear. The researchers noted that they have no clue how long these brain changes will last. \u201cWhether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow up,\u201d they wrote. But it\u2019s possible that people can regain at least some of their brain health over time. \u201cOnce damaged, the brain can recover but the recovery tends to be incomplete,\u201d Dr. Sachdev says. \u201cBrain injury is permanent. The area that is damaged can't regrow.\" Still, he says, \u201cbrain plasticity allows for some recovery.\u201d Dr. Sachdev says that it\u2019s possible that people can regain their sense of smell afterward \u201cbut that smell might not be the same as before the infection.\u201d If you\u2019re still having unusual symptoms after having COVID-19, Dr. Kesari recommends seeing your doctor for an evaluation. But, he points out, doctors are still learning more about the after-effects of having COVID-19. \u201cThere is further work that needs to be done,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be additional treatments to help the brain recover better, but we need more research.\u201d This article is accurate as of press time.

But given what has happened over the last few years through the decision making of government, is how a good time to stop paying attention? This is a tough question, because in many ways it\u2019s healthy to know when to say enough, but when the stakes are as high as they are now, surely we have to stay in the game no? My Guests today are Dr Madhava Setty and David Helfrich. Madhava is a physician who has been actively engeged in examining and reporting on COVID related literature since the onset of the pandemic, and David is a lawyer who has been curiously reflecting on the nature of COVID restrictions and their affect on rights, as well as much of COVID literature in general. We\u2019ll talk about COVID news fatigue, the value of information, some key takeaways we must consider when looking at the COVID era, and as always we\u2019ll get into a deeper set of philosophical and metaphysical questions asking whether COVID has applied an evolutionary pressure for the consciousness of humanity.

        "text":"Print this article TTAC is experiencing heavy censorship on many social media channels since we\u2019ve been targeted by the mainstream media sellouts, social media bullies, and political turncoats. Be sure to get the TRUTH by subscribing to our email list. It\u2019s free. Editor\u2019s Note: This article was originally published in the August 2022 edition of the TTAC Insiders Newsletter. I am honored to have the opportunity to contribute to TTAC\u2019s important work. I have benefited personally from TTAC\u2019s work on cancer, vaccines, and propaganda. Given my family history of vaccine injury, COVID and its hyped \u201cvaccines\u201d did not come as a shock. It was not hard to see that rushed experimental vaccines, with even less liability than licensed vaccines, were a disaster in the making. I knew about the horrific side effects and illnesses associated with vaccines\u2014the corrupt practices between regulators and industry\u2014and the fact that the corporate media and medical system would do the captive regulators\u2019 bidding. But there were major new wrinkles in the last two years. We\u2019d never seen such pervasive mandates by employers, schools, theaters, and restaurants\u2014particularly mandates of an emergency use authorized product that cannot be compelled under federal law. We\u2019d never seen such a media blitz\u2014not even the H1N1 swine flu or measles scares compared. And I\u2019d never heard such extraordinary lies about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, about the dangers of alternatives like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, about the numbers of cases and deaths, about the benefits of lockdowns, masks and testing. Even for those like myself who had been in the health freedom movement for years, the COVID nightmare was remarkable for its sheer enormity: the globally coordinated efforts to induce the whole global population to participate in a medical experiment. Although I considered myself reasonably well educated about vaccines before March 2020, having co-authored two books and many articles, my learning curve since then has been steep. I had not appreciated just how deeply involved governments worldwide had become in establishing a new biosecurity paradigm and how assiduously they had rehearsed pandemic exercises for decades. After watching Event 201, the coronavirus rehearsal that took place in October 2019, I learned that this was but one of a series of tabletop exercises for global leaders where the conclusion to solving a medical emergency always ended in the loss of human rights. Professor Paul Schreyer\u2019s video Pandemic Simulation Games\u2014Preparation for a new era? on the history of these simulation exercises was a revelation. Similarly, although I had learned something about ID 2020 and the desire to track every person on the planet, I had not appreciated the critical intersections between digital IDs or vaccine passports, central bank digital currencies, the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGreat Reset\u201d and social credit scoring. James Corbett, Catherine Austin Fitts, Truthstream Media, John Titus, Corey\u2019s Digs, and others helped me piece together these parts of the puzzle. Working on CHD Films and Andy Wakefield\u2019s recent documentary, Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda, forced me to accept as a fact that the World Health Organization and parts of the U.S. government have been working on a depopulation agenda in the developing world for decades. As this vivid film depicts, the WHO designed and developed a vaccine to cause infertility in women under the guise of a tetanus vaccine and deceitfully deployed it in Kenya and elsewhere to sterilize women without their knowledge or consent. Forced sterilization, which the WHO clearly undertook, is a war crime under the treaty for the International Criminal Court. And now we are seeing a staggering death toll from the COVID shots emerge from scientific articles, VAERS data, insurance data, and reports of sudden unexplained deaths. This is a dystopia in real life. We are living a nightmare that global leaders taunt is far from over. President Biden says \u201cthere\u2019s going to be another pandemic.\u201d Likewise, WHO Director-General Tedros warns that the next plague could occur very soon. And the WHO, with the U.S. in the lead, is attempting to create a treaty giving itself unimaginable powers to declare and police pandemics worldwide as the fulcrum for a new global order. And yet\u2026the COVID paradigm is a bridge too far. Humans who want to stay human vastly outnumber the predatory cabal bent on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with its blurring of the lines between human and machine, artificial intelligence, and the promise of a new global order with truncated individual rights. Make no mistake, despite all the bluster and ballyhoo, the predatory regime is crumbling: The U.S. government is throwing out unused stocks of COVID shots, 70% of U.S. citizens are not following CDC guidance to get all their shots and boosters, by any mainstream media definition this would make 70% of Americans anti-vaxxers; and only 18% of parents polled say they plan to give their children under 5 the shot. It\u2019s becoming clear that the shots don\u2019t work but rather kill and maim people. America\u2019s doctor himself, Dr. Fauci, got sick with COVID after 2 doses, 2 boosters, and Pfizer\u2019s patented Paxlovid. And despite the remarkable suppression of information about COVID deaths and injuries in the media, people talk; people see and hear their neighbors and family members speak about illness and death after COVID shots. As President Lincoln famously said, \u201cYou can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can\u2019t fool all of the people all of the time.\u201d Trying to use this playbook a second time for \u201cthe next pandemic\u201d\u2014monkeypox or another infectious disease\u2014is simply a collapsed bridge. It won\u2019t work. While the same kinds of calamities have been occurring worldwide in the childhood vaccine program for decades, they were on a smaller scale; they didn\u2019t affect everyone around the globe all at once. Instead, those injured were isolated and gaslighted, the media disparaged and ridiculed the families, and the courts were closed. But now, billions have been directly and simultaneously affected by this man-made catastrophe. People are talking on social media, at rallies, at family gatherings, and in growing organizations like CHD. And even the mainstream media is starting to talk about vaccine injury, cautiously, but it is acknowledging injuries and deaths and the fact that there is no functioning compensation system for those harmed. And although there have been few grand slams, courts around the world are open and hearing cases related to vaccines\u2014the mandates, the exemptions, the suppression of treatments, the ingredients\u2014more than ever before. A few of the legal victories to date include: A Supreme Court decision to invalidate the mandate for companies with over 100 employees A Supreme Court decision to invalidate the CDC\u2019s suspension of housing evictions A Florida federal court\u2019s decision to lift the mask mandate in transportation A Texas federal court\u2019s decision to require Pfizer to release the documents it provided to the FDA for licensure of its COVID injection The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision to lift the COVID mandate for federal workers pending a hearing of the full panel of 17 judges An injunction against Washington, D.C. Minor Consent Act, allowing children as young as 11 to \u201cconsent\u201d to COVID and other vaccinations without parental knowledge or consent The Louisiana Governor\u2019s retraction of a school COVID mandate in light of pending litigation An Indian Supreme Court decision holding that the COVID shot may not be mandated An Uruguayan court\u2019s decision to withhold all COVID vaccines from children unless Pfizer answers tough questions and produces material documents An Austrian court\u2019s requirement that the Health Minister answer tough questions about a universal COVID mandate, which led to the mandate being shelved, among others During the last two years, I\u2019ve learned that courts follow culture. Judges are a cautious lot. Even when the law would permit them to make bold decisions against the government or corporate actors, they are often reluctant to do so. But as culture fast approaches the tipping point to say \u201cWe will not take this anymore!\u201d, judges are becoming bolder. I expect we will see more judicial decisions finding that government actors\u2014the FDA, CDC, NIH, Governors, and Mayors\u2014have exceeded their authority. We\u2019ll see more revelations about pharma fraud and government collusion. We\u2019ll see more winning cases on religious exemptions and mandates, as consensus science now acknowledges that the shots do not stop transmission or infection thus eliminating any legitimate rationale for mandates. If there is a change in control in the House of Representatives in January 2023, as is usually the case in midterm elections, we could see serious hearings about what has gone down since March 2020, and we could learn who knew what and when. We could see Congress lead investigations using its subpoena power. These hearings could culminate after a few years in tectonic political shifts, leading to legislative changes to end pharma\u2019s blanket liability protection, end conflicts of interest between industry and the FDA, CDC, and NIH; end direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, and end usurious drug prices and taxpayer-funded pharma disasters. In short, with the sea change in public opinion that is likely in the next two years, massive changes await. Children\u2019s Health Defense is at the heart of the global effort to create the parallel world we will need as the existing power structures fail. With activities in science, education, advocacy, and litigation in CHD chapters around the world, we are creating the change we want to see; and shining a bright light on what\u2019s not working brings us hope to fix what\u2019s broken. Klaus Schwab recently told his buddies at the Davos 2022 Summit \u201cThe future is built by us.\u201d No, Mr. Schwab, the World Economic Forum does not build the future; we the people worldwide build the future.",

They are both recovering in the hospital and doing well. Please keep them both in your prayers as they continue to recover and heal. Carrie has been a good friend to us and is a hero in the world sounding the alarm about the COVID shots and the transhumanism agenda the globalists are rolling out without our express knowledge through the COVID shot. If it weren\u2019t for Dr Carrie and others like her, we would be in the dark about the science and ingredients and their very dangerous effects on the human body. Thank you, Carrie, for your service to humanity. Please enjoy this video presentation of Dr Carrie Madej speaking at our most recent TTAC Live Event 2021 in Nashville, Tn where she talks about \u201cThe COVID-19 Injections \u2013 A Gateway to Transhumanism?\u201d VIDEO TRANSCRIPT Ty Bollinger: Our afternoon keynote speaker was originally from Dearborn, Michigan. She received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences. She then completed her traditional internship at The Medical Center in Columbus, Georgia, and internal medicine residency at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. She served as a private clinician and medical director of multiple clinics in Georgia till 2015, also served as an attending physician for the Pennsylvania College of Osteopathic Medicine. Charlene Bollinger: She has served as a public speaker and has been featured in the documentary The Marketing of Madness about the overuse of prescriptions psychotropic medicines, and she has now dedicated her life in educating others about vaccine, nanotechnology, and human rights. She\u2019s become a good friend. I\u2019ve spoken with her on a few different occasions. She\u2019s a dear, dear soul, and I personally am looking forward to hearing our good friend, Dr. Carrie Madej. Ty Bollinger: Give it up for Carrie Madej. Dr. Carrie Madej: Thank you so much. It\u2019s so exciting for me to be here today. I\u2019m going to talk about obviously some ugly things that are happening in our world, but remember that we need to be wise as serpents and gentle as doves. And people get scared of the word apocalypse, right? But we shouldn\u2019t because literally the word apocalypse means lifting of the veil. We are seeing now what has been unseen. These ugly things that are going on right now are for a purpose. It is for us to finally remember who we are and what we are. It really is about returning back to who we are, which is we have a royal birthright, a divinity right with God, Yeshua, our savior. Dr. Carrie Madej: So, transhumanism. If you don\u2019t know this word, you need to know it. Everybody in the world should know this because it is my belief that these injections they falsely call vaccines are the gateway to transhumanism and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going through this chaos. You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, right? So let\u2019s get started. Dr. Carrie Madej: The most important question you should ever ask yourself is what does it mean to be human? Because right now, the future of humankind is at stake. They want to turn us into something called human 2.0, and I personally am against it. So you need to know what is going on. So Ray Kurzweil, he\u2019s one of the big wigs of Google, he\u2019s a transhumanist. He says, we are all, not just a couple of people, we are all going to be a hybrid. This is the most pivotal point in human history. We are alive for this time. And I know I was born here to be for this moment, weren\u2019t you? Dr. Carrie Madej: So, transhumanism. What is that? That is literally the melding of artificial intelligence with the human body. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but it\u2019s doable and possible if we allow it to happen. It\u2019s also about manipulating the human genetics, that God-given code. So just so you know how precious your genome is, it is in one person, if you unraveled it, it would extend out to 10 billion miles, one human being. That is a wonderful living language. You can read it like a book. It can actually be read as a binary code. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so people now in this transhumanist field, they believe that the human body is broken and fragile. We\u2019re going to fix that. We\u2019re going to take evolving humanity into our own hands. These people right now think that and they are executing their plan. So this says scientists propose putting nanobots in our bodies to create a global super brain. Isn\u2019t it selling something from the worst sci-fi movie ever? We\u2019re living it right now, guys. So you can\u2019t get distracted by what the television is telling you. It\u2019s tell a vision. It\u2019s programming you. Turn it off, never turn it back on again and you will become smarter already. Dr. Carrie Madej: So again, Ray Kurzweil, we all know this man. He says, we\u2019re just a few breakthroughs from achieving eternal life. Again, what these people are doing, listen, they are atheists. They do not believe in God our Father in heaven. They will tell you that. Even Ray Kurzweil says, somebody asked him, \u201cIs there a God?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but soon there will be one.\u201d Craig Venter, another transhumanist, they asked him, \u201cWhat is God?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, God creates. Now, I can create, we can create. Now we\u2019re gods.\u201d You need to know those are the pushers of this agenda. They are the pushers of these injections falsely called vaccines. Dr. Carrie Madej: So you have to know what they plan. They have a plan for human bodies as you can see here, avatar A, B, C, D. So this is an evolution of going up to 2045. They actually kind of pushed this agenda to 2030, eight years from now, guys. So they want to actually\u2026 They think a human being is only memories and dreams. That\u2019s it. Because again, they don\u2019t believe in God. So they think if they upload all of our memories and dreams into the cloud, then they can download them into a new body or robots or a digital avatar like a video game. You have to know what they\u2019re thinking. I know it sounds ludicrous, but you need to know. Dr. Carrie Madej: So who else is behind this? World Economic Forum, Davos. And if you really want to know what they\u2019re planning, look at the World Economic Forum\u2019s websites. So this is what they\u2019ll tell all of us that 2030 is their goal, guys. So in 2030, it says the average human will own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better, right? They also say on the bottom paragraph here, they\u2019re giving you the description of now, this is their best sell. They\u2019re marketing this to you, okay? They say that in the future, everywhere you go will be registered, there\u2019s no privacy, and every thought and every dream is recorded and monitored. And you hope that none of those dreams, none of those thoughts go against the narrative or you\u2019re in trouble. You will be in trouble for what you dream of. These are these megalomaniacs behind this plan. They plan this for the future of humankind. Dr. Carrie Madej: So these are very outrageous ideas. So how in the world could they accomplish this really almost eight years now? So you have to know about DARPA. Very important organization to know, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They\u2019re the black ops, the sci-fi kind of portion of the Pentagon. They have public and private funding. And so one of the things you need to know is this substance called hydrogel. Hydrogel is like the mother kind of formula. It\u2019s a sci-fi substance that can do many things. Actually it\u2019s very analogous to the human tissue. So we usually don\u2019t reject it in the body. It can assemble, disassemble, reassemble innumerable times. It can make more of itself in your body. It can meld with the human tissue and be a hybrid with your body, your brain, and your nervous tissue. They\u2019ve used it in military projects already. Dr. Carrie Madej: So just so you know, an example of that would be, there is a small group of Black Hawk helicopter. It was a project. And when they sat in the aircraft, they\u2019d have to wear a magnetic helmet. And at that moment, all their eye movements and everything they thought, the aircraft would know immediately to do in respond. The aircraft and the person, the pilot was one. And if they had an upgrade, they didn\u2019t have to study. They just sat in the cockpit and then it was downloaded into their brain. They\u2019ve been doing this for decades. So Neil deGrasse Tyson, he\u2019s an astrophysicist, is talking to Ray Kurzweil, the guy we\u2019ve been talking about. So listen to what he says. Neil deGrasse Tyson: In 20 years, plus or minus, and so the mid 2030s, we will have nanobots that we can feed into our brain that directly connect to the cloud rather than through anything we carry in our pocket. And in that way, wirelessly, we can basically download entire books, entire languages, and we will then know the\u2026 Dr. Carrie Madej: I\u2019m sorry. All right. Sorry, that cut off a little early, but you\u2019re talking about nanobots. So hydrogel, that magical substance can form nanobots. It can be a drug delivery system. It can be biosensor. It can be a biosensor in your body. So how in the world could they get nanobots in our body? How could they upload everything? How could they know our thoughts? How could they know our dreams? How could they monitor everything? How could this happen? Because they\u2019re doing it right now through these injections falsely called vaccines and they\u2019ve been lying to us from the beginning. Dr. Carrie Madej: So it is not a vaccine. Never call it a vaccine ever again any of these shots they\u2019re giving to anybody, all right? It\u2019s a brand new technology on the human race. It\u2019s nothing like an old vaccine. Old vaccine takes the actual virus and it\u2019s dead or alive with some toxins, puts it in your body, and your body\u2019s supposed to know how to fight it just a little bit amount, right? No, there is no virus at all that they have documented. There\u2019s over 70 freedom of information acts. Do you know we don\u2019t have the virus on file anywhere in the world? Nobody has it in their lab. This is a little crazy, right? So they couldn\u2019t make the normal way. They had to make a Frankenstein code so that your body produces this. They took proteins, they took this genetic code and mashed it together and had an artificial intelligence program fill in the missing gaps. So it\u2019s artificial intelligence, a synthetic thing that\u2019s not from nature and different kinds of parts of genetic material pushed into one and they are programming your body to make it like a factory. Dr. Carrie Madej: What\u2019s in the code? We know a little bit. We know that there\u2019s a human protein similar to the body so your body potentially could start attacking itself. It\u2019s so similar. Like autoimmune disorders. HIV-1, did anyone know that? Is that informed consent here? 18 sub-units of HIV-1 are in that code that your body will be producing. What will that do? Chromosome 8 is pretty important. It\u2019s in charge of intelligence and fertility. It\u2019s a potential damaging that. Most important, they\u2019re putting a fake amino acid in your body, not from this world. That beautiful symphony orchestra of how your body is created with that genome that twist and turns, it\u2019s beautiful from God, they\u2019re destroying it with a fake protein. It\u2019s like origami. It won\u2019t twist and fold together again. Dr. Carrie Madej: This guy you need to know, Dr. Craig Venter. Never forget that name. This man is behind this transhumanist movement. He\u2019s the brains behind it. And I want you to know that if we have a synthetic gene, which this vaccine has\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, injection has synthetic genes in it, if it gets taken up into our human genome, that\u2019s bad because in 2013 in this country, the Supreme Court justice has ruled that any human being can be patented and owned if there\u2019s a synthetic gene inside of them. What? Did you know that? Was that on your CNN, your Fox News? No. Literally overnight, you can be patented and owned. This guy is partly responsible for this. Dr. Carrie Madej: So they didn\u2019t want you to know there was a synthetic gene inside this injection because it\u2019s possible for it to take up into your body. And if it\u2019s taken up, they decided to get credit for their work. They\u2019re so proud of this. Again, they think they\u2019re little creators. They\u2019re gods, right? So they\u2019re putting their names branding you like a cow. 46 scientists are doing this. They\u2019re getting a secret email inside the genome. I guess that\u2019s who you belong to if someone finds you. Also three messages. Can\u2019t figure out those messages yet. Working on that. And also a brand new alphabet. Why alphabet? Dr. Carrie Madej: Remember they want to be gods or copying God, but it\u2019s a blasphemy, an inversion of God, okay? They want you to live forever. They want you to always be connected through a hive mind. And also we\u2019re connected with God, right? So frequencies. Like you\u2019re tuning on a radio, they want to switch the channel. They want to switch the station because words are powerful. Remember in the beginning there was the word. Yeah. It\u2019s powerful, guys. See what they\u2019re doing? We know what they\u2019re doing, right? So they\u2019re not going to get away with it. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so this is going back to, yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that a human being can be patented and owned if this synthetic gene gets taken up into your body. And they\u2019re telling us it can\u2019t happen. Absolutely it can happen. They\u2019re lying to you. Absolutely. Right here, this is the modified messenger RNA that they\u2019re using inside of these injections, and this is just one of many research articles showing that our body has the potential to use reverse transcriptase enzyme. Long word. It can take it up into the genome of our genome and then it becomes permanent. It\u2019s a Russian roulette. It\u2019s a chance. It\u2019s like playing Craps. We shouldn\u2019t be doing that with our sovereignty, with our human holy temple, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So Moderna and Pfizer. So everybody tells me, \u201cOkay, I know some of those injections are bad. Okay. Well, what about this one? What about this one?\u201d No, they\u2019re all bad, guys. They\u2019re all putting a fake code inside of your body. Something not from nature that you are producing like a factory. And you know how they\u2019re doing that? They have to suppress your immune checkpoints. They have to suppress your immune system so your body accepts it. For how long will that happen? That means more cancers, more autoimmune disorders, all kinds of things. Do you think they cared? No. They just want their drug inside of your body. Dr. Carrie Madej: They also are putting artificial intelligence inside your body. Unbelievable. But it\u2019s just to get the drug delivery system in. So the hydrogel is part of this artificial intelligence system. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re not going to use it for bios and we\u2019re not going to do it to spy on you. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re just going to put it inside your body just for the drug delivery. But once it\u2019s in your body, don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t use it for anything else.\u201d Do you believe that? They are liars. They lied from the beginning. We know by Dr. David Martin that\u2026 We know where the coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, came from, right? It\u2019s patented 2002. There\u2019s a patent. That means it was made in a lab. Someone\u2019s making money off of it. We know where it came from. It\u2019s not from some bat soup shop, whatever, in China. It\u2019s a lie. Dr. Carrie Madej: So all of them are the same. Some of them say they\u2019re doing different things. Sometimes they\u2019re using a vector. Vector means they\u2019re using a cold virus that is infecting you purposely and then it\u2019ll inject this genetic material inside of you. Some are just using the hydrogel, right? They\u2019re telling us they\u2019re doing different ways. And I knew this, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I don\u2019t trust them, right? And I\u2019ll show you some photos. So Moderna also says that it\u2019s trying to put an operating system inside of you. An operating system just like Windows. We know Windows is terrible. Viruses all the time, right? They messed up on that. How are they going to make this one good? Impossible. And were you given informed consent? Have they told us about this? No. They\u2019re liars. Again, this is the theme. They\u2019re lying. Satan is the greatest of deceivers, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So with this hydrogel, different things come under hydrogel, nanobots, graphing, magnetic particles, et cetera. But that\u2019s the mother of all of that substance. And just to FYI, hydrogel is the opposite of water life. We\u2019re over 90% water. Water gives life. It freezes when it\u2019s not supposed to freeze. When it freezes, it expands instead of condenses, something very strange. It boils when it\u2019s not supposed to boil. It makes different crystal structures depending on intention, where it comes from. It\u2019s beautiful. It has intelligence in life. Water\u2019s life. Hydrogel is water gel. It sucks the life out. It literally will dry out the water. That is not healthy for any human body. And they want to put nanobots inside of you just like this. Dr. Carrie Madej: And how could they do that? Well, one little syringe needle, one little syringe needle, 1 million can fit in there. And this is one of the symbols of hydrogel. You want to see how it moves inside? This could be assembling, disassembling, reassembling in your body to do innumerable tasks, do innumerable things. I want to show you another nanobot. This is called a TRAP bot, okay? I actually have seen images of this in the vial, somebody whose vials we\u2019re injecting into people. Speaker 5: Organization-based microrobots or TRAP bots which can capture and transport live cells to a desired location. Much like a spider weaving a web, these microbots can spit out thread-like gel to trap living cells and incorporate them in their hollow microcylinder. This microcylinder is about 200 micrometers in diameter. It also contains the ingredients for these cell trapping gel, which creates a long thread-like structure while [inaudible 00:19:17] allows for magnetic- Dr. Carrie Madej: Okay. So this is just giving you an example of how it can move through the body and what is directing the movement? A magnet or magnet force, a magnetic force. And it\u2019s very minuscule, but I don\u2019t know if you noticed what they\u2019re saying. There\u2019s a long string-like, hair-like substances gel, hydrogel, coming from it that builds, it can actually build and grow as it\u2019s squirming through the body. Hydrogel is also important to know because it can create its own electricity, okay? Think about to build a computer, you need some power. You need electricity. So we are powerful beings, A, and now the hydrogel can produce its own electricity. But remember computers when you have a laptop on your lap and it\u2019s been working for a while, it gets really hot. They have to cool down. So the problem is when something is generating a lot of computing power, how do we cool it down? Oh, don\u2019t worry. Hydrogel can cool itself down. They\u2019ve already thought about this. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, hydrogel in a injection with Moderna, Pfizer, et cetera, they\u2019re calling it nanolipid particle. So nanolipid particle is a creative way of saying the same word as hydrogel just so you know. Again, DARPA has their clarity project with hydrogel, and what they\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re so good at it when they inject it into the human body in some of their military experiments, they were able to mold it and make it a hybrid tissue with the brain and the nervous system of the military victim. And so when they did that, they could see through and feel and know what that soldier is thinking like an avatar. Use them as computer simulation game. And they think this is great. So this guy you need to know, he\u2019ll explain about the technology. Speaker 6: [crosstalk 00:21:23] the sensory cortex of the second animal and that animal acquires the knowledge. From the human drone technology standpoint, you can attach the human brain to another human brain, you can direct motor activity, or you can send communication and information. Dr. Venter\u2019s work is in my view, the equivalent of the development of nuclear weapons when you realize that he created life in a cell. He programmed yeast cells to produce anything he wanted. These can be inserted into you through the hypospray needles. You put in a specific gene slicing, you program what you like, you put it in the cell and it can reproduce and make as much as you like. It sends a signal and it tells which portion of the DNA should unwrap, unfold, and produce a product. Speaker 6: Related to this is an idea called DREADDs. These are designer receptors that can be remotely controlled. You can create a cell, you can put it somewhere in the body and you can remotely activate it. So you have the capacity to create any product as long as you know the DNA sequence, you can insert it into a living system and you can remotely control it. That may affect the way you think, the way you act. So once you know that the technology is there to edit, splice, and program the cell and the technology currently exists to administer to somebody and have it go park anywhere you program it to go park proliferate and do its function, you can have things activated in other people\u2019s brains. Speaker 6: These people have figured out how to hide imagery in the DNA of bacteria. You can have the information reproduced in a string form as a form of a protein. The new way to hide information is going to be in DNA. This is the first experiment showing what imagery you can hide in bacteria. This is the latest. It\u2019s a GIF file. Well, this is what the Chinese are doing with DNA. Merging DNA systems with quantum computing will be really quite an amazing and both lethal threat. The next thing I wanted to mention to you is memory. Can we erase memory? Can we modify memory? Can we change memory? Of course the short answer is yes. Dr. Carrie Madej: So I want you to know the brief thing of this this guy works with is bioweapons with this kind of nanotechnology. And he\u2019s saying what they can is do this kind of substance like the hydrogel, okay? And they can use it for multiple purposes. They\u2019re so good at it with these nanobots. They can rewrite your memory. They can erase your memory, put a new memory inside of you. If you have this substance inside of you that they could do all these things, do you trust them when they say it\u2019s just a drug delivery system. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t trust them at all. They can make new memories. They can send an impulse into the body and make you feel something, make a toxin produced, make a neuropeptide produced. There\u2019s no good thing. There\u2019s no God-given reason why anybody would do that to another human. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, you might\u2019ve seen this, patent 2020\/060606. Do you think they picked 666 by accident? People have marketing departments, I know, and they know that we have a visceral reaction to 666. We have a contact tracing act, 6666, right? Moderna has ingredients with a number 0.666 or 6.666. This is not accident guys. Symbolism is everywhere. Pay attention. They use symbolism and they will tell you who they serve. And here they\u2019re showing the person as a little tiny speck, that\u2019s you or me, and then there\u2019s a device, which is your cell phone or my cell phone, and then you are wirelessly connected to your cell phone. How does that happen? They have to have a substance inside of you to make you wirelessly connected to everything. It\u2019s called the internet of bodies, the internet of things. And so how do they do that? You have to ask yourself. They want to do it by 2030. They have to make you a walking Wi-Fi electronic device. They can do it with the hydrogel or the nanolipid particle. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, Gates loves this kind of thing because they can hijack your brain when you\u2019re sleeping or just reading the magazine because they can do computing power in the background like a computer and they\u2019re going to make money off of you and you didn\u2019t know it, right? If you accept this technology inside of you. They also want to use it with social credit system of China. I\u2019m kind of speeding through some of these things just because I want to get to the pictures of what I saw inside the microscope. Dr. Carrie Madej: But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t believe what I say. That\u2019s fine. Just know that Bill Gates does. His company in West Africa, along with MasterCard, along with Trust Stamp and artificial intelligence program have combined forces. Since July, 2020, they\u2019ve been experimenting on the people there. Giving them the same shots we have here. Same technology. They are giving them a barcode or a numeric number. Each one is unique. Everything\u2019s downloaded, their medical records, their vaccination records, and their ability to do commodity is also downloaded, downloaded into their body. Doesn\u2019t that sound like something from the book of Revelation? And if they don\u2019t accept it, they\u2019re locked out. It\u2019s a war on cash. Dr. Carrie Madej: So since they have this technology inside the people, what Bill Gates said, he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, since we already have the hydrogel nanolipid particle inside of you, we\u2019re also going to start using it for surveillance and predictive policing.\u201d Just like I warned you about. They\u2019re doing it to the people right now like the Tom cruise Minority Report. They say once it\u2019s perfected there, all developed countries will get it. That\u2019s you and me too guys. What do they call it? Wellness pass or a vaccine passport. This is why we fight, this is why we say no, this is why we do not comply. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so I talked a lot about this, right? And how did I even get to know about this? Well, if some of you heard my story, you\u2019ll know that at some point of my career, I was recruited. They thought I would be a good person on their side. I was recruited to business owners meetings in Metro Atlanta, as well as scientific meetings where I got to meet Dr. Craig Venter, okay? And so in these meetings, they talked about this whole transhumanist movement and how it was great. We would be the controllers in the room. Don\u2019t worry. We would be exempt. Everybody else would be controlled. I was horrified. I was horrified to see everybody standing ovation and clapping for this. Like who are they? And I asked, \u201cHow could you be for this?\u201d They said, \u201cOh, well, it does sound a little bad, but you know what? Carrie, soon it\u2019s going to be us or them. And so we have to. You\u2019re going to want to be on our side. You don\u2019t want to be on the other side. It\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d Dr. Carrie Madej: I said, \u201cI would never do that. And you\u2019re a fool. You\u2019re a fool to think that this technology wouldn\u2019t be turned back on you because we are human beings, right?\u201d And they have a super computer that wants to guide all of this. A computer doesn\u2019t care who you are. It has an algorithm. You have a dollar sign in your head. Sound like the Marines, all for one, one for all. Computers sees it as foolish, frivolous, right? So I had all this knowledge. That\u2019s how I got to know how to research for it, but I was still not happy. I\u2019m a person. I have to know, right? So I decided I\u2019m going to look at inside of these vials, even though it\u2019s not legal, I don\u2019t care because if something goes against my God-given rights and my human rights, it is my duty to break that law. Dr. Carrie Madej: This is our world, our planet, our children, our bodies. Don\u2019t give it away. It\u2019s ours, right? So this is one of the pictures of Moderna. I put two drops on a glass slide. I had a compound microscope. That\u2019s it guys. You could get it easily. 300 bucks. And I had a white light going up on the middle and a glass top on the very top. And that\u2019s it. I waited two hours and it was translucent at first then all of a sudden colors appeared. Vibrant purples, blues, reds, greens. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this chemical reaction.\u201d There was no chemical reaction, right? So I ended up finding out all these colors, actually, when they appear under a white light, that\u2019s a sign of a super conducting material inside these injections. All the manufacturers have that. What that means, it\u2019s proof they\u2019re putting an injectable computing system inside every single one of these vials. An injectable computing system. Did they say anything to any of us? No. Dr. Carrie Madej: There\u2019s little cubes on this one. Were just showing some of these photos. Here\u2019s another one. It\u2019s hard to see on this photo, but at the very edge, there\u2019s a cube-like structure. We\u2019re not quite sure exactly what that is right now. So also I saw a lot of metallic flex fragments. I didn\u2019t see anything about metal fragments on the ingredient list again. And these metallic fragments to me look a little more exotic. It\u2019s not like your typical aluminum, et cetera, right? This one is strange. It\u2019s so opaque. It leaves its own shadow. Some of these pictures are between 100 times magnification, which is nothing, to 400 up to 600 times magnification. This is not nanotechnology. This is not looking at nanotechnology. This is at a much grander scale. This is crazy. Dr. Carrie Madej: So this picture kind of has been going around I think. I\u2019m going to give you a close-up of him. This was on the first slide I did and there\u2019s the cover slip, right? So everything gravitated to the very edges of the cover slip. That\u2019s where I saw a lot of action. There was a lot of aggregation. There is self-assembling. This is two hours. It\u2019s not like 12 hours. Two hours time. I also saw this thing. I was shocked. It actually was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. You can\u2019t see it? Okay. It was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. It had tentacles like you see here. It was able to move. It is my opinion and it is my interpretation that it was self-aware. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like that. I\u2019ve done slides, I\u2019ve done all kinds of preparation of slides of biologic materials, et cetera. Never have I witnessed anything like that. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so I did cry. I cried. And then I thought, well, okay, perhaps that was a fluke. Surely maybe some contamination, right? So two months later, I get another Moderna vial and I look at it under the microscope and here\u2019s\u2026 What is that? Still trying to figure it out guys, but we shouldn\u2019t have unidentified objects inside of these injections. Another of these string-like material, I\u2019m like looking I\u2019m like, \u201cThis almost looks like some kind of a living organism.\u201d And then I see another one. And then I cried hard. You may not know what that means. I do. These are parasites better made to meld with your nervous tissue. Imagine a child that is forming their neural network. I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to get that righteous anger. We need it now. No more. Dr. Carrie Madej: Just on a side, if you know the book of Revelation, does it kind of look like a scorpion? Guess what else it can do. The tentacles, it\u2019s called Hydra vulgaris. The tentacles have the ability to give a paralyzing, a venomous or a toxic reaction. Wow, it sounds like something else that I read, right? Why would they want that? Well, Hydra vulgaris is actually a organism, and I don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s an organism that is immortal in the lab. It can continually renew itself. If you chop it up into tiny pieces, put in a petri dish, it will actually self-assemble itself back over and over and over again innumerable times. It\u2019ll make itself anew. If you chop off a tentacle, three more will grow. And the transhumanists love this organism. They think it\u2019s fantastic. Again, that was 100 magnification, I\u2019m sorry, the last one. So this is the edge of the cover slip. There\u2019s a lot of debris kind of grapheme-like material. And then we start to see a lot of ring structures in here. Dr. Carrie Madej: Now, this one is with the Johnson & Johnson vial. Let me get to the\u2026 So, again, ring-like structures. What they are is they appear to be delivery systems. So they\u2019ll start like this and they get bigger, bigger, bigger. They fend themselves out. A gelatinous material extrudes from it like a hydrogel, okay? And then this was like a bundle of cells growing. What are those cells? We don\u2019t know. We need to analyze them. What kind of cells are being injected into people? A crystalline structure, little crystals. Like literally, this is like a kitchen sink, dirty kind of a experiment going on. These are iridescence silicone-like wafers. If they pile on top of each other, they can make their own circuitry boards. Hydrogel it\u2019s a gelatinous material here. Again, more hydrogel with more of these spheres, these rings. So I saw them at all the manufacturers, all of them. So no one is different than another. I don\u2019t care if they come up with a new one, guys. Don\u2019t ask me if it\u2019s safe to take it. They\u2019re all bad. Dr. Carrie Madej: So I was very fortunate to work with Project Veritas recently. So bravo, right? They\u2019re amazing patriots. Another round of applause. So they will be releasing their findings soon. I worked with them. And so we were looking under the microscope at Pfizer vial and they have documentation to share too from a brave whistleblower. So anyway, this is a Pfizer vial. You see a lot of these dark particles. These are like graphene oxide particle material. So what we were witnessing over time under the microscope was something called Teslaphoresis. Have you heard of that? So what that means is that you can put all these little tiny beads, let\u2019s say, that have the potential to make their own wiring in the body. And what you do is you could just have an external magnetic force or another kind of electric force, let\u2019s say, or frequency, and they will start to form and coalesce into a string-like spider web all by themselves. Dr. Carrie Madej: So you just have to put the junk in somewhere, turn on a frequency and voila, it starts to make its own neural network, a string-like consistency. We were seeing it here inside of this vial starting to coalesce, starting to form structures. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to see, but up there, if I can do a pointer. Can\u2019t see my pointer. Anyhow, there\u2019s a [inaudible 00:37:55] kind of figure in the middle. So if you knew what a human nerve cell looked like, a dendrite, it would look just like this, but this isn\u2019t from a human guys. This is from whatever they\u2019re injecting inside of you. Literally, this is my opinion, they\u2019re trying to put another kind of nervous system inside of you, but an AI kind, or they\u2019re hijacking this parasite to put inside of you. These are my hypotheses. I encourage you to do your own research. And for the people who don\u2019t believe me, under the microscope, you can get a $300 microscope and you can put the drops on there and you can look and see the pictures too, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So this is another organism. We see this over and over. This would be like a Polypodium or a Hydra vulgaris organism. Again, we see this over, over, over. It\u2019s not a mistake. It\u2019s in different states, multiple vials, multiple batches, multiple times. There\u2019s no mistake. Another one. This is very similar to some ectoderm of a parasite. We could go on and on, parasite after parasite looking\u2026 And let me back up. They appear to be parasites, right? If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it probably is, right? Again, more ring-like structures. Dr. Carrie Madej: How is this in the betterment of humanity? Is this why ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are so banned from everybody? Right? Now we know. I want you to see this guy. This guy is another organism that we saw. This was in a Johnson & Johnson vial. Watch closely the translucent thing that moves around the edge of the ring. Do you see that? At first I thought it was another\u2026 Let me back up and do that again so you can see. Okay. Oops, I\u2019m going to try to do this properly. Okay. All right. Play. Ah, sorry guys. Anyway, it\u2019s a translucent\u2026 I thought it was like a larvae, like another life form, but the way it moved was more robotic to me. This could be a nanobot. We don\u2019t know. I\u2019m showing you pictures. And I think you don\u2019t have to have a science degree. You don\u2019t have to have a medical degree to know that should not be in any human body injected into to our children, our babies, and us. Dr. Carrie Madej: I want to show you this. We had a healthy blood of a young man, put a drop under the slide. It moved normally, right? Every time we added a drop of the injection from the Pfizer vial, this organism formed, which looked just like the coronavirus. You know what? It wasn\u2019t in the vial by itself. It wasn\u2019t in the blood. Only when the blood and the injection, or I\u2019m sorry, the contents of the vial hit together, that formed. I want to hypothesize that this structure they\u2019re calling the coronavirus is inside these vials. It\u2019s a hypothesis that\u2019s saying, we need to look into it. Dr. Carrie Madej: I want you to see how much\u2026 This is one drop of Moderna. One drop. One drop. Look at the movement. It\u2019s not normal. They tell you they\u2019re putting living organisms inside of you. This is just more graphing kind of a substance. Hydra vulgaris, look it up. UC Davis loves this against the transhumanist movement because of all of this. And it\u2019s kind of funny they like to say hail Hydra. Have you heard of that before? Symbolism is everywhere. Watch for it then you\u2019ll know who they serve. Just more about the hail Hydra and its life forms, but I like to always see symbolism, right? So the grown version of this Hydra is called a medusa and the Hydra also means many headed serpent. Wow, I read that before on the book of Revelation. This is just showing how they can chop it up and put it into a vial and then it can grow itself again once it\u2019s in its host. Dr. Carrie Madej: I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you. I\u2019ll go back. Sorry about that. Okay, got it. Is that good? Okay, got it. Okay, this slide was just to show you that maybe one may not be Hydro vulgaris. Maybe it\u2019s Nematostella or Acropora. Okay, my point is it comes from the same family. They all can do the same things, okay? We can go into splicing hairs later, but this is just to show you that they all can do this. And so my warning to you is this is a picture. It says a thousand words, right? And I want to shock you. I want to make you have emotion and passion because that\u2019s what we need right now. Dr. Carrie Madej: And people ask me, \u201cWell, how did this happen and how do we get out of it?\u201d Why we got here it\u2019s one reason. We disconnected ourselves from God, our Father in heaven. God did not leave us. We love God. We need to make that right. These are praying and worshiping and putting God first in everything and remembering who you are and what you are. You are royal birthright. You have a divinity inside of you, a light that God gave every single one of us if you choose to connect with it because we have free will, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: If you haven\u2019t read on Jesus Christ, you should because he gave us the instructions on what to do right now. With God we are unstoppable. We are powerful beings. We don\u2019t have to be afraid of any of this technology because with God, we have this force that in a blink of an eye, we change it all. And you just don\u2019t know who you are yet. And I\u2019m here with you because I\u2019m here to remind you who you are. And for my last breath on this earth, I will fight with you and for you and for the world and for our children. There\u2019s nothing greater in this world. Thank you. [inaudible 00:45:01]. Ty Bollinger: Dr. Carrie Madej. Wow, that was amazing. That was amazing. I was watching that for quite a while from the back and blown away with a lot of that stuff. A lot of the stuff I was not even aware of though. Thank you Dr. Madej.

        "link":"https:\/\/csglobe.com\/is-usa-lying-to-who-on-virus-data\/",
        "text":"Numbers have a certain mystique: They seem precise, exact, sometimes even beyond doubt. But outside the field of pure mathematics, this reputation rarely is deserved. And when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic, buying into that can be downright dangerous. Naturally, everyone wants to know how deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is. We know, irrefutably, one thing about the coronavirus in the United States: The number of cases reported in every chart and table is far too low. The other problem is, now that the U.S. appears to be ramping up testing, the number of cases will grow quickly. Public-health officials are currently cautioning people not to worry as that happens, but it will be hard to disambiguate what proportion of the ballooning number of cases is the result of more testing and what proportion is from the actual spread of the virus. People trust data. Numbers seem real. Charts have charismatic power. People believe what can be quantified. But data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world. The reality gap between American numbers and American cases is wide. Regular citizens and decision makers cannot rely on only the numbers to make decisions. Sometimes quantification actually obscures as much as it reveals. Just a day ago, an example of how WHO manipulate the numbers regarding U.S! Below you have two screenshots from WHO official website, the first part is from: March 22, 2020, 17:44 GMT; the second one: March 22, 2020, 21:30 GMT. Decide yourself! The first part: The second part: Please do not forget: Protect yourself and your family! Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following: Wash your hands frequently Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain social distancing Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Practice respiratory hygiene Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.",

        "link":"https:\/\/csglobe.com\/leaked-cdc-document-contradicts-pence-claim-that-u-s-coronavirus-cases-have-stabilized\/",
        "text":"Even as Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. \u201chave stabilized,\u201d a document produced that same day by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and circulated to the other government agencies warns that infections in the U.S. have increased more than 18 percent. \u201cCases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000 \u2014 down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May,\u201d Pence wrote Tuesday in his op-ed, which defended President Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic. Yet the CDC\u2019s June 16 COVID-19 Response Update appears to paint a darker portrait of the state of the pandemic, with maps showing many counties in the U.S. experiencing increasing rates of the coronavirus. Of the figures highlighted, a chart shows that the U.S. rate of increase for the coronavirus using a three-day average is 18.3 percent. By comparison, two of the hardest-hit countries have declining rates based on this same three-day average: Brazil\u2019s cases came down 27 percent, and Russia\u2019s have decreased by almost 7 percent. Neither the CDC nor Pence\u2019s office responded to a request for comment. Pence remains the head of the White House coronavirus task force, which has all but faded from view in recent weeks. The task force\u2019s last public briefing was in late April, though its members still meet regularly. In a press briefing Friday, June 12, CDC Director Robert Redfield indicated that some of the increasing case numbers result from more widespread testing at facilities that have had large outbreaks, such as nursing homes, prisons and meat-processing facilities, but even that is \u201cnot explaining everything.\u201d The CDC update is marked as an \u201cinternal\u201d government document, meaning it is not intended to be released to the public. Yahoo News obtained a copy of the report, which was distributed within the government the same day Pence\u2019s op-ed was published. The explanatory text accompanying the CDC maps also appears to contradict Pence\u2019s optimistic message about the coronavirus. \u201cThere remains a large number of counties whose burden continues to grow or are in an elevated incidence plateau, including in Wyoming, Iowa, Washington, California and in parts of the Southwest and Southeast,\u201d the CDC document reads in a caption accompanying a map showing large swaths of the country as either in \u201celevated incidence\u201d or \u201crebound\u201d for coronavirus cases. A separate map showing the number of new cases notes that \u201celevated incidence of disease during the past 2 weeks remains widespread, including in the Northeast (and the New York City area), the Southwest, the Southeast, DC, areas around Chicago, and parts of California, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington.\u201d Pence\u2019s op-ed also appeared on the same day the Wall Street Journal ran an article based on an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, who sounded a far more pessimistic view about the country\u2019s progress than the vice president. \u201cPeople keep talking about a second wave,\u201d Fauci told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a first wave.\u201d Fauci also disputed the idea that testing alone accounts for the recent rise in U.S. cases, a claim regularly made by President Trump. Despite the divergence regarding whether COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have \u201cstabilized,\u201d Pence and the CDC appear to be in sync when it comes to figures showing significantly declining death rates. Pence wrote that \u201cin the past five days, deaths are down to fewer than 750 a day, a dramatic decline from 2,500 a day a few weeks ago \u2014 and a far cry from the 5,000 a day that some were predicting.\u201d According to the CDC documents, death rates have declined by about 22 percent, based on the prior three-day average. New deaths are down to 646, even lower than Pence noted, though the average number of new deaths, the CDC document says, is at 829.",

The biotech CEO joins a growing list of high-profile figures who in recent months have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (using flawed tests) despite being fully vaccinated and boosted, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and US President Joe Biden.

Critics believe that these leaders did not take the gene therapy \u201cvaccines\u201d.

        "text":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is moving ahead with plans to enact a new international pandemic treaty, despite objections to the plan. The WHO director-general may already declare a public health emergency in any country, without the consent of that country\u2019s government. Dr. Mercola is concerned that the WHO would get the power to implement digital identities\/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more. A US Department of Homeland Security contractor described vaccine certificates\/ passports as driving \u201cthe whole field of digital ID in the future,\u201d adding they are \u201cnot just about COVID [but] about something even bigger\u201d and that \u201conce adopted for COVID [they] will be rapidly used for everything else.\u201d Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, African Union and World Bank, which created a $1 billion fund for \u201cdisease surveillance,\u201d are developing their own pandemic response mechanisms, including new cross-country vaccine passport frameworks. The World Health Organization (WHO) is moving ahead with plans to enact a new or revised international pandemic preparedness treaty, despite encountering setbacks earlier this summer after dozens of countries, primarily outside the Western world, objected to the plan. A majority of WHO member states on July 21, during a meeting of WHO\u2019s Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), agreed to pursue a legally binding pandemic instrument that will contain \u201cboth legally binding as well as non-legally binding elements.\u201d STAT News described the agreement, which would create a new global framework for responding to pandemics, as \u201cthe most transformative global health call to action since [the] WHO itself was formed as the first specialized United Nations agency in 1948.\u201d Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, African Union and World Bank \u2014 which created a $1 billion fund for \u201cdisease surveillance\u201d and \u201csupport against the current as well as future pandemics\u201d \u2014 are developing their own pandemic response mechanisms, including new cross-country vaccine passport frameworks. WHO\u2019s \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019: what\u2019s been proposed and what would it mean? Ongoing talks to formulate a new or revised \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d are building on the existing international framework for global pandemic response, the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations (IHR), considered a binding instrument of international law. On Dec. 1, 2021, in response to calls from various governments for a \u201cstrengthened global pandemic strategy\u201d and signaling the urgency with which these entities are acting, the WHO formally launched the process of creating a new treaty or amending the IHR, during Special Session \u2014 only the second in the organization\u2019s history During the meeting, held May 10-11, WHO\u2019s 194 member countries unanimously agreed to launch the process, which previously had been discussed only informally. The member countries agreed to: \u201cKickstart a global process to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument under the Constitution of the World Health Organization to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.\u201d The IHR, a relatively recent development, were first enacted in 2005, in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-1. The IHR legal framework is one of only two binding treaties the WHO has achieved since its inception, the other being the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The IHR framework already allows the WHO director-general to declare a public health emergency in any country, without the consent of that country\u2019s government, though the framework requires the two sides to first attempt to reach an agreement. The proposals for a new or revised pandemic treaty, put forth at the special ministerial session of the WHO in May, would \u201csomewhat\u201d strengthen the WHO\u2019s pandemic-related powers, including establishing a \u201cCompliance Committee\u201d that would issue advisory recommendations for states. However, according to the Daily Sceptic, while the IHR is already legally binding, the amendments proposed in May would not strengthen existing legal obligations or requirements: \u201cThe existing treaty regulations, like all (or most) international law, do not actually compel states to do anything other than talk to the WHO and listen to it, and neither do they specify sanctions for non-compliance; almost all their output is advice. \u201cThe proposed amendments don\u2019t alter that. They don\u2019t allow the WHO unilaterally to impose legally binding measures on or within countries.\u201d The Daily Sceptic noted one of the risks stemming from the negotiations for a new or updated treaty include the potential codification of \u201cthe new lockdown orthodoxy for future pandemics,\u201d which would \u201creplace the sound, science-based, pre-COVID recommendations\u201d previously in place. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, such a treaty would grant the WHO \u201cabsolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities\/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more.\u201d Mercola also questioned a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response,\u201d pointing out that \u201cpandemic threats are not identical in all parts of the world. In his view, he said, \u201cthe WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions.\u201d Similar concerns contributed at least in part to opposition against the proposals presented at the special ministerial session, during which a bloc of mostly non-Western countries, including China, India, Russia and 47 African nations, prevented an agreement from being finalized. Will opposition fade away? Although no final agreement was achieved at the May meeting, consensus was reached to organize a new special ministerial session of the WHO later this year, possibly after the WHO\u2019s World Health Assembly, scheduled for Nov. 29 through Dec. 1, Reuters reported. Mxolisi Nkosi, South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the UN, told the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial assembly the new special session would \u201cconsider the benefits for such a convention, agreement or other international instrument.\u201d Nkosi added: \u201cProbably the most important lesson COVID-19 has taught us is the need for stronger and more agile collective defences against health threats as well as for building resilience to address future potential pandemics. \u201cA new pandemic treaty is central to this.\u201d At the time, the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Simon Manley, addressing the lack of an immediate agreement and the consensus to hold a new meeting, tweeted \u201cnegotiations may take time, but this is a historic step towards global health security. The INB, at its meeting held in Geneva July 18-21, also agreed with this view, reaching a consensus that its members will work on finalizing a new legally binding international pandemic agreement by May 2024. As part of this process, the INB will meet again in December and will deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2023. According to the WHO, \u201cAny new agreement, if any when agreed by Member States, is drafted and negotiated by governments themselves, [which] will take any action in line with their sovereignty.\u201d The WHO further claims that \u201cgovernments themselves will determine actions under the accord while considering their own national laws and regulations.\u201d The Biden administration expressed broad support for a new or updated pandemic treaty, with the U.S. heading previous negotiations on this issue, along with the European Commission, via its president Ursula von der Leyen, who, as previously reported by The Defender, is also a strong proponent of vaccine passports and mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. An analysis by the Alliance for Natural Health International speculated that any final agreement may simply strengthen the existing IHR or, alternatively, may involve an amendment to the WHO\u2019s constitution \u2014 or both. Just two days after the July 21 INB agreement, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s director-general, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that alongside the process of negotiating a new [international] accord on pandemic preparedness & response, WHO\u2019s Member States are also considering targeted amendments to the [IHR], incl. ways to improve the process for declaring a [public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC].\u201d In the same Twitter thread, he also declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak \u201ca public health emergency of international concern,\u201d one \u201cthat is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.\u201d Notably, the WHO director-general overruled an expert panel that was divided over whether to classify the outbreak as a global public health emergency. With this declaration, three \u201cglobal health emergencies\u201d are now in place, as determined by the WHO: COVID-19, monkeypox and polio. Busy summer for vaccine passport proposals While the WHO and global governments weigh plans for an updated or new pandemic treaty, other organizations are moving forward on vaccine passport technologies and partnerships. On July 8, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of many of the world\u2019s industrialized nations, announced it would promote the unification of the different vaccine passport systems currently in use around the world. Thirty-six countries and international organizations participated in a July meeting with the goal of \u201ccreating a multilateral framework for establishing a global vaccine passport regime,\u201d according to Nick Corbishley of Naked Capitalism. The development is a continuation of efforts involving the WHO to harmonize global vaccine passport regimes. In February, the WHO selected Germany\u2019s T-Systems as an \u201cindustry partner to develop the vaccination validation service,\u201d which would enable \u201cvaccination certificates to be checked across national borders.\u201d T-Systems, an arm of Deutsche Telekom, was previously instrumental in developing the interoperability of vaccine passport systems in Europe. Also in July, 21 African governments \u201cquietly embraced\u201d a vaccine passport system, which in turn would also be interlinked with other such systems globally. On July 8, which is also Africa Integration Day, the African Union and the Africa Centers for Disease Control launched a digital vaccine passport valid throughout the African Union, describing it as \u201cthe e-health backbone\u201d of Africa\u2019s \u201cnew health order.\u201d This follows the development in 2021, of the Trusted Travel platform, now required by several African countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Togo and Zimbabwe, and air carriers such as EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways, for both inbound and outbound travel. Beyond Africa, Indonesia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20, is conducting \u201cpilot projects\u201d that would bring about the interoperability of the various digital vaccine passport systems currently in use globally. The project is expected to be completed by November, in time for the G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit. Naked Capitalism highlighted the role of South African company Cassava Fintech in the efforts to develop an interoperable vaccine passport for all of Africa. A subsidiary of African telecommunication company Econet, Cassava initially developed the \u201cSasail\u201d app, which the company described as Africa\u2019s first \u201cglobal super app\u201d that combines \u201csocial payments\u201d with the ability to send and receive money and pay bills, chat with others and play games. Cassava and Econet entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, \u201cto advance digital inclusion across Africa and collaborate on a range of initiatives, including expansion of the Africa CDC TravelPass.\u201d As previously reported by The Defender, Mastercard supports the Good Health Pass vaccine passport initiative that is also backed by the ID2020 alliance and endorsed by embattled former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair. Mastercard has also promoted technology that can be embedded into the DO Card, a credit\/debit card that keeps track of one\u2019s \u201cpersonal carbon allowance.\u201d ID2020, founded in 2016, claims to support \u201cethical, privacy-protecting approaches to digital ID.\u201d Its founding partners include Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation, Accenture, GAVI-The Vaccine Alliance (itself a core partner of the WHO), UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank. Mastercard\u2019s top two stockholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which hold significant stakes in dozens of companies that supported the development of vaccine passports or implemented vaccine mandates for their employees. The two investment firms also hold large stakes in vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.

The biotech CEO joins a growing list of high-profile figures who in recent months have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (using flawed tests) despite being fully vaccinated and boosted, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and US President Joe Biden. Most recently, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tested positive for a second time Monday, despite being quadruple vaccinated. Critics believe that these leaders did not take the gene therapy \u201cvaccines\u201d. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Monday admitted he tested positive for Covid-19, despite receiving four experimental vaccine doses produced by the corporation he chairs meant to fight the disease. \u201cI would like to let you know that I have tested positive for #COVID19,\u201d Bourla, 60, announced on Twitter Monday. \u201cI am thankful to have received four doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and I am feeling well while experiencing very mild symptoms,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI am isolating and have started a course of Paxlovid.\u201d Despite contracting the very disease the vaccines were intended to fend off, Bourla went on to thank colleagues for the vaccine: We have come so far in our efforts to battle this disease that I am confident I will have a speedy recovery. I am incredibly grateful for the tireless efforts of my Pfizer colleagues who worked to make vaccines and treatments available for me and people around the world. He also gave a shameless plug for another Pfizer product, Paxlovid: \u201cPaxlovid is not approved, but is authorized for emergency use by the FDA to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients 12+, weighing at least 40 kg, with positive results of SARS-CoV-2 viral testing. See safety info: http:\/\/COVID19oralRx.com.\u201d In March, Bourla promoted the notion that a fourth mRNA jab would be needed to address another wave of Covid-19 because immunity wanes after each dose. The biotech CEO joins a growing list of high-profile figures who in recent months have contracted Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated and boosted, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, US President Joe Biden, and most recently Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who tested positive for a second time Monday also despite being quadruple vaccinated.

What some people are now experiencing that the media is calling monkeypox could actually be chickenpox or shingles.

        "text":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is moving ahead with plans to enact a new international pandemic treaty, despite objections to the plan. The WHO director-general may already declare a public health emergency in any country, without the consent of that country\u2019s government. Dr. Mercola is concerned that the WHO would get the power to implement digital identities\/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more. A US Department of Homeland Security contractor described vaccine certificates\/ passports as driving \u201cthe whole field of digital ID in the future,\u201d adding they are \u201cnot just about COVID [but] about something even bigger\u201d and that \u201conce adopted for COVID [they] will be rapidly used for everything else.\u201d Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, African Union and World Bank, which created a $1 billion fund for \u201cdisease surveillance,\u201d are developing their own pandemic response mechanisms, including new cross-country vaccine passport frameworks. The World Health Organization (WHO) is moving ahead with plans to enact a new or revised international pandemic preparedness treaty, despite encountering setbacks earlier this summer after dozens of countries, primarily outside the Western world, objected to the plan. A majority of WHO member states on July 21, during a meeting of WHO\u2019s Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), agreed to pursue a legally binding pandemic instrument that will contain \u201cboth legally binding as well as non-legally binding elements.\u201d STAT News described the agreement, which would create a new global framework for responding to pandemics, as \u201cthe most transformative global health call to action since [the] WHO itself was formed as the first specialized United Nations agency in 1948.\u201d Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, African Union and World Bank \u2014 which created a $1 billion fund for \u201cdisease surveillance\u201d and \u201csupport against the current as well as future pandemics\u201d \u2014 are developing their own pandemic response mechanisms, including new cross-country vaccine passport frameworks. WHO\u2019s \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019: what\u2019s been proposed and what would it mean? Ongoing talks to formulate a new or revised \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d are building on the existing international framework for global pandemic response, the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations (IHR), considered a binding instrument of international law. On Dec. 1, 2021, in response to calls from various governments for a \u201cstrengthened global pandemic strategy\u201d and signaling the urgency with which these entities are acting, the WHO formally launched the process of creating a new treaty or amending the IHR, during Special Session \u2014 only the second in the organization\u2019s history During the meeting, held May 10-11, WHO\u2019s 194 member countries unanimously agreed to launch the process, which previously had been discussed only informally. The member countries agreed to: \u201cKickstart a global process to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument under the Constitution of the World Health Organization to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.\u201d The IHR, a relatively recent development, were first enacted in 2005, in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-1. The IHR legal framework is one of only two binding treaties the WHO has achieved since its inception, the other being the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The IHR framework already allows the WHO director-general to declare a public health emergency in any country, without the consent of that country\u2019s government, though the framework requires the two sides to first attempt to reach an agreement. The proposals for a new or revised pandemic treaty, put forth at the special ministerial session of the WHO in May, would \u201csomewhat\u201d strengthen the WHO\u2019s pandemic-related powers, including establishing a \u201cCompliance Committee\u201d that would issue advisory recommendations for states. However, according to the Daily Sceptic, while the IHR is already legally binding, the amendments proposed in May would not strengthen existing legal obligations or requirements: \u201cThe existing treaty regulations, like all (or most) international law, do not actually compel states to do anything other than talk to the WHO and listen to it, and neither do they specify sanctions for non-compliance; almost all their output is advice. \u201cThe proposed amendments don\u2019t alter that. They don\u2019t allow the WHO unilaterally to impose legally binding measures on or within countries.\u201d The Daily Sceptic noted one of the risks stemming from the negotiations for a new or updated treaty include the potential codification of \u201cthe new lockdown orthodoxy for future pandemics,\u201d which would \u201creplace the sound, science-based, pre-COVID recommendations\u201d previously in place. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, such a treaty would grant the WHO \u201cabsolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities\/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more.\u201d Mercola also questioned a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response,\u201d pointing out that \u201cpandemic threats are not identical in all parts of the world. In his view, he said, \u201cthe WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions.\u201d Similar concerns contributed at least in part to opposition against the proposals presented at the special ministerial session, during which a bloc of mostly non-Western countries, including China, India, Russia and 47 African nations, prevented an agreement from being finalized. Will opposition fade away? Although no final agreement was achieved at the May meeting, consensus was reached to organize a new special ministerial session of the WHO later this year, possibly after the WHO\u2019s World Health Assembly, scheduled for Nov. 29 through Dec. 1, Reuters reported. Mxolisi Nkosi, South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the UN, told the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial assembly the new special session would \u201cconsider the benefits for such a convention, agreement or other international instrument.\u201d Nkosi added: \u201cProbably the most important lesson COVID-19 has taught us is the need for stronger and more agile collective defences against health threats as well as for building resilience to address future potential pandemics. \u201cA new pandemic treaty is central to this.\u201d At the time, the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Simon Manley, addressing the lack of an immediate agreement and the consensus to hold a new meeting, tweeted \u201cnegotiations may take time, but this is a historic step towards global health security. The INB, at its meeting held in Geneva July 18-21, also agreed with this view, reaching a consensus that its members will work on finalizing a new legally binding international pandemic agreement by May 2024. As part of this process, the INB will meet again in December and will deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2023. According to the WHO, \u201cAny new agreement, if any when agreed by Member States, is drafted and negotiated by governments themselves, [which] will take any action in line with their sovereignty.\u201d The WHO further claims that \u201cgovernments themselves will determine actions under the accord while considering their own national laws and regulations.\u201d The Biden administration expressed broad support for a new or updated pandemic treaty, with the U.S. heading previous negotiations on this issue, along with the European Commission, via its president Ursula von der Leyen, who, as previously reported by The Defender, is also a strong proponent of vaccine passports and mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.

        "text":"From The Epoch Times: Ten percent of Americans who received the COVID-19 vaccine regret having done so, according to a recent poll. In addition, 15 percent of the 1,038 adults that took the survey said that they have been diagnosed with a new condition by a medical practitioner, weeks or months after taking the vaccine. Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) commissioned the poll two years after the inception of Operation Warp Speed in order to find out about people\u2019s position on the COVID vaccines and their health. The poll, conducted by Zogby Analytics, states that the margin of error is +\/- 3.1 percentage points. \u201cThe fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports more than 232 million Americans ages 18\u201365 have taken at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 15 percent of those surveyed report a newly diagnosed condition is concerning and needs further study,\u201d said Laura Bono, CHD\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe mRNA vaccine technology is new and clinical trials naturally have no long-term data. CHD believes this survey points to the need for further study.\u201d Sixty-seven percent of the respondents got one or more shots, while the rest were unvaccinated. Among those who took the COVID vaccines, 6 percent took one dose, while the rest took 2\u20134 shots. Of the newly diagnosed medical conditions, the most common ones were blood clots (21 percent), heart attack (19 percent), liver damage (18 percent), leg and lung clots (17 percent), and stroke (15 percent). Sixty-seven percent of participants said that getting the vaccine was a good decision, while 24 percent were neutral. Another poll conducted at the same time surveyed 829 American adults ages 18\u201349, and the results show that 22 percent of them reported a new condition within weeks or months after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. The top conditions were autoimmune problems, blood clots, stroke\/lung clots, liver damage\/leg clots\/heart attack, and disrupted menstrual cycle. Ten percent of these conditions were severe. Fourteen percent of the participants regretted taking the vaccine, while 58 percent thought it was a good decision, and the rest were neutral. Previous Reports In May, a cardiologist told The Epoch Times that he has seen a spike in cases of heart inflammation. Although the media has given more attention to COVID vaccine blood clot issues, there have been many more cases of myocarditis, according to his observation. Some doctors have also observed menstrual irregularities associated with the COVID-19 vaccines, something that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said is an issue that needs to be studied more. Also in May, The Epoch Times reported that a pediatric cardiologist had to stop working and was punished by his board for not wanting to recommend a vaccine to a young patient who had contracted COVID previously. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel on June 15 unanimously recommended the FDA give emergency authorization to the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as 6 months of age. The U.S. drug regulators on March 29 announced they had granted emergency authorization allowing a fourth dose of the jabs to be given to all Americans aged 50 and above.

        "link":"https:\/\/prepareforchange.net\/2022\/08\/08\/biden-once-again-extends-covid-19-public-health-emergency\/",
        "text":"From theeopochtimes.com: The Biden administration has granted a 90-day extension for the COVID-19 emergency, which was set to expire on July 15. This means that government spending, which has already driven the debt to near-record levels, will continue. An extension of this state of emergency allows for the continued distribution of unapproved vaccines, under emergency use authorization. These drugs, which are still available for free, represent U.S. taxpayer money and government debt being used to pay private pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars. So far, 599 million doses have been administered in the U.S. at a cost of around $15 each, paid for by the government. The extension means that in some states, low-income families may be entitled to enhanced food stamps and continued stimulus checks. Numerous federal and state-funded health programs will continue. California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, and 10 other states are still sending out checks. Other programs extended through September include the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT), and a 15 percent increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. SNAP can now be used to make online purchases, so it is even easier to spend the free money. Additionally, there is $1 billion in nutrition assistance for American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands (CNMI), and Puerto Rico. In late January 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency (PHE). The following year, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was passed. It included a $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund, and $350 billion Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. States are also able to access other monies to fight the pandemic. Extending the Pandemic Extends the Debt COVID-19 spending has increased government borrowing in excess of the 2020 debt ceiling. The United States debt ceiling\u2014or debt limit\u2014is a limit on the amount of national debt that an administration can incur. In December of 2021, Congress raised the U.S. debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, to cover the government\u2019s operations until after the midterm elections in fall 2022. In order to pass the new debt ceiling, the rules had to be changed, which required a simple majority rather than 60 votes in the Senate, as had previously been the rule. Democrats voted for the debt ceiling increase. Republicans voted against it. And the measure was passed by a majority of 1 vote (with a 50 to 49 split). In March of 2021, the federal deficit hit $660 billion, and as of June of 2022, the U.S. public debt stood at $30.57 trillion. By the end of the year, it is predicted to exceed 137 percent of gross domestic product. Extending the pandemic will only make it worse. Overspending Can Continue Although many expected pandemic-related government spending and state of emergency extensions to end, the COVID-19 disaster has had an open incident period (the period of time during which a federally declared disaster is occurring) and open period of performance (the deadline for completing emergency work) since it was issued in 2020. This means that increased government spending can continue to drive up inflation. In an attempt to cool off the economy, the Fed has raised interest rates, but the effects will be muted if the government continues to spend. Meanwhile, the cost of borrowing has increased, making excessive government spending even more expensive. As prices continue to rise, it is becoming more difficult for low-earning Americans to support their basic needs. The Democratic response is to keep calling for a doubling of the federal minimum wage. Payroll accounts for between 15\u201330 percent of most business overhead. The average profit margin for small businesses is only 7\u201310 percent. Biden\u2019s plan for curbing inflation was to tell businesses to cut costs. Doubling the minimum wage would effectively wipe out the profits of most businesses. As a result, businesses would either shut down\u2014ballooning unemployment\u2014or they would have to increase their prices by as much as 30 percent to remain open and operate at the same profit level. If all businesses increase their prices by that much, Biden can achieve record hyperinflation. The other solution Democrats have come up with is to increase government welfare programs. Measures such as additional transfer payments to the poor, including continued stimulus checks and increased food stamps all represent government spending that must be financed through borrowing. Increasing the national debt will not only cause inflation in the medium-term but will weaken the American economy in the long run. To curb inflation, the United States needs to enact a contractionary fiscal policy. In other words, the government must put a moratorium on spending money it does not have. This means that the state of emergency related to the pandemic must be allowed to expire. The White House will also have to stop looking for other emergencies to declare. During the week of July 21, major media outlets reported their expectation that Biden would declare a climate emergency, although he has yet to do this. If he does, a brand-new cycle of spending can begin. As neither the pandemic nor the climate has specific, quantified endpoints, theoretically, the emergency could be continued forever.

        "text":"BY Doctors are allegedly baffled at what is causing a sudden uptick in what they have dubbed \u2018Sudden Adult Death Syndrome\u2019 among adults under the age of 40 over the past year, and are now urging all under 40\u2019s to go and get their heart checked. But these doctors need not remain \u201cbaffled\u201d any longer because we have rock-solid evidence that the Covid-19 vaccine is to blame. Official UK Office for National Statistics data shows vaccinated adults aged 18 to 39 have a 92% higher mortality rate (per 100,000) than unvaccinated adults. Official Public Health Scotland data reveals there has been a 67% increase compared to the historical average in the number of 15 to 44-year-olds suffering heart attacks, cardiac arrest, myocarditis, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases since this age group was first offered the Covid-19 injection. And figures published by NHS England in response to a freedom of information request show that ambulance call-outs for heart illness have doubled among all age groups including the under 30\u2019s since the beginning of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. Healthy young people are dying suddenly and unexpectedly from what doctors are dubbing \u201ca mysterious syndrome\u201d and these same doctors are now seeking answers through a new national register. People aged under 40 are now being urged to have their hearts checked because doctors claim they may potentially be at risk of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. Doctors say the syndrome, known as SADS, has been fatal for all kinds of people regardless of whether they maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle. \u201cSADS is an umbrella term to describe unexpected deaths in young people\u201d, said The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. But it turns out the term is actually used when a post-mortem cannot find an obvious cause of death, and the reason doctors are struggling to find an obvious cause of death is that we\u2019re now seeing thousands of deaths due to something that was impossible to occur prior to 2021. Covid-19 vaccination. This becomes obvious once you know where to look. But the problem is doctors are actively discouraged from looking and it is not publicised in the mainstream media. However, all the answers doctors are looking for to explain what they are dubbing Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, are contained in official Government data. Vaccinated Young Adults have a 92% higher mortality rate (per 100,000) than Unvaccinated Young Adults The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the UK\u2019s largest independent producer of official statistics and the recognised national statistical institute of the UK. It is responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. An ONS dataset on deaths in England by vaccination status can be found here. It contains a large amount of data on age-standardised mortality rates for deaths by vaccination status between 1 January 2021 and 31 January 2022. Table 2 of the dataset contains data on the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for all deaths in England. The following table shows an example of how the numbers are presented in the dataset \u2013 What immediately catches the eye when looking at this data is the mortality rate per 100,00 person-years among 18-39-year-olds in the month of January 2021. The figures show the death rate among the unvaccinated in this month was 67.7 deaths per 100,000 person-years. Whilst the death rate among the partly vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) was 119.9 deaths per 100,000 years. This shows that vaccinated 18-39-year-olds were more likely to die in January 2021, suggesting the Covid-19 injections increased the risk of death or played a part in causing death. So we dug further and extracted all the figures on 18-39-year-olds for each month between January 2021 and January 2022, and this is what we found \u2013 The above chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in England. The green line is the mortality rate among the unvaccinated, which while fluctuating has remained pretty stable throughout. The other lines however represent different vaccination statuses, and they are extremely concerning. The orange, yellow, and pink lines represent mortality rates within 21 days of receiving a first, second or third dose. And they reveal that the risk of death increases significantly immediately after vaccination. But the most concerning figures are the mortality rates among those vaccinated at least 21 days ago, which you can see more clearly in the following chart \u2013 What\u2019s most concerning here is that the second injection seems to make things much worse in terms of the risk of death. The highest mortality rate among the double vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) occurred in September 2021, with 125.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years. In the same month, the mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 46.8. Meaning the double vaccinated mortality rate was 169% higher than the unvaccinated mortality rate. But the largest statistical difference occurred in November 2021. The mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 33.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years, whereas the mortality rate among the double vaccinated equated to 107. A difference of 220.4%. The following chart shows the average-age standardised mortality rate to have occurred between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22 by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in England \u2013 On average the one-dose vaccinated were 51% more likely to die than the unvaccinated between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22. Whilst the double vaccinated were 91.4% more likely to die than the unvaccinated between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22. And based on the small amount of data available so far, on average the triple vaccinated are on average 25.3% more likely to die than the unvaccinated. What these official figures from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics strongly suggest is that Covid-19 vaccination kills and increases a person\u2019s risk of death due to any cause. And this increased risk of death isn\u2019t because so many people have been vaccinated, these are figures per 100,000. Any doctor worth their salt would not instantly use the above to claim that Covid-19 vaccination is the cause of a sudden uptick in Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. They would instead decide that the above warrants further research. So we\u2019ve done that research for them. Public Health Scotland data reveals a 67% increase in the number of Young Adults suffering heart attacks Public Health Scotland (PHS) has a not very well known database presenting figures on the wider impact to the health service due to measures imposed in the name of Covid-19. The database is called \u2018COVID-19 wider impacts on the health care system\u2018. We analysed the data for cardiovascular cases across Scotland. Cardiovascular diseases are conditions that affect the structures or function of your heart, such as: For the \u2018out of hours\u2019 category, and the \u2018ambulance service\u2019 category, PHS provides a breakdown by age. Meaning we can assess the number of cardiovascular cases among adults aged 15 to 44. Here is how Public Health Scotland presents the data on the number of cases requiring out-of-hours care across Scotland \u2013 We extracted the data and produced a series of charts in order to present the figures provided by Public Health Scotland much more clearly and to attempt to understand the severity of what has been occurring since the introduction of the Covid-19 injections. The following chart shows the number of people aged 15-44 requiring out-of-hours treatment for cardiovascular cases per week from the week ending 4th July 2021 to the week ending 20th Feb 2022, as well as the 2018-2019 historical average per week among the same age group \u2013 The historical average shows that there have been anywhere from around 60 to just over 100 cardiovascular cases among 15 to 44-year-olds requiring out-of-hours treatment across Scotland. But the data for 2021 and 2022 shows that there have been anywhere from around 110 cases to 185 cardiovascular cases among 15 to 44-year-olds requiring out-of-hours treatment. So the number of cases have essentially doubled. The following chart shows the number of people aged 15-44 requiring an ambulance for cardiovascular cases per week from the week ending 4th July 2021 to the week ending 21st November 2021 (the most up to date data), as well as the 2018-2019 historical average per week among the same age group \u2013 The historical average shows that there have been anywhere from around 185 to just over 250 people aged 15-44 requiring an ambulance for cardiovascular cases per week across Scotland. But the data for 2021 and 2022 shows that there have been anywhere from around 290 cases to 390 people aged 15-44 requiring an ambulance for cardiovascular cases per week. So cases haven\u2019t quite doubled but they\u2019ve still increased quite dramatically. The following chart shows the percentage change in the number of people aged 15-44 requiring out-of-hours treatment for cardiovascular cases per week from the week ending 4th July 2021 to the week ending 20th Feb 2022, compared to the 2018-2019 historical average per week among the same age group \u2013 Here we can see that the number of cases requiring out-of-hours care has been higher throughout this entire period, ranging from a 35% increase in a single week to a staggering 117% increase in a single week compared to the historical average. The following chart shows the percentage change in the number of people aged 15-44 requiring an ambulance for cardiovascular cases per week from the week ending 4th July 2021 to the week ending 21st November 2021, compared to the historical 2018-2019 average per week among the same age group \u2013 Again we can see that the number of 15 to 44-year-olds requiring an ambulance has been higher than the historical average throughout the entire period, ranging from a 23% increase in a single week to an 82% increase compared to the historical average. So now we have two pieces of evidence that suggest Covid-19 vaccination is to blame for the sudden uptick in Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. Any doctor who became aware of this would now surely be extremely concerned. But if the above isn\u2019t enough to convince them then perhaps this third piece of evidence from NHS England is. Ambulance call-outs for Heart illness have Doubled since the beginning of the Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign The National Health Service has confirmed in response to a freedom of information request that ambulance call-outs relating to immediate care required for a debilitating condition affecting the heart nearly doubled in the whole of 2021 and are still on the rise further in 2022. But the most concerning published figures show that they have also doubled among people under the age of 30. On the 25th April 2022, Duncan Husband sent a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the West Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation trust requesting to know the following \u2013 The NHS responded on the 18th May with a spreadsheet containing the requested information. The following charts visualise the data contained in that spreadsheet \u2013 As we can see from the above two charts, ambulance call-ours for high conditions have been higher overall since January 2021, and have been increasing month on month. It was not until April 2021 that we saw a significant increase among people under the age of 30 though, and it again has increased month on month since then. The following chart shows the overall total call-outs by year for everyone and those aged 0 to 29 \u2013 The following chart shows the monthly average number of ambulance call-outs for conditions relating to the heart by year \u2013 There was a significant increase in 2021 among all age groups, and unfortunately, things got even worse in the first few months of 2022. Healthy young people are dying suddenly and unexpectedly from what doctors are dubbing \u201ca mysterious syndrome\u201d and these same doctors are now seeking answers through a new national register. But they need not call it \u201ca mysterious syndrome\u201d anymore because we have just proven the Covid-19 vaccine is to blame.

        "text":"Some of you, after thirty months of nuclear-grade media propaganda, are inclined to doubt everything that appears in the press. While journalists certainly circulate their share of falsehoods, lies are not their preferred strategy and almost always originate outside major press organs, with the self-serving statements of regime officials. The problem with lying, is that it\u2019s expensive and requires more coordination than widely distributed media operations command. Their preferred approach is rather one of emphasis. Regime-friendly reporters will scour the earth for every last story supporting government policies, and amplify these meagre items to the point of absurdity; at the same time, they\u2019ll do everything possible to ignore or downplay information injurious to their preferred narratives, however significant it might be. Now, it is generally all too apparent what the media have chosen to amplify. These are all the stories that you\u2019re absolutely sick to death of and that never seem to go away. It\u2019s a lot harder to work out all the things the press is currently burying, because absences are by their nature subtle things. Nevertheless, it is whatever the press is not saying, that is the most important of all. It\u2019s in this spirit that I draw your attention to how completely the earliest days of the pandemic have been memory-holed. Particularly the crucial months from January to March 2020 are almost never discussed, although this was the period of greatest dynamism and invention, when the vaccines were developed, mass testing inaugurated, longstanding pessimism about the efficacy of masking overturned, and novel, continent-wide house-arrests imposed upon hundreds of millions. You can glean some hint of the reasons for this nearly universal decision to ignore recent history from papers like this one, on The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy. Its authors delve into contact tracing data to find a total of 527 infections with symptom-onset dates preceding the celebrated 20 February 2020 diagnosis of Patient 1, Mattia Maestri, in Codogno. Maestri\u2019s positive test was held to be the beginning of the Italian outbreak, and back then, there was much speculation in the press about the identity of the mysterious Patient 0 from whom he had contracted SARS-2. And yet, as German and Italian public health officials traded accusations about where the first infections had really originated, contact tracers in Italy knew for a fact that Maestri was very far indeed from the origins of the European pandemic \u2013 closer to Patient 100,000 than to Patient 1. While there was still relatively little testing in those early days, the authors of our paper find evidence that, as of 20 February, \u201cSARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 municipalities\u201d in Lombardy, \u201cwith sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces.\u201d Still worse for Team Lockdown, the early pandemic, insofar as it admits of reconstruction, shows \u201cA decreasing trend in the net reproduction number \u2026 following the detection of the first case\u201d in February. The authors of the paper include public health officials and scientists from Lombardy, and they try to put a happy face on this awkward revelation, writing that \u201cearly interventions\u201d should receive credit for the \u201cmore marked\u201d decline in the effective reproduction number in Lodi (LO), Bergamo (BG) and Cremona (CR) from later February, and that specifically \u201cthe set-up of a quarantine area around the initial epicenter of the outbreak in the province of Lodi played a crucial role in controlling the infection locally.\u201d Yet, as even their supplementary table shows, there were no quarantines anywhere in Lodi until 24 February, maybe five days after the estimated R(t) peak there. The tepid early measures in Bergamo and Cremona, meanwhile, weren\u2019t imposed until 2 March, long after the observed growth in infections had entered its terminal decline in both regions. Another point emerges from this data, too. Look at that chart of provincial R(t). Yes, R(t) is declining in the big hot-spots, but where is it still increasing after the end of February? In Como (CO), Lecco (LC), Mantova (MN), Sondrio (SO) and Varese (VA). Now consider this heat map of infection incidence as of 9 March: The earliest reported infection, discovered in a preserved nasopharyngeal sample of a 4 year-old boy, happened before 21 November 2019 \u2013 in Milan (MI). By November at the latest, we can be confident that the virus was circulating in Milan. By the time of this map, though, the hot spots all appear to be in a roughly equidistant ring around Milan. By the end of February, the only places the virus is still accelerating, is in the still further outlying regions \u2013 places like Como, Mantova and Sondrio. It looks for all the world like the virus had burned through Milan without anybody noticing at all, and when the Tomas Pueyos of the world descended upon us with their mass testing and their lockdowns, they were a few months too late. The hotspots they found were secondary infection sites at best. By the time pandemicists started rooting through their bag of tricks, the virus had been circulating for months with nobody noticing. This is one of the most crucial and eagerly ignored facts of the whole pandemic. Those early patients were hospitalised at very high rates and \u2013 in accordance with Chinese advice \u2013 subjected to aggressive mechanical ventilation, which killed a great many of them. Maestri, Patient 1, was a 38 year-old recreational marathoner, and he probably would\u2019ve had far less trouble with SARS-2, had he not made the grave mistake of testing positive. Alas, he almost died after spending weeks on a ventilator. These are at least some of the reasons why our media and our public health officials are desperate to forget those early days. In March 2020, real infections were already in decline. The apparent surge in infection numbers was an illusion caused by the introduction of mass testing programs. Mass containment made everything worse.",

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Another 142 new cases of COVID-19 vaccine injuries to babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old were added to the U.S. Government run VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reported System) database today, bringing the total number of cases filed for this age group to 829 since the shots were authorized by the FDA a few weeks ago in June. (Source.) I have put all new 142 cases that came out today on a separate page you can view here. Brain and heart injuries, hallucinations, anaphylactic shock, seizures, skin rashes, gastrointestinal injuries, hemorrhaging, and other serious conditions continue to be listed as side effects to these toxic shots being injected into babies and toddlers. One of the most tragic things I am reading in these write-ups of vaccine injuries in these babies is that the parents and medical professionals are giving them acetaminophen (sold usually as Tylenol or Paracetamol) which study after study has shown is toxic and harmful to children. See: Here are a few cases showing how these poor children are suffering after receiving the shots. VAERS ID: 2397717, 2-year-old boy in Arizona: Life threatening episode requiring emergency transport: clammy skin and vomiting leading (8 minutes) to difficulty breathing (wheezing and flared nostrils-2 minutes). Turned blue, limp, non-responsive. Fully stopped breathing for two minutes. After several chest compressions started breathing again, rolled over, and threw up. VAERS ID: 2399256, 6-month-old boy in Virginia: (NOTE: In addition to the Pfizer COVID Shot, this poor baby also got at least 5 other vaccines injected into him at the same time!!) 07\/29\/2022 In the morning we had the vaccination and it was his six month check in. He also received other multiple vaccinations that day as well. We did notice spotting in his bowel movement of blood and there was one at 4 that evening. Another bowel movement at 7 that had much more blood in comparison. A third bowel movement around 12 that evening and the blood spots reduced as well. When we looked up his other vaccines and their symptoms they did state that it may have been a different vaccine\u201ds. The doctor stated that they believe the symptoms may be caused by lactose intolerance. Check-up in two weeks to see improvements. VAERS ID: 2393082, 4-year-old girl in Maine: 07\/25\/2020 Around 2:00 AM she woke up with a fever of 102 or 103 degree and vomiting. She slept until around 9:00 in the morning and still had a fever. I gave her acetaminophen. Throughout that day I treated her fever with Tylenol. Her temperature peaked that afternoon at 104 degrees. Tylenol made her fever go down. She woke up several times during the night. Around 1230am, she was hallucinating and very confused saying things that did not make sense. The next day she woke up around 7:30am. She also complained of neck pain. I gave her more Tylenol. I switched to Motrin around noon and that seemed to bring her fever down better. She went to her pediatrician\u201ds office that afternoon and was given a COVID test which was negative. Her doctor said everything looked good. Around 4 o\u201dclock her fever went up to 104 again. Her fever does respond to Tylenol and Motrin. She woke up this morning at 03:30 and had a temperature of 105.5. I gave her Motrin, put a cool washcloth on her. When she woke up at 7:30am this morning her temperature was at 100.4 and she appears to feel better, but am not sure if she is just responding to the medication. VAERS ID: 2393330, 4-year-old boy in Oklahoma: Child received COVID vaccine in Health department clinic on 07\/25\/22. Phone all from mom on 07\/27\/22 to report seizure on 07\/26\/22 at 7:00 am. Child transport to Hospital by ambulance. Temp was 100 upon arrival. Child spent the night at the hospital for \u201cmonitoring\u201d per mom. Per mom DX with \u201ccomplex febrile seizure\u201d. Mom called to report to health department . VAERS ID: 2393754, 10-month old girl in Maryland: Mother reported child had been crawling and pulling to stand for several weeks. Mother noticed in the evening of 7\/25\/2022 about 6 hours after vaccination child\u201ds mobility changed: crawled a few feet then just stopped crawling, flopped, spread her arms and legs out across the floor. She became inactive for a minute; then continued crawling, pulled to stand and then bear weight. Mother reported no fever no signs of discomfort but is concerned about possible neurological problems in her otherwise healthy child. Mother reports normal growth and development. Family is new to the area. They have an established MD. Will follow-up with an appointment 7\/28\/2022. VAERS ID: 2397646, 2-year-old girl in Pennsylvania: Suspected febrile seizure, fever, vomiting, spasms of muscles and then sever shaking\/chills for approximately 15 minutes. Transported to hospital by ambulance at approximately 1am. Discharged at 5:30am after monitoring. VAERS ID: 2399319, 2-year-old boy in Maryland: On July 31 about 49 hours after his second dose around 3pm, patient became very lethargic and started crying. We took his temperature and he had a 104.6. We gave him ibuprofen and put him down for a nap. He slept and when he woke up he had a 102. We gave him Tylenol at that time around 6:45pm. He seemed better and was okay the rest of the evening. Before bed he had a temp of 101 so we gave him ibuprofen. He slept about 13 hours. When he woke up on August 1, he was completely inconsolable. He had a 104.3 temp. He didn\u201dt want to eat but I was able to get him to eat a few pretzels. I gave him ibuprofen in the morning when he woke up after eating around 11:30am. He was inconsolable a lot of the day and only wanted to watch TV. He ate a very small lunch. I gave him tylenol at that point. His temp was better at 100. After his nap he was crying and didn\u201dt want a snack. We went for a walk outside in his stroller and that seemed to help a little. He did eat some dinner but would cry on and off throughout dinner. After dinner, he took a bath and he seemed okay then and the rest of the evening. Before bed, his temp was normal at 98.7. We gave him ibuprofen at that time. He slept 11 hours overnight and when he woke up on August 2nd, he was fussing but not hysterical. His temp in the morning was 99.1 but he started to feel warmer as the day went on. He had a smaller than normal breakfast and a very small lunch. He was crying on and off during lunch. I took his temp again and around 2:30 it was 102. I gave him ibuprofen around 2:30 and put him down for a nap. Overall, hes been better today (August 2) but is not back to normal. He did get bit by a goat on July 31 around 1:30. When I called my pediatrician, they didn\u201dt think his fever was related. They did prescribe him augmentin which he has been taking since August 1st VAERS ID: 2399458, 4-year-old boy in Pennsylvania: 4 days after vaccine patient developed acute ataxia. He was seen at Hospital and had an MRI that was read as normal. He was diagnosed with Cerebellar inflammation. VAERS ID: 2401711, 4-year-old boy in Indiana: This is part 2 to a previous report . My son spent 4 days in hospital was a fever and tachycardia. He is 4 years old about 33lbs and at times his heart rate was above 180. He had 4 days of fever and high heart rate. His second vaccination was on 7\/29\/2022. We went to ER first on 7\/ 30\/10\/22 he was treated for fever and giving Ibuprofen and heart rate monitored and then released: the very next day 7\/31\/2022 we had to go back to hospital due to fever (103) at hospital and high heart rate over 180. He was given ibuprofen, saline because he was not drinking much at that time duration of an hour and yet his heart rate did not decrease enough for discharge and he was admitted after 2:00am on 8\/1\/2022. He had several fevers between 8\/1\/2022-8\/2\/2022 and his heart rate slowly decreased but was still high and they continued to treat with ibuprofen and Tylenol interchangeably for fevers and monitor hear rate, he was given saline on 8\/2\/2022 after labs show n he had ketones in his urine from dehydration ( he was eating solids foods Or drinking water during this time. He was taken off of the saline on 8\/3\/2022 but still struggle to eat, fevers finally subsided and heart rate appeared to stabilize but his eating and drinking was still impacted and was kept an additional day for monitoring. He was released on 8\/5\/022 with recommendations to follow up with cardiologist and primary care doctor. Both were contacted. He saw pcp on 8\/4\/2022 and awaiting follow up appointment with cardiology to be scheduled by that office. COVID-19 Vaccines are Biggest Scam in History of Medicine, and the Children Suffer the Most As we have been reporting frequently for the past few weeks, many pro-vaccine and pro-pharma doctors and scientists are coming forward to sound the alarm on just how horrible these COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d are, and the death and carnage that has followed. A video has surfaced in the alternative media featuring an Israeli Professor, Dr. Zvika Granot, Ph.D., who is on the Faculty of Medicine at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He heads up the Granot Lab as the \u201cPrincipal Investigator,\u201d focusing on \u201cneutrophils\u201d and cancer research. He is also a member of The Public Emergency Council For The Covid19 Crisis in Israel, which is where this video apparently originated. Dr. Granot states: We have already seen many distortions of science, lies and half-truths during the COVID crisis. More than once we have seen aggressive policies based on hopes that lack a scientific basis presented to the public as scientific facts. We have seen how economic and political entities presented distorted science and silence many scientists who think differently. Approving vaccination for babies and toddlers by the FDA in the USA and by the Ministry of Health in Israel, breaks all records of the theater of the absurd and raises deep doubts about the conduct of the regulators in the USA and Israel. We have uploaded the video to our Bitchute, Odysee, and Telegram channels. CDC Backtracks on COVID Measures Less Than 2 Months After Recommending COVID Shots for Babies and Toddlers The truly tragic thing about this corruption within the FDA and the CDC, is that yesterday the CDC finally backtracked on many of their COVID-19 measures that are recommended, stating that the focus should now be on \u201cindividual decisions,\u201d and that \u201cunvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people.\u201d And, just like that, it was over. This is HUGE news folks. In Bureaucrat speak, this is a near-complete cave-in to the actual facts. No symptoms? No problem. Vaccinated or unvaccinated? Same guidance. Exposed? No need to even quarantine. Students exposed? They can stay in class, what the hell, right? If you managed to maintain your integrity through this awful period of time, congratulations! You are one of the rock stars of this story. You are a solid individual who has courage and stood firm and tall when it mattered most. As for the people who didn\u2019t, some can be forgiven. But many cannot. Those who could have and \u201cshould\u201d have known better? The doctors who failed to utilize known and proven early treatments to save lives? The public health authorities that locked people down and forced masks onto children\u2019s faces without a shred of supporting science to back those decisions? Medical hospital administrators who took the monetary bait and forced patients onto toxic and deadly regimens of Remdesivir and ventilators (again, without any supporting evidence!). The NIH treatment panel that still \u2013 to this day \u2013 does not recommend vitamin D, or any of the other actual safe and effective early treatments? Sorry, not sorry, those people need to suffer real and lasting public consequences. Some doctors should lose their licenses. Some bureaucrats need to lose their jobs while others need to go to trial. I feel most acutely for those who got caught up and suffered terribly as a result. I feel truly awful for all the people prevented from being at a loved one\u2019s passing, or who ,as a condition of continued employment, were coerced into getting Covid jabs they neither wanted nor needed. There are far too many tragic cases out there. Far too many young lives were lost and continue to be lost. I am angry that it happened and at the petty, ignorant bureaucrats who forced it to happen. \u201cSudden Adult Death Syndrome\u201d is a thing now, and the attempts to normalize it by the press have left me thinking that those companies and journalists who engaged in this ought to be barred for life from ever being in the business again. (Full article.) The statement \u201cunvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people,\u201d is, of course, a meaningless statement, because those unvaccinated with COVID shots (like myself), are unvaccinated specifically because we don\u2019t follow CDC \u201cguidance\u201d to begin with, but know how to research and think for ourselves. Why the CDC has done this about face is probably a matter of pure speculation, but I think the sheer number of pro-pharma and pro-vaccine doctors and scientists that have come forward in the public these past few weeks, must be a big part of it. Without these medical professionals on board, there is no one left to implement more COVID measures. This especially came to a head last month when LA County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brad Spellberg went public to humiliate Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer\u2019s announcement that COVID-19 cases were on the rise and new face mask mandates were needed soon. See: Without the support of the medical professionals still working in the hospitals, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer backed down on more mandates. See: And remember, it was the former head of the FDA under Donald Trump, who now sits on the board of directors for Pfizer and is a talking head \u201cexpert\u201d for CNBC, who addressed the public earlier this year back in February to explain why it was taking so long for Pfizer to come up with a COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d for young children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old: The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s plan to fast-track Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine for children under 5 years old was delayed because of a \u201clow number of cases overall in the clinical trial,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Monday. \u201cMost kids are not getting symptomatic Covid,\u201d said the current Pfizer board member and former head of the FDA. \u201cOne case in one direction or another can tip the perception of the vaccine\u2019s overall effectiveness.\u201d (Full article.) In other words, there just were not enough sick kids with COVID symptoms to complete the trials. But they ended up putting this product into the market in June anyway, and now the CDC is saying that unvaccinated people should be treated the same as vaccinated, after untold numbers of deaths and injuries, not to mention massive loss of employment due to the COVID-19 vaccine mandates, many of which are still in place. People need to be tried, convicted, and executed over this. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain. That work has been underway and the next step is for the FDA and CDC to review data from the companies, once they\u2019ve received it. The rollout was expected sometime in September, but Jha\u2019s estimate on Tuesday was the most specific to date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to know more about this in the upcoming weeks and these vaccines will become available by early to mid-September,\u201d Jha said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, again including the caveat that FDA and CDC need to act before anything can be official. \u201cBut the big picture, bottom line, is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd those vaccines are coming very, very soon.\u201d So far the U.S. has contracted for 105 million doses of the newly-updated boosters from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna, the two leading COVID vaccine manufacturers for the country. Both contracts with Pfizer and Moderna include an option for hundreds of millions of more doses down the line, should the U.S. secure the money. Between Pfizer and Moderna, if both companies were able to complete their orders, the U.S. would have about 171 million doses of the new shots. But more than 260 million Americans have had at least one vaccine dose already and would theoretically consider getting a booster. (Source.) The problem is that those who want COVID-19 vaccines are a dwindling market, partly because millions of people in the U.S. have now been crippled or have died after taking the vaccines for the past 20 months, according to the CDC and FDA\u2019s own statistics in the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS). There are more deaths and injuries following emergency-use authorized experimental COVID-19 vaccines in 20 months than have been recorded in VAERS for the previous 30 years following all FDA-approved vaccines. That\u2019s not a very good repeat business model, when so many of your patients are dying and becoming crippled. And it is estimated that only 1% of all vaccine injuries and deaths are reported to VAERS, which would put the number of Americans injured by a COVID-19 vaccine at around 138 million, with around 3 million deaths. The ABC report acknowledged that this is a dwindling market: \u2026 demand for boosters has dropped with each campaign for people to get another shot. About 108 million people have received their first booster shot, for example. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCOVID Data Tracker,\u201d 261,981,618 people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 107,872,738 people have received a first booster, and only 35,200,364 have received a second booster. This is a diminishing market, and I am quite sure that the majority of the 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses will probably never be used. Millions of doses of previous COVID vaccines have already been discarded due to lack of demand and exceeding their expiration dates, but that has not stopped Pfizer and Moderna from recording record profits, even when their vaccines don\u2019t sell and are thrown away. While new polls show flatlining concern about the pandemic among Americans, Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine business continues quietly churning in the background. But amid a recent decline in vaccine demand, the company has written off a sizable chunk of inventory. In its second-quarter results announcement, Moderna said it wrote off $499 million in inventories \u201crelated to COVID-19 products that have exceeded or are expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\u201d In addition, the company took a $184 million charge because of changes in prior purchase commitments, and it recorded an expense of $131 million for \u201cunutilized external manufacturing capacity.\u201d (Source.) Reducing the Population of the Earth is the Goal So why would Big Pharma continue with a product that is killing and injuring so many people, and significantly reducing their market among the pro-vaxxers? The answer, which should be obvious to all by now, at least for those who have refused the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d and can still think for themselves, is that this is part of a global plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d from climate change. Along with reducing the world\u2019s population is a plan that is currently in place, and can especially be seen in Holland right now, to dramatically reduce the world food production as well. Bill Gates is the Billionaire Globalist who has been pushing this agenda for decades now, and a report published in ZeroHedge News today also identifies Bill Gates as the primary influence behind the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d that was just recently put into law. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 which according to the Congressional Budget Office will raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $20 billion \u2013 not to mention unleash an army of IRS agents on working class Americans over the next decade, was made possible by Bill Gates and (in smaller part) Larry Summers, who have been known to hang out together. Pals hanging out The bill, of course, was signed yesterday. This is what dementia looks like: pic.twitter.com\/e9fof5l4RS \u2014 End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) August 16, 2022 In a Tuesday Bloomberg article that reads more like a newsletter for the Gates fan club, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder recalls how earlier this year, as moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema continued to block the tax-and-spend legislation over concerns that it would raise taxes on the middle class (it will), Gates says he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d been cultivating since at least 2019. Gates was banking on more than just his trademark optimism about addressing climate change and other seemingly intractable problems that have been his focus since stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive two decades ago. As he revealed to Bloomberg Green, he has quietly lobbied Manchin and other senators, starting before President Joe Biden had won the White House, in anticipation of a rare moment in which heavy federal spending might be secured for the clean-energy transition. Those discussions gave him reason to believe the senator from West Virginia would come through for the climate \u2014 and he was willing to continue pressing the case himself until the very end. \u201cThe last month people felt like, OK, we tried, we\u2019re done, it failed,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI believed it was a unique opportunity.\u201d So he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d cultivated for at least three years. \u201cWe were able to talk even at a time when he felt people weren\u2019t listening.\u201d -Bloomberg We know, gag us with a spoon. Apparently Gates and Manchin\u2019s bromance began when the billionaire wooed the West Virgina Senator at a 2019 meal in Seattle, in an effort to garner support for clean-energy policy. Manchin at the time was the senior-most Democrat on the energy committee. \u201cMy dialogue with Joe has been going on for quite a while,\u201d said Gates. After Manchin walked (again) on the bill last December over concerns that it would exacerbate the national debt, inflation, the pandemic, and amid geopolitical uncertainty with Russia, Gates jumped into action. A few weeks later, he met with Manchin and his wife, Gayle Conelly Manchin, at a DC restaurant, where they talked about what West Virginia needed. Manchin understandably wanted to preserve jobs at the center of the US coal industry, while Gates suggested that coal plant workers could simply swap over to nuclear plants \u2013 such as those from Gates\u2019 TerraPower. Manchin apparently wasn\u2019t convinced, announcing on Feb. 1 that \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d (the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s previous iteration) was \u201cdead.\u201d In an effort to convince him otherwise, Democrats pulled together a cadre of economists and other Manchin influencers \u2013 including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who convinced Manchin that the bill wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, or add to the deficit. Collin O\u2019Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation, recruited economists to assuage Manchin\u2019s concerns \u2014 including representatives from the University of Chicago and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware brought in a heavyweight: former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who has spent decades advising Democrats. The economists were able to \u201csend this signal that [the bill\u2019s] going to help with the deficit,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slightly deflationary and it\u2019s going to spur growth and investment in all these areas.\u201d Through this subtle alchemy, clean-energy investments could be reframed for Manchin as a hedge against future spikes in oil and gas prices and a way to potentially export more energy to Europe. -Bloomberg Gates also sprang into action again on July 7, when Manchin was spotted at the Sun Valley media conference in Idaho \u2013 which Gates also attended. \u201cWe had a talk about what was missing, what needed to be done,\u201d Gates said. \u201cAnd then after that it was a lot of phone calls.\u201d Gates looks back at the new law with satisfaction. He achieved what he set out to do. \u201cI will say that it\u2019s one of the happier moments of my climate work,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI have two things that excite me about climate work. One is when policy gets done well, and this is by far the biggest moment like that.\u201d His other pleasure comes from interviewing people at climate and clean-tech startups: \u201cI hear about this amazing new way to make steel, cement and chemicals.\u201d -Bloomberg \u201cI don\u2019t want to take credit for what went on,\u201d says Gates \u2013 in the article about how he gets credit for what went on.

        "text":"How the Monkeypox Scam Mirrors the COVID Scam\u2013unbelievable by Meryl Nass, MD Substack The vaccine does not prevent infection Just like the COVID vaccines, turns out that in the animal experiments, Jynneos did not stop monkeys getting monkeypox, but did stop them from dying. Since the current strain of monkeypox is mild, and virtually no one dies from monkeypox, this is another reason to avoid these dangerous vaccines like the plague\u2014they won\u2019t stop the infection! According to the CDC \u2018s briefing to its advisory committee on June 23, which I attended, this is generally a mild disease, requires no specific treatment, and the people who were hospitalized were hospitalized for pain control. (For example, perirectal lesions can induce painful sphincter spasms.) So, in terms of deaths, in 2022 there are now a total of 5 deaths that have been associated with Moneypox reported outside Africa, and 4 reported from Nigeria. I found only two for which there was discussion of cause of death: the Brazilian had lymphoma (lymph cancer), and the person from Peru died of a preexisting condition. We know nothing about what killed the other seven. CDC has been hiding its vaccine study of 1600 Congolese healthcare workers CDC began a study of the Jynneos vaccine in the DRC in 2017 and finished recruiting by September 2020, according to the required notification in ClinicalTrials.gov. The idea was to vaccinate people most susceptible to monkeypox and see how many got monkeypox, and what the side effects were. CDC has a lot of data, and the person who briefed the advisory committee on June 23, Brett Peterson, is the Principal Investigator of this Congo trial. Where is CDC\u2019s briefing on this study\u2019s results? This was the first study of vaccine efficacy in the world\u2014why is CDC being coy about the results? The same 2 scientists who hyped COVID\u2019s natural origin now hyping Monkeypox\u2019 natural origin Two of the same scientists who hyped the natural origin of COVID are now trying to explain the excessive number of mutations in the current Moneypox variant, which appears to be derived from a strain isolated in labs in 3 countries in 2018-9. Double-stranded DNA viruses don\u2019t usually mutate this fast\u2026since we have a 2018 start date, the mutations expected could be calculated. A lot of the mutations could have been induced by an enzyme used in labs. See DoorlessCarp\u2019s June 5 update for more on the science. The two people are Andrew Rambaut and Michael Worobey. Rambaut was one of the 5 authors of the Nature Medicine article that Tony Fauci caused to be written, to cover up the lab origin that Fauci himself funded. Worobey just published an article claiming\u2014despite everything\u2014that COVID came from nature. Now they are doing the same for Monkeypox. https:\/\/virological.org\/t\/initial-observations-about-putative-apobec3-deaminase-editing-driving-short-term-evolution-of-mpxv-since-2017\/830 https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/06\/02\/health\/monkeypox-endemic-silent-spread\/index.html US Government has created a fake shortage of vaccine Well yes, of course, they always do that to fan the flames of demand. But this is a lot bigger than that. The USG already owns 16 million doses, stored frozen in Denmark, and had spent well over $1 Billion on Jynneos vaccines before Moneypox was identified in the west. Despite the Denmark factory\u2019s \u201cfill and finish\u201d facility being completed in 2021, and despite the USG allotting $44 million for \u201cqualification\u201d of that same facility in January 2019, the FDA only got around to finishing its inspection on July 27, 2022. Supposedly this prevented the US from getting its hands on any of its supply stored overseas. Duh? And the USG ordered 1.4 million doses as recently as 2020, yet to be delivered. Meantime, President Biden asked for another $7 Billion for the $Moneypox emergency. No wonder they plan to change the name of Moneypox, which is said to be stigmatizing to Africans. They mislead. It is stigmatizing to politicians. Because of the vaccine shortage, existing vaccine will get a liability waiver How sweet is that? Jynneos is licensed, and is being used for its labelled indication (prevention of Moneypox) so the manufacturer is liable for injuries. The USG might also be liable, if it steered you wrong about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine\u2026or if it hid a study it had conducted, for example. But since we have a shortage, the USG in its benevolence and wisdom is going to dilute it and give recipients instead a 20% dose, administered intradermally instead of subcutaneously. But in order to make this kosher (kosher for whom?) the DHHS and FDA are issuing the vaccine an emergency use authorization, and we all know what that means. You can\u2019t sue anybody even if the vaccine kills you. You can apply to DHHS for small benefits from its Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, but you might be waiting a long time for an answer. The program has denied about 95% of petitioners, and no one has received a payout for a COVID vaccine injury yet. This also means that a USG contractor will now be inserted between the Danish manufacturer and the recipient. I wonder what diluent the USG will instruct them to add, or supply itself, for that matter? Read the full article here. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.

        "text":"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The biggest lie that has been perpetrated in modern medicine is that \u201cthe science is settled\u201d when it comes to the issue of vaccines, and that all vaccines are \u201csafe and effective.\u201d We have been exposing this lie for over a decade now, combating the lies with REAL data and truth, such as comparing the health outcomes of children whose parents followed the CDC vaccine schedule and injected their children with all the recommended vaccines, with those parents who decided to not vaccinate their children. This is, by far, the most scientific way to determine if vaccines, ANY vaccine, is \u201csafe and effective.\u201d But such studies have never been conducted by the federal government and their alphabet \u201chealth\u201d agencies such as the FDA, CDC, NIH, etc. And when others privately conduct such studies, these federal bureaucratic medical tyrants do everything they can to discredit and vilify those conducting such studies, to prevent the public from having this information. Here are some previous articles we have published on this topic: Families who suffer from vaccine injuries to their children, and as a result then decide to not vaccinate future children that they have, also become homes in which the health outcomes of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children can be observed. So it should not surprise us at all that the current medical authorities have no desire whatsoever to compare the health outcomes of people who have been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccines with those who have not. This is information that they do NOT want to be disseminated to the public. Steve Kirsch has just published a very revealing article about two groups of people he has studied that contain both people vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines and those who were not, comprising a sample of about 800 people, 200 of which attended a wedding about 8 months ago, and about 600 people who responded to a survey he published. The results of his analysis: In the year after you are vaccinated with the COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d you are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die expect at least a 7% rate of serious injury and a 2% chance of death It is this kind of data the CDC and FDA do NOT want disseminated to the public, and is being heavily censored. You are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die if you get the COVID shot When you combine this result with negative vaccine efficacy, the COVID shots are completely nonsensical. Nobody should take them. We couldn\u2019t find a single supportive anecdote! by Steve Kirsch Substack Executive summary I recently learned about conservative radio show host Wayne Root\u2019s stunning anecdotal evidence about the 200 people who attended his wedding. He tracked what happened just 8 months after the wedding: 26 were injured and 7 died in the vaccinated group but nothing happened to people in the unvaccinated group, even though Wayne estimated that most of the guests were unvaccinated. I loved the setup: it\u2019s an almost \u201cas good as it gets real-life randomized trial.\u201d A single anecdote isn\u2019t compelling. What is compelling is that others are observing the same huge event rates. Wayne is hardly an outlier. And the fact we can\u2019t seem to find any stories equally extreme on the opposite side has got to be very troubling for those supporting the \u201csafe and effective\u201d narrative. This is the type of post-marketing research the CDC should be doing: they should follow matched (or randomly selected) groups of vaxxed and unvaxxed people over time to document injuries and deaths just like Wayne did. If Wayne can do this, why can\u2019t the CDC? The signal is huge. Since none of Wayne\u2019s friends died pre-vaccine (Wayne is 61), this suggests that hypotheses such as this one are consistent with what Wayne observed: In the year after you are vaccinated with the COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d you are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die expect at least a 7% rate of serious injury and a 2% chance of death would be consistent with Wayne\u2019s observations. I validated that Wayne\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t just a fluke with surveys of my reader base. Over 600 readers responded and the numbers were very similar: 21 injuries and 5 deaths per 100 vaccinated, which is very close to the numbers reported by Wayne (assuming he had an even mix of vaxxed\/unvaxxed guests). An article on The Expose just claimed that 1 in every 246 Vaccinated People has died within 60 days of Covid-19 Vaccination in England according to the UK Government which is a factor of 5 lower than my hypothesis, but that\u2019s just limited to the first 60 days after a single dose. And then I went even further looking for anecdotal evidence that Wayne was wrong. I asked my 50,000 followers on Gab for opposite anecdotes. None of the 372 people had an anecdote supporting use of the vaccine. Stunning. When you combine this with the evidence of negative vaccine efficacy (VE), such as this article on San Diego by my good friend Mathew Crawford, we are left with the inevitable conclusion that there isn\u2019t any benefit at all in any dimension to support the use of the COVID \u201cvaccines.\u201d I invite all fact checkers to: Verify my data. The survey data, including the full contact info for each of the 600 respondents, is available for any fact checker to verify. Do their own survey. Mine was done in full public view. Explain why nobody I asked knew of any positive anecdotes. When you combine all of this with the fact that The COVID vaccines kill people at a rate that is 1,000X times higher than the Smallpox vaccine (which is deemed too unsafe to use), it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that the \u201cvaccines\u201d should be stopped immediately.

Gates was banking on more than just his trademark optimism about addressing climate change and other seemingly intractable problems that have been his focus since stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive two decades ago. As he revealed to Bloomberg Green, he has quietly lobbied Manchin and other senators, starting before President Joe Biden had won the White House, in anticipation of a rare moment in which heavy federal spending might be secured for the clean-energy transition. Those discussions gave him reason to believe the senator from West Virginia would come through for the climate \u2014 and he was willing to continue pressing the case himself until the very end. \u201cThe last month people felt like, OK, we tried, we\u2019re done, it failed,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI believed it was a unique opportunity.\u201d So he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d cultivated for at least three years. \u201cWe were able to talk even at a time when he felt people weren\u2019t listening.\u201d -Bloomberg We know, gag us with a spoon.

A few weeks later, he met with Manchin and his wife, Gayle Conelly Manchin, at a DC restaurant, where they talked about what West Virginia needed. Manchin understandably wanted to preserve jobs at the center of the US coal industry, while Gates suggested that coal plant workers could simply swap over to nuclear plants \u2013 such as those from Gates\u2019 TerraPower.

        "link":"https:\/\/medicalkidnap.com\/2022\/08\/17\/white-house-orders-171-million-doses-of-new-boosters-for-the-pro-vaxxers-still-alive-as-covid-19-vaccine-market-dwindles\/",
        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain. That work has been underway and the next step is for the FDA and CDC to review data from the companies, once they\u2019ve received it. The rollout was expected sometime in September, but Jha\u2019s estimate on Tuesday was the most specific to date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to know more about this in the upcoming weeks and these vaccines will become available by early to mid-September,\u201d Jha said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, again including the caveat that FDA and CDC need to act before anything can be official. \u201cBut the big picture, bottom line, is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd those vaccines are coming very, very soon.\u201d So far the U.S. has contracted for 105 million doses of the newly-updated boosters from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna, the two leading COVID vaccine manufacturers for the country. Both contracts with Pfizer and Moderna include an option for hundreds of millions of more doses down the line, should the U.S. secure the money. Between Pfizer and Moderna, if both companies were able to complete their orders, the U.S. would have about 171 million doses of the new shots. But more than 260 million Americans have had at least one vaccine dose already and would theoretically consider getting a booster. (Source.) The problem is that those who want COVID-19 vaccines are a dwindling market, partly because millions of people in the U.S. have now been crippled or have died after taking the vaccines for the past 20 months, according to the CDC and FDA\u2019s own statistics in the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS). There are more deaths and injuries following emergency-use authorized experimental COVID-19 vaccines in 20 months than have been recorded in VAERS for the previous 30 years following all FDA-approved vaccines. That\u2019s not a very good repeat business model, when so many of your patients are dying and becoming crippled. And it is estimated that only 1% of all vaccine injuries and deaths are reported to VAERS, which would put the number of Americans injured by a COVID-19 vaccine at around 138 million, with around 3 million deaths. The ABC report acknowledged that this is a dwindling market: \u2026 demand for boosters has dropped with each campaign for people to get another shot. About 108 million people have received their first booster shot, for example. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCOVID Data Tracker,\u201d 261,981,618 people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 107,872,738 people have received a first booster, and only 35,200,364 have received a second booster. This is a diminishing market, and I am quite sure that the majority of the 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses will probably never be used. Millions of doses of previous COVID vaccines have already been discarded due to lack of demand and exceeding their expiration dates, but that has not stopped Pfizer and Moderna from recording record profits, even when their vaccines don\u2019t sell and are thrown away. While new polls show flatlining concern about the pandemic among Americans, Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine business continues quietly churning in the background. But amid a recent decline in vaccine demand, the company has written off a sizable chunk of inventory. In its second-quarter results announcement, Moderna said it wrote off $499 million in inventories \u201crelated to COVID-19 products that have exceeded or are expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\u201d In addition, the company took a $184 million charge because of changes in prior purchase commitments, and it recorded an expense of $131 million for \u201cunutilized external manufacturing capacity.\u201d (Source.) Reducing the Population of the Earth is the Goal So why would Big Pharma continue with a product that is killing and injuring so many people, and significantly reducing their market among the pro-vaxxers? The answer, which should be obvious to all by now, at least for those who have refused the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d and can still think for themselves, is that this is part of a global plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d from climate change. Along with reducing the world\u2019s population is a plan that is currently in place, and can especially be seen in Holland right now, to dramatically reduce the world food production as well. Bill Gates is the Billionaire Globalist who has been pushing this agenda for decades now, and a report published in ZeroHedge News today also identifies Bill Gates as the primary influence behind the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d that was just recently put into law. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 which according to the Congressional Budget Office will raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $20 billion \u2013 not to mention unleash an army of IRS agents on working class Americans over the next decade, was made possible by Bill Gates and (in smaller part) Larry Summers, who have been known to hang out together.

        "text":"\u201cwell-fitted\u201d and \u201cof a high quality. And the two we know are high-quality are an N95 or a KN95.\" Right now, we are very, very clear that masks do work in prevention of acquisition and transmission, but you\u2019ve got to get a well-fitted mask that has \u2014 of a high quality. And the two we know are high-quality are an N95 or a KN95.\u201d I knew these vaccines(sic) were not going to protect against infection. Having had long and contentious battles with people over mask and vaccine efficacy I believe some apologies are due.Whenever you're ready, we're here to accept them.It's an outright lie that they didn't know this. There was never any preponderance of evidence that a cloth mask did anything. It was a lie. I won't even address that he's also lying about \"aquisition\" in this statement, they don't \"know\" anything.Like the rest of the crumbling narrative it's becoming clear they sold you lies packaged as science and are now claiming things like their policies were based on \"hope\" or, like Fauci here, act confused that various government agencies pushed policy based on his own statements. They never spoke out about mask mandates. They actively tried to suppress any challenge to their lies. This is fraud, it's weaponization of government against citizens, and it needs to be addressed.Fauci is surprised the messages were mixed and response was poor, but he was the one in charge of the messaging. His desire for fame and adulation forced him to violate the rules of public health messaging and he ran in front of every camera he could find to spew his verbal diarrhea over the airwaves.Dr Birx has admitted that she didn't believe vaccines were effective and admits to manipulating the public. This removes the ability for test subjects in the COVID immune system therapeutic trials, still ongoing, to enter under the rules of informed consent. You were all lied to, knowingly, by the people you defended at the cost of your own reputations.She knew this and has pushed for vaccination anyway. The CDC still is pushing this on children who, prior to the immune system therapy being introduced, had almost no risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID. These are facts.For those esteemed COVID and science experts, let me explain. Healthy children did not get seriously ill or die from COVID in any significant numbers. Birx has claimed she wanted to ignore efficacy disclosures because the vaccine still prevented hospitalization and death. Children were at almost no risk of this. She manipulated the public into believing that vaccinating their children was effective and, more egregiously, that it had any benefit to their children that exceeded the risk.She needs to be tried and she deserves to spend the remainder of her life in prison.They have admitted to promoting a vaccine they knew is not effective against transmission to a demographic that they admit, through their own public statements, provides almost no benefit while also introducing unknown risk. This is criminal. It violates medical ethics. They have done real harm to children who experience a diminished ability to fight infection as the spike producing therapy loses efficacy, before we account for adverse effect at all. It's an egregious violation of the public trust.There is no longer any excuse for you to be defending these people, not that you'll stop because you are driven by politics. You have never listened to science nor actual experts. You have listened to myths. You are faithful followers of the church of science as preached by globalist interests and greedy corporations.You can post your lamentations here. You can post your apologies here. You can post your rage at me for telling you this for two years here.And as I know you'll do, you can post your deflections and excuses here too. You may want to review your post history and signature blocks before you do. You may have forgotten what was said. ATS doesn't.No amount of explaining can explain around that they lied knowingly about an alleged public health emergency and by doing so it resulted in children taking an unnecessary vaccine that is currently cited to have a risk of 1 in 5,000 of causing a potentially fatal cardiac condition. IN CHILDREN. This is only one of several dozen known adverse effects of the ineffective immune system therapeutic which, to this day, is still only available as manufactured under an emergency use agreement. Now they need to investigate the fraud that enabled an emergency use approval for this ineffective and potentially dangerous toxin across the entire population. Yes, an injection that does not provide a medical benefit and has deleterious effects is defined as a toxin. They have injected a toxin into children intentionally. The have now admitted it.If you are a rat, it might be time to start abandoning ship. History is not going to be kind.You were warned. We walked you through the science tirelessly. We showed you evidence. We pointed out the inconsistencies and the hypocrisy. We told you the financial repercussions. We all collectively cried foul when the children became targets. We endured the ill will and the persecution because we actually care about children we'll never meet. Now, because you refused to listen to anybody except your political operatives, many children will never live to be adults. We tried to help the people that wanted us censored. We did it for two years and you spit in our faces. Millions of people are suffering, many millions more will.It's time for change. You can be a participant in bringing about this change or you can be a target of those that are. Science is going to win.",

        "text":"Share this... It\u2019s really hard to believe it\u2019s happening \u2013 today \u2013 in Europe. Germany returns to darkness. Police randomly target, pick off peaceful demonstrators and strollers. Symbol photo. Source: Freie Niedersachsen As Germany scrambles to stifle the growing grassroots movement against COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates, authorities are resorting to ever more extreme tactics to snuff out the people\u2019s right to dissent. One retired German professor recounts his own experience. =========================== By Prof. Dr. Stefan Homburg Originally published at Reitschuster.de [Hanover] Yesterday, the Monday after New Year\u2019s Day, 2022, I wanted to watch for the first time one of the \u201cwalks\u201d now taking place by the thousands all over Germany as the authorities have banned demonstrations. I know from the newspaper that the police have issued a general order on FFP2 masks to make it easier to take tougher action against walkers. The medical bogus arguments are no longer used, so I put a mask in my pocket. At the Town Hall, the designated meeting place, I can only see a huge police contingent. I stroll alone to the state parliament, where a large group of people are being detained and requested to assign a leader of the meeting. I stay away from that and continue to Hanover\u2019s Kr\u00f6pcke central square, where on this mild January evening several hundred people can be found, most of them on their way to or from the shops. Keeping an eye out for possible walkers, I stop for a moment and a lady standing next to me abruptly says she hasn\u2019t been downtown for ages because of lockdowns and masks. As I feel the same way, we admire the Christmas decorations together for half a minute. As I want to move on, there are suddenly five police officers in front of us and, as I turn around, about ten to fifteen behind us, forming a ring around the lady, myself and maybe eight other, mostly older people. Asked what this means, a blonde policewoman answers me that she hereby declares us an [illegal] assembly. I immediately put on my FFP2 mask, am honestly shocked and reply that this is probably a civic prank. As a result of the police presence and the crowd that has formed, there are now many spectators in the square, and basically any group of people could be surrounded from behind and declared an \u201cassembly\u201d. An acquaintance who happens to be passing by wants to join me, but she is not allowed into police-surrounded group, and I am not allowed out. More and more police officers arrive, also spectators, and the whole scene is getting filmed many times over. I also receive shouts from people who recognize me and express their surprise at this strange measure. The term \u201cfascism\u201d gets used, and the police officers are verbally attacked harshly by the bystanders. After about a quarter of an hour, things get serious: I am taken away by three men, and when I ask what I am accused of, I get the answer: violation of the obligation to wear a mask. I reply that I am wearing one, even FFP2, and have been since the group formed. But it is of no use: I should have been wearing the mask before the group formed, and that they have photos to prove that this was not the case. Now that I am away from the others, I only notice out of the corner of my eye that the others who are not wearing masks are far worse off. Maybe because they just wanted to walk through the city and for that reason didn\u2019t have one with them. In any case, I hear commotion and screams, but as a detained person I cannot investigate. After taking my personal details, the police tell me that proceedings will be taken against me and that I am banished from the entire city center. Yet, the police officer in charge is unable to define the boundaries of the area. Instead, he threatens me with imprisonment in case of a violation. Two conclusions Firstly, the police can, through underhanded singling out, pin a case on anyone who is outside their home, and that is probably the point of the action. Secondly, if this cannot be called fascism, where does it actually begin \u2013 or to put it another way, what more do we actually want to put up with?

        "title":"CDC Admits It Gave False Information About COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.zerohedge.com\/medical\/cdc-admits-it-gave-false-information-about-covid-19-vaccine-surveillance",
        "text":"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is admitting it gave false information about COVID-19 vaccine surveillance, including inaccurately saying it conducted a certain type of analysis over one year before it actually did. A general view of the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta on April 23, 2020. (Tami Chappell\/AFP via Getty Images) The false information was conveyed in responses to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the results of surveillance, and after the CDC claimed COVID-19 vaccines are being monitored \u201cby the most intense safety monitoring efforts in U.S. history.\u201d \u201cCDC has revisited several FOIA requests and as a result of its review CDC is issuing corrections for the following information,\u201d a CDC spokeswoman told The Epoch Times in an email. No CDC employees intentionally provided false information and none of the false responses were given to avoid FOIA reporting requirements, the spokeswoman said. Heart Inflammation The Epoch Times in July submitted a FOIA, or a request for non-public information, to the CDC for all reports from a team that was formed to study post-vaccination heart inflammation by analyzing reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a system run by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The CDC not only said that the team did not conduct any abstractions or reports through October 2021, but that \u201can association between myocarditis and mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was not known at that time.\u201d That statement was false. Clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines detected neither myocarditis nor pericarditis, two types of heart inflammation. But by April 2021, the U.S. military was raising the alarm about post-vaccination heart inflammation, and by June 2021, the CDC was publicly acknowledging a link. The CDC previously corrected the false statement but did not say whether its teams had ever analyzed VAERS reports. \u201cIn reference to myocarditis abstraction from VAERS reports\u2014this process began in May 2021 and continues to this date,\u201d the CDC spokeswoman said in an email. The CDC has still not released the results of analyses. Data Mining The CDC promised in January 2021 that it would perform a specific type of data mining analysis on VAERS reports called Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR). But when Children\u2019s Health Defense, a nonprofit, asked for the results, the CDC said that \u201cno PRRs were conducted by the CDC\u201d and that data mining \u201cis outside of th[e] agency\u2019s purview.\u201d Asked for clarification, Dr. John Su, who heads the CDC\u2019s VAERS team, told The Epoch Times in an email that the CDC started performing PRRs in February 2021, \u201cand continues to do so to date.\u201d The CDC is now saying that both the original response and Su\u2019s statement were false. The agency didn\u2019t start performing PRRs until March 25, 2022, the CDC spokeswoman said. The agency stopped performing them on July 31, 2022. The spokeswoman said it \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d both Children\u2019s Health Defense and The Epoch Times. Children\u2019s Health Defense had asked for the PRRs the CDC had performed from Feb. 1, 2021, through Sept. 30, 2021. The Epoch Times asked if the response to the request was correct. The spokeswoman said the CDC thought \u201cdata mining\u201d referred only to Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining, a different type of analysis that the Food and Drug Administration has promised to perform on VAERS data. \u201cThe notion that the CDC did not realize we were asking about PRRs but only data mining in general is simply not credible, since our FOIA request specifically mentioned PRRs and their response also mentioned that they did not do PRRs. They did not say \u2018data mining in general,'\u201d Josh Guetzkow, a senior lecturer at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem who has been working with Children\u2019s Health Defense, told The Epoch Times via email. \u201cThere is also no credible reason why they waited until March 31, 2022, to calculate PRRs, unless it was in response to our initial FOIA filed in December 2021, which was rejected on March 31, 2022\u2014the same day they say they began their calculations. It means the CDC was not analyzing VAERS for early warning safety signals for well over a year after the vaccination campaign began\u2014which still counts as a significant failure,\u201d he added.

        "text":"Nurses Who Left the Health Care System to Focus on Early Treatment Describe \u2018Brutal\u2019 COVID-19 Treatment Protocols The protocols require 'mind-blowing cognitive dissonance' Nurses who witnessed \u201cbrutal\u201d hospital COVID-19 treatment protocols kill patients paint a bleak picture of what is taking place in state and federally funded health care systems. \u201cThey\u2019re horrific, and they\u2019re all in lockstep,\u201d Staci Kay, a nurse practitioner with the North Carolina Physicians for Freedom who left the hospital system to start her own early treatment private practice, told The Epoch Times. \u201cThey will not consider protocols outside of what\u2019s given to them by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the NIH (National Institute of Health). And nobody is asking why.\u201d Fueled by cognitive dissonance amid an array of red flags, Kay said hospital staff is ignoring blatantly problematic treatments that performed poorly in clinical trials, such as remdesivir, and protocols such as keeping the patient isolated, just to adhere to the federal canon. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people die with their family watching via iPad on Facetime,\u201d Kay said. \u201cIt was brutal.\u201d As a former nurse in intensive care, Kay said she had seen her share of tragedy, but how she saw COVID patients being treated \u201chad me waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat with chest pains.\u201d \u201cI hated my job,\u201d Kay said. \u201cI hated going to work. I was stressed in a way I\u2019ve never been before in my entire life.\u201d Keeping families isolated was especially difficult, she said, because people couldn\u2019t come to say goodbye to their loved ones. \u2018We Can Do Better\u2019 Kay was looking for other options when she found an inpatient protocol designed Dr. Paul Marik, founding member of Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, which purported to have a 94 percent success rate. However, after Kay pitched it to the head of the pulmonary critical care department, she was dismissed, and the physician boasted that the hospital had a 66 percent survival rate at the time. \u201cI told him, \u2018I feel like we can do better,\u2019 but I was very quickly shut down,\u201d Kay said. \u201cI became very angry because I\u2019m watching people die and I knew we could have been doing better.\u201d It was as if formerly smart people had become brainwashed, \u201cand then just dumb,\u201d Kay said, lacking the mental wherewithal to discern true from false. This led Kay to begin treating patients in the outpatient setting to prevent their admission into the hospital system, which is now her full-time job after being fired for not submitting to what she described as illogical testing requirements for those who weren\u2019t vaccinated. At her telemedicine business, Kay said she\u2019s seeing multiple cases of people suffering from COVID-19 vaccine injuries. \u201cI saw things on the inpatient side, too, that I suspected were vaccine injuries that went unacknowledged by our physicians,\u201d Kay said. \u201cI saw brain bleeds, seizures out of nowhere, cancer that just spread like wildfire, ischemic strokes, and I saw one person die horrifically from myocarditis.\u201d On the outpatient side, she said she\u2019s seen conditions resulting from the COVID-19 vaccine such as brain fog, cognitive decline, joint pain, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and neuropathy, which is numbness and tingling in hands, feet, and extremities. \u2018The Old School Becomes The New School\u2019 Kay\u2019s business, Sophelina Counseling, provides telemedicine, mobile urgent care, and mobile IV therapies. It\u2019s independent of corporate, federal, and state control, which she said is a solution to a health care system paralyzed with oppressive requirements. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s corporate control over medicine, whether it\u2019s Medicare or private insurance companies, you\u2019re always going to have providers who are forced, pressured, and coerced to do things that they wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d she said. \u201cPhysicians don\u2019t have the treatment they used to have.\u201d Because of this corporate control, Kay said the list of boxes they must check takes time away from the actual patient. \u201cGetting away from this corporate structure is going to be a game changer,\u201d she said. Kay advocated for returning to the \u201cold school\u201d way, which is the direct, primary care model, in which the patient pays a monthly or annual fee to have access to the provider without the interference of a traditional insurance company that requires \u201ctoo many hoops to jump through, headaches, and checkboxes.\u201d Kay points to a health care model called GoldCare, designed by Dr. Simone Gold, founder of America\u2019s Frontline Doctors. Gold, who was sentenced to two months in prison for her alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 breach of the Capitol, created GoldCare as a private membership association (PMA). Because much of what insurance companies do revolves around potential lawsuits, to be a member of the PMA, one must sign a clause, agreeing that they won\u2019t sue. \u201cWhat that does for us is we don\u2019t have to order unnecessary testing or consults just to cover our back end because that\u2019s most of what corporate medicine does,\u201d she said. As a result, Kay said, both the patient and the physician are happier because the treatment process hasn\u2019t been weighted down with bloated insurance requirements. For Kay, this model\u2014an evocation of a simpler time in medical care when doctors were more connected with their patients\u2014is key. \u201cThe old school is going to have to become the new school,\u201d Kay said. NIH and the CDC did not respond to The Epoch Times\u2019 request for comment on COVID-19 treatment protocols. Boycotting the System Having taken salmon, eggs, and honey for payment, a nurse in Washington state who wished to remain anonymous shares Kay\u2019s more traditional vision for the future of health care. She told The Epoch Times that people \u201cneed to boycott their health insurance.\u201d \u201cI think people who don\u2019t need surgery to save their life should not go to the hospital,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cI think people need to find doctors who are private pay and pay for only what they need to be done.\u201d The federal government must be removed from the health care equation, she added. \u201cI especially don\u2019t think any children should be going to these practitioners who are accepting state funding or Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements,\u201d the nurse said The nurse requested anonymity because\u2014in addition to being unvaccinated\u2014in Washington and Oregon state, she said the government has made it possible for the public to submit anonymous complaints, \u201cdevoid of evidence,\u201d against health care workers who promote treatments that deviate from the official protocols. After the nurse was fired for not complying with the vaccine mandate, she started her own private care business that offers monoclonal antibodies, L-lysine and vitamin C infusions, infrared red light therapy, and nebulizer machines as treatments as needed and when indicated. \u2018Widespread Data Suppression\u2019 With her newly launched business, she performed the early interventions that she said hospitals should be doing, \u201cbut refuse to do because they say there\u2019s no evidence for it.\u201d The nurse works with a growing network of physicians and providers that function as a \u201ctotal parallel society\u201d existing in the shadows beside the \u201ccrooked\u201d health care system, she said. In the aftermath of the public vaccine campaign in her community, the nurse said she saw an increase in strokes and embolization procedures as doctors engaged in \u201cwidespread data suppression,\u201d such as not reporting to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System what she saw as vaccine injuries and deaths and recording non-COVID deaths to be caused by COVID. Even before the CDC had modified its definition of the unvaccinated, the hospital system was reclassifying patients who had only received one vaccine as unvaccinated, she said. \u201cThe worst part of it was when the pulmonologists decided that unvaccinated patients would get seven days on the ventilator, then they would tell the families that nothing more could be done,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would then terminally extubate these patients even when more could have been done.\u201d The nurse personally witnessed this, she said, with a 33-year-old mother of two children. \u201cShe had been on ivermectin at home and was viewed as an anti-vax conspiracy theorist,\u201d the nurse said. Before the mother was terminally extubated and her status changed to \u201ccomfort care,\u201d the nurse said she argued with hospital administrators for 12 hours. She had asked the pulmonologist to consider running more tests, she said. \u201cIt had been over a week since the last D-dimer, and this would have indicated whether fibrin in the bloodstream was increasing or decreasing,\u201d the nurse explained. \u201cThe usual process with a known pulmonary embolism was to check every three days. There were more anticoagulant drugs and routes of administration that could have been utilized. Intravenous heparin is reversible. If they were willing to withdraw life support, why were they not willing to try something that could clear a circulatory impairment?\u201d In the end, the hospital won, she said. \u201cThe mother died gasping for air while my hand was on her back,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I went to my manager and asked for an audit to be done on our coagulation times and pulmonary embolism treatment protocols. That got me booted from the ICU until I was fired.\u201d The nurse said she observed administrators repeatedly promoting the safety of the vaccine, though these claims weren\u2019t reflecting what they were seeing with the growing cases of vaccine injuries. Though there was some staff who saw the truth but ignored it to keep their jobs, there were many whom she observed\u2014just as Kay reported\u2014who exhibited \u201cmind-blowing cognitive dissonance.\u201d \u201cThey received the vaccines themselves, and if they were to ever confront the possibility that they willingly became the hands of a truly evil agenda, I don\u2019t think they could live with themselves,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cI used to consider my co-workers as people with whom I\u2019d trust my life, but after they got that second dose of the vaccine, it was like they had a hive mind bent on hatred. It\u2019s very eerie to say that out loud.\u201d",

        "title":"UV Robots Sweeping Hospitals, Killing the Coronavirus Using Light",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/uv-robots\/",
        "text":"Experts have repeatedly told us that the best way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to avoid physical distance with sick people. But that\u2019s pretty difficult to achieve in modern society, where more than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, using public transport, eating in the same restaurants, drinking together in pubs, and interacting in a myriad other ways every single day. Since the COVID-19 virus is so incredibly contagious, public areas frequented by large groups of people, as well as hospital rooms that have been used by sick patients, need to be carefully disinfected. Robots that can disinfect these areas by utilizing the power of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays are the latest weapon in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Why ultraviolet light is the right weapon against COVID-19 The sun is an incredibly powerful natural disinfectant; its ultraviolet rays are strong enough to kill most harmful bacteria on exposed skin or clothing by destroying the nucleic acids in bacteria and other types of microbes. As reported by The Epoch Times, concentrated UVC light has already been used for over five decades as an effective disinfectant in the manufacture of many different beverages, as well as for disinfecting fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, frozen foods and baked goods. Now, robots using this same type of light are being used to safely disinfect hospital rooms that have housed COVID-19 patients, as well as other public areas. As reported by the BBC, though this technology has been available for some time, the coronavirus has \u201crocketed\u201d demand for these special robots. An employee disinfects a Johannesburg, South Africa, hospital with a robot that emits ultraviolet light. (AFP\/Getty Images) According to Sam Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, \u201ctruckloads\u201d of these robots have already been shipped to China, and more recently demand has escalated in other parts of the world. The BBC reported: Production has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark\u2019s third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub. Glowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can\u2019t multiply. \u2026 The job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there\u2019s a smell, much like burned hair. As explained by The Epoch Times, Klaran, another firm that specializes in UVC LED products, has developed a robot that uses wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers (UVC) to effectively disinfect against pathogens. And Dimer UVC Innovation, based in Los Angeles, has developed a robot that can disinfect up to 10 hospital rooms in a single hour. The Epoch Times reported: Dimer just announced that it will offer GermFalcon robots designed to autonomously navigate through airplane cabins and passenger terminal waiting areas to strategically \u2018kill viruses, bacteria, and superbugs\u2019 on high-touch surfaces. Co-founder Elliot Kreitenberg stated the Dimer germ-killing system will participate in the coronavirus emergency response efforts at the Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Prof Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark, explains that many different organisms can cause infections, but that the correct dose of ultraviolet light, applied for an appropriate length of time, will kill most of them. He added, \u201cThis type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\u201d Sources: Theepochtimes.com BBC.com Credit: Naturalnews.com Image: Flickr\/NIAID Follow us Share this article",

        "text":"Ninety miles south of Phoenix is an airport located in the middle of the Arizona desert just off of an isolated strip of I-10. With only one runway and no passenger terminal, Pinal Air Park doesn\u2019t see commercial airline service but it is home to some of the most iconic aircraft ever to roam the skies. Known in the industry as an aircraft boneyard, Pinal Air Park is where aircraft are housed for long-term storage. In other words, it\u2019s a retirement home of sorts for grounded airliners whose time has come as newer, younger planes take their place in airline fleets across the world. At the airfield in Marana, Arizona, the skeletons of old workhorses, including some from airlines that do not exist anymore, can be found baking in the desert sun. While their time in the sky has long passed, their parts continue to prove useful to current sky-bound aircraft. Though most aircraft that enter storage in Marana never take to the skies again, the COVID-19 crisis has given the town a slew of new arrivals that airlines hope will only be temporary visitors rather permanent residents. Take a look at which aircraft some of the world\u2019s airlines are sending to the Arizona desert to ride out the industry downturn caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus. Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona is one the many aircraft boneyards located in the American Southwest, a region known for its hot, dry climates that help preserve aircraft.

        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/china-app\/",
        "text":"As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of citizens The \u201chealth code\u201d service \u2013 run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government \u2013 give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities. The apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine. The apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province. Some restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport. However, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people\u2019s private lives and data. There have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous \u201cred\u201d designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance. \u201cWhy should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?\u201d said one user. \u201cCan\u2019t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people\u2019s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don\u2019t know what leaders are thinking?\u201d The apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person\u2019s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. According to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software. Official guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as \u201cthe history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident\u201d. It draws on medical information including \u201csymptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area\u201d, and the user\u2019s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver. The health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as \u201cAlipay Health code\u201d spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.

From LA Times: Ideally, single-use face masks should be worn once and then thrown away, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s certainly true of the top-of-the-line N95 masks used by healthcare workers that are designed to filter out 95% of tiny particles when properly fitted to a wearer\u2019s face. But last week, the CDC released new guidance on decontamination methods for emergency situations, such as the one healthcare workers are facing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any disinfection process would need to kill the coronavirus without harming an N95 mask\u2019s ability to filter particles or fit snugly to the skin. Ultraviolet germicidal radiation is one of the methods presented by the CDC, and UV light has generated great interest from the public. It\u2019s already used in hospitals to disinfect contaminated surfaces. And there\u2019s a fairly robust market of devices aimed at consumers, such as disinfectants for sleep apnea machines (although no such devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration so far). Other products purport to clean cellphones and disinfect water bottles. Here\u2019s a closer look at what ultraviolet light is and why it could be a useful tool in combating the coronavirus in certain situations. What is UV light? Ultraviolet light, also known as UV light, is invisible to humans. Though it\u2019s adjacent to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, its wavelengths are just too short for our eyes to register and see. UV rays are also high-energy, so while we can\u2019t see them, we certainly feel their effects. For instance, ultraviolet light generated by the sun is what gives you a tan \u2014 or a sunburn. It can also lead to skin cancer. Ultraviolet light falls into three categories, according to the World Health Organization: \u2022 UVA: This is the lowest-energy form of UV, and it accounts for about 95% of the ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth from the sun. It can penetrate deep into the skin\u2019s layers, which makes it responsible for the early tanning effect. It also contributes to skin aging, wrinkling and possibly skin cancer. \u2022 UVB: This higher-energy type of ultraviolet light can permeate the skin\u2019s superficial layers. It\u2019s responsible for delayed tanning (and burning), and is a big contributor to skin cancer and aging. Most of the UVB that comes our way is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s ozone layer, so it only makes up about 5% of the solar UV that reaches Earth. \u2022 UVC: The highest-energy category of ultraviolet light \u2014 any higher and you\u2019d be in X-ray territory \u2014 is also the most damaging. Luckily, the ozone layer and atmosphere completely absorb it. The UV light used in medical disinfection devices is a particular wavelength of UVC. How does UV disinfect stuff? Ultraviolet light can penetrate the cells of pathogens and damage the DNA or RNA that contain their genetic code, said Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire. There\u2019s also some evidence that UV can damage the amino acids and proteins that either protect the virus or allow it to attach to and infect a host cell. So it\u2019s already in use? Yes. People have been disinfecting things with UV for more than a century, according to Ron Hofmann, an environmental engineer at the University of Toronto. Many experts say the first full-scale UV disinfection system for water treatment was used in Marseilles, France, in 1910, Malley said. Modern UV devices come in a range of shapes and sizes. Some are not much bigger than cellphones. Others can be as large as a Cadillac Escalade \u2014 or multiple Escalades parked nose to bumper, in the case of the systems used to disinfect drinking water in Los Angeles and New York, Malley said. Many midsize UV machines \u2014 about the size of a large garbage bin \u2014 are used in hospitals to disinfect patients\u2019 rooms after they\u2019ve left.

        "title":"Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Coronavirus",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/bioweapons-expert-coronavirus\/",
        "text":"As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world. The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3 On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 \u2014 a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5 Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. \u2014 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, \u201cThe World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out \u2018all the stops\u2019\u201d to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China \u201cappeared to be over the worst\u201d of it, CBS said. All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7 COVID-19 \u2014 A Weaponized Coronavirus? In this interview, Francis Boyle \u2014 whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science \u2014 shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus. For decades, he\u2019s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr. At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup. As a result of Boyle\u2019s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration \u2014 a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons \u2014 Boyle has carefully followed \u201cmysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\u201d that have appeared since then. \u201cMy biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted. Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cSo, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me. There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It\u2019s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus. There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons. For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility \u2026 maybe mid-November \u2026 and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\u201d Many Unknowns Remain The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it\u2019s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it\u2019s 30 days, Boyle says. \u201cAs for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they\u2019re basically under martial law. There\u2019s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019re at war here, and that is correct. They\u2019re at war with their own biological warfare agent. President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] forces saying they\u2019re health care workers. They don\u2019t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that\u2019s my best reading of the situation.\u201d When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says: \u201cIt could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with. We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin \u2026 resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg. Winnipeg is Canada\u2019s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It\u2019s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don\u2019t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with. They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven\u2019t seen before. Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected. It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and \u2026 there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record. I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I\u2019ve never had a security clearance. I\u2019ve never had access to any type of secret information. I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary. Right now, I\u2019m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they\u2019ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\u201d Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \u201cWHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses. \u201cI won\u2019t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There\u2019s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cAs for the CDC, it has been involved in every \u2026 BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran \u2026 Of course, the problem is that when that war was over \u2026 an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein\u2019s biological warfare facilities, and that\u2019s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons \u2026 [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that \u2026 murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.\u201d According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry. \u201cClearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons. That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard. I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did \u2026 I want to make it clear I\u2019m not here to speak in their name, I\u2019m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, \u2018Biological Warfare and Terrorism,\u2019 professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I\u2019m saying, if you don\u2019t think I know enough science about it.\u201d US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse. Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola. For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \u201cThe Great Bird Flu Hoax,\u201d then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero. It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created. \u201c[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\u201d Boyle notes. \u201cIt was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\u201d Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very good,\u201d Boyle says. Understanding the COVID-19 Virus According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \u201cThat was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\u201d This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal. Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds: \u201cThey used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct \u2026 We became a police state \u2026 And as I pointed out in \u2018Biowarfare and Terrorism,\u2019 I think the same people who were behind the 9\/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I\u2019m just connecting dots there \u2026 What\u2019s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001. The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs. As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, \u2018Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.\u2019 I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me. At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that\u2019s been the case since the first week of November 2001.\u201d As noted by Boyle, George Orwell\u2019s book, \u201c1984,\u201d has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act. \u201cSnowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cAnd again, the proof is I\u2019ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\u201d Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax \u2014 a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What\u2019s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says: \u201cThere was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall \u2026 on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that\u2019s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 \u2026 John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there \u2026 that they proudly announce on their website \u2026 They justify it by saying they\u2019re developing vaccines. OK \u2026 How do they do that? They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology \u2026 set up by the Pentagon under DARPA \u2026 Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people. So, they\u2019re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well. John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That\u2019s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\u201d Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13 How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection? While it\u2019s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik\u2019s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection. Marik\u2019s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer. According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18 It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall \u201415 days compared to 22.19 While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis. You can learn more about Marik\u2019s sepsis protocol in \u201cVitamin C \u2014 A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,\u201d along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place. You can also review Marik\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, \u201cHydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,\u201d presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

        "title":"Privacy Concerns Over China\u2019s AI-Run Phone Apps That Track User Activity and Make Mandatory Coronavirus Quarantine Decisions",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/china-app\/",
        "text":"As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of citizens The \u201chealth code\u201d service \u2013 run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government \u2013 give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities. The apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine. The apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province. Some restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport. However, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people\u2019s private lives and data. There have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous \u201cred\u201d designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance. \u201cWhy should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?\u201d said one user. \u201cCan\u2019t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people\u2019s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don\u2019t know what leaders are thinking?\u201d The apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person\u2019s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. According to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software. Official guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as \u201cthe history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident\u201d. It draws on medical information including \u201csymptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area\u201d, and the user\u2019s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver. The health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as \u201cAlipay Health code\u201d spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.

        "text":"A man in Florida has been arrested with the charge of murder just one day after he was freed from jail to \u2018help prevent the spread of coronavirus.\u2019 Joseph Williams, 26, was initially booked into Orient Road Jail on March 13 for possession of heroin (less than four grams), a third-degree felony, and possession drug paraphernalia, a first-degree misdemeanor. But on March 19 Williams was one of 164 inmates deemed low-risk who was allowed to leave custody following the issuance of Administrative Order 2020-018 which allows people to go free early to decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 in crowded facilities. He left the Hillsborough County jail at 8.02am but by 10.40pm the next day, police were called to the scene of 8000 block of Ash Avenue in Tampa where a man had been shot dead. Williams is believed to be responsible for the second-degree murder. \u2018There is no question Joseph Williams took advantage of this health emergency to commit crimes while he was out of jail awaiting resolution of a low-level, non-violent offense,\u2019 Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. \u2018As a result, I call on the State Attorney to prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law.\u2019 Just days after Williams entered jail, Chronister had said at a media briefing they were releasing more than 100 inmates for the safety of fellow jailers and staff. Early release is a move that jails around the country have opted for to slow the spread of the virus. More from Daily Mail Follow us Share this article",

The country faked numbers on purpose, the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report given to the White House last week, Bloomberg News reported, citing three U.S. officials. \u201cChina\u2019s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cTwo of the officials said the report concludes that China\u2019s numbers are fake.\u201d As of Wednesday, China \u2014 the epicenter of the global pandemic \u2014 has claimed to have under 83,000 cases and around 3,300 deaths.

        "title":"New Common Symptom of Coronavirus Observed by US Hospitals Revealed",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/new-common-symptom-coronavirus\/",
        "text":"United States hospitals have observed some new symptoms that are not included in the list made available by the CDC. Scientists continue to learn more about the virus as it spreads. There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths. According to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3\/28\/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light. Although the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it. Experts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations. From International Business Times: A New Symptom The throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms. Michael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains. Stomach Pain And Pneumonia According to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients\u2019 lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area. Dr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough. No Respiratory Symptoms The general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain. On the other hand, it is the older patients who show respiratory symptoms. According to health experts, common symptoms of COVID-19 are having a high temperature, shortness of breathing, and a new, continuous cough. Some patients reported having diarrhea and suffering from conjunctivitis (pink eye), which health experts later on attributed to coronavirus infection.

        "title":"Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Coronavirus",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/bioweapons-expert-coronavirus\/",
        "text":"As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world. The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3 On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 \u2014 a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5 Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. \u2014 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, \u201cThe World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out \u2018all the stops\u2019\u201d to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China \u201cappeared to be over the worst\u201d of it, CBS said. All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7 COVID-19 \u2014 A Weaponized Coronavirus? In this interview, Francis Boyle \u2014 whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science \u2014 shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus. For decades, he\u2019s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr. At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup. As a result of Boyle\u2019s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration \u2014 a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons \u2014 Boyle has carefully followed \u201cmysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\u201d that have appeared since then. \u201cMy biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted. Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cSo, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me. There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It\u2019s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus. There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons. For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility \u2026 maybe mid-November \u2026 and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\u201d Many Unknowns Remain The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it\u2019s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it\u2019s 30 days, Boyle says. \u201cAs for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they\u2019re basically under martial law. There\u2019s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019re at war here, and that is correct. They\u2019re at war with their own biological warfare agent. President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] forces saying they\u2019re health care workers. They don\u2019t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that\u2019s my best reading of the situation.\u201d When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says: \u201cIt could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with. We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin \u2026 resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg. Winnipeg is Canada\u2019s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It\u2019s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don\u2019t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with. They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven\u2019t seen before. Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected. It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and \u2026 there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record. I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I\u2019ve never had a security clearance. I\u2019ve never had access to any type of secret information. I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary. Right now, I\u2019m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they\u2019ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\u201d Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \u201cWHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses. \u201cI won\u2019t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There\u2019s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cAs for the CDC, it has been involved in every \u2026 BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran \u2026 Of course, the problem is that when that war was over \u2026 an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein\u2019s biological warfare facilities, and that\u2019s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons \u2026 [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that \u2026 murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.\u201d According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry. \u201cClearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons. That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard. I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did \u2026 I want to make it clear I\u2019m not here to speak in their name, I\u2019m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, \u2018Biological Warfare and Terrorism,\u2019 professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I\u2019m saying, if you don\u2019t think I know enough science about it.\u201d US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse. Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola. For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \u201cThe Great Bird Flu Hoax,\u201d then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero. It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created. \u201c[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\u201d Boyle notes. \u201cIt was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\u201d Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very good,\u201d Boyle says. Understanding the COVID-19 Virus According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \u201cThat was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\u201d This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal. Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds: \u201cThey used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct \u2026 We became a police state \u2026 And as I pointed out in \u2018Biowarfare and Terrorism,\u2019 I think the same people who were behind the 9\/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I\u2019m just connecting dots there \u2026 What\u2019s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001. The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs. As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, \u2018Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.\u2019 I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me. At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that\u2019s been the case since the first week of November 2001.\u201d As noted by Boyle, George Orwell\u2019s book, \u201c1984,\u201d has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act. \u201cSnowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cAnd again, the proof is I\u2019ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\u201d Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax \u2014 a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What\u2019s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says: \u201cThere was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall \u2026 on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that\u2019s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 \u2026 John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there \u2026 that they proudly announce on their website \u2026 They justify it by saying they\u2019re developing vaccines. OK \u2026 How do they do that? They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology \u2026 set up by the Pentagon under DARPA \u2026 Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people. So, they\u2019re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well. John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That\u2019s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\u201d Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13 How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection? While it\u2019s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik\u2019s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection. Marik\u2019s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer. According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18 It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall \u201415 days compared to 22.19 While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis. You can learn more about Marik\u2019s sepsis protocol in \u201cVitamin C \u2014 A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,\u201d along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.

The country faked numbers on purpose, the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report given to the White House last week, Bloomberg News reported, citing three U.S. officials. \u201cChina\u2019s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cTwo of the officials said the report concludes that China\u2019s numbers are fake.\u201d As of Wednesday, China \u2014 the epicenter of the global pandemic \u2014 has claimed to have under 83,000 cases and around 3,300 deaths. That\u2019s significantly less than the U.S., which as reported more than 200,000, or Italy with 110,000, or Spain with 102,000. In recent weeks, Wuhan has reported no new cases almost every day, a drop from the thousands it reported every day until mid-February, and the hundreds into early March. Deborah Birx, the State Department immunologist on the Coronavirus Task Force, said on Tuesday that China\u2019s data was interpreted by the medical community as: \u201cThis was serious, but smaller than anyone expected.\u201d \u201cBecause I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data, now that we see what happened to Italy and see what happened to Spain.\u201d More from the-sun.com Follow us Share this article",

        "title":"New Common Symptom of Coronavirus Observed by US Hospitals Revealed",
        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/new-common-symptom-coronavirus\/",
        "text":"United States hospitals have observed some new symptoms that are not included in the list made available by the CDC. Scientists continue to learn more about the virus as it spreads. There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths. According to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3\/28\/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light. Although the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it. Experts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations. From International Business Times: A New Symptom The throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms. Michael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains. Stomach Pain And Pneumonia According to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients\u2019 lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area. Dr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough. No Respiratory Symptoms The general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain. On the other hand, it is the older patients who show respiratory symptoms. According to health experts, common symptoms of COVID-19 are having a high temperature, shortness of breathing, and a new, continuous cough. Some patients reported having diarrhea and suffering from conjunctivitis (pink eye), which health experts later on attributed to coronavirus infection.

        "text":"A man in Florida has been arrested with the charge of murder just one day after he was freed from jail to \u2018help prevent the spread of coronavirus.\u2019 Joseph Williams, 26, was initially booked into Orient Road Jail on March 13 for possession of heroin (less than four grams), a third-degree felony, and possession drug paraphernalia, a first-degree misdemeanor. But on March 19 Williams was one of 164 inmates deemed low-risk who was allowed to leave custody following the issuance of Administrative Order 2020-018 which allows people to go free early to decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 in crowded facilities. He left the Hillsborough County jail at 8.02am but by 10.40pm the next day, police were called to the scene of 8000 block of Ash Avenue in Tampa where a man had been shot dead. Williams is believed to be responsible for the second-degree murder. \u2018There is no question Joseph Williams took advantage of this health emergency to commit crimes while he was out of jail awaiting resolution of a low-level, non-violent offense,\u2019 Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. \u2018As a result, I call on the State Attorney to prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law.\u2019 Just days after Williams entered jail, Chronister had said at a media briefing they were releasing more than 100 inmates for the safety of fellow jailers and staff.

        "link":"https:\/\/realfarmacy.com\/uv-robots\/",
        "text":"Experts have repeatedly told us that the best way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to avoid physical distance with sick people. But that\u2019s pretty difficult to achieve in modern society, where more than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, using public transport, eating in the same restaurants, drinking together in pubs, and interacting in a myriad other ways every single day. Since the COVID-19 virus is so incredibly contagious, public areas frequented by large groups of people, as well as hospital rooms that have been used by sick patients, need to be carefully disinfected. Robots that can disinfect these areas by utilizing the power of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays are the latest weapon in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Why ultraviolet light is the right weapon against COVID-19 The sun is an incredibly powerful natural disinfectant; its ultraviolet rays are strong enough to kill most harmful bacteria on exposed skin or clothing by destroying the nucleic acids in bacteria and other types of microbes. As reported by The Epoch Times, concentrated UVC light has already been used for over five decades as an effective disinfectant in the manufacture of many different beverages, as well as for disinfecting fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, frozen foods and baked goods. Now, robots using this same type of light are being used to safely disinfect hospital rooms that have housed COVID-19 patients, as well as other public areas. As reported by the BBC, though this technology has been available for some time, the coronavirus has \u201crocketed\u201d demand for these special robots. An employee disinfects a Johannesburg, South Africa, hospital with a robot that emits ultraviolet light. (AFP\/Getty Images) According to Sam Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, \u201ctruckloads\u201d of these robots have already been shipped to China, and more recently demand has escalated in other parts of the world. The BBC reported: Production has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark\u2019s third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub. Glowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can\u2019t multiply. \u2026 The job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there\u2019s a smell, much like burned hair. As explained by The Epoch Times, Klaran, another firm that specializes in UVC LED products, has developed a robot that uses wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers (UVC) to effectively disinfect against pathogens. And Dimer UVC Innovation, based in Los Angeles, has developed a robot that can disinfect up to 10 hospital rooms in a single hour. The Epoch Times reported: Dimer just announced that it will offer GermFalcon robots designed to autonomously navigate through airplane cabins and passenger terminal waiting areas to strategically \u2018kill viruses, bacteria, and superbugs\u2019 on high-touch surfaces. Co-founder Elliot Kreitenberg stated the Dimer germ-killing system will participate in the coronavirus emergency response efforts at the Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Prof Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark, explains that many different organisms can cause infections, but that the correct dose of ultraviolet light, applied for an appropriate length of time, will kill most of them. He added, \u201cThis type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\u201d Sources: Theepochtimes.com BBC.com Credit: Naturalnews.com Image: Flickr\/NIAID Follow us Share this article",

Police said in a statement: \u201cWe take these complaints very seriously and would like to thank all of those who reported the video so the issue could be addressed.\u201d Cody Pfister, 26, has been charged with making a terrorist threat after the video caused global outrage. Piers Morgan, one of the hosts of Good Morning Britain, aired the clip on Monday as he blasted the gross behavior. He showed the video in the hope people in the UK don\u2019t get the same idea. Piers led calls for his arrest and said he should be denied healthcare if he comes down with the killer bug. He furiously said: \u201cThis is of somebody in America, who went to a supermarket knowing the coronavirus is attacking everyone in the United States and he did this and posted it online. \u201cWhat I would like to happen to him is I\u2019d like him found, and I am sure they will get him. \u201cI would like him put in prison, immediately. And then I would like him deprived of any healthcare should he then get the virus having tried to deliberately give it to potentially lots of other people. \u201cThat might concentrate the minds of these morons and it might concentrate the minds of these morons we have here.\u201d It was originally thought the video was filmed in Missouri, which is were Pfister is from. Piers also tweeted: \u201cFind him, arrest him, imprison him, and deny him any healthcare if he gets the virus. More from thesun.com Follow us Share this article",

        "text":"Ninety miles south of Phoenix is an airport located in the middle of the Arizona desert just off of an isolated strip of I-10. With only one runway and no passenger terminal, Pinal Air Park doesn\u2019t see commercial airline service but it is home to some of the most iconic aircraft ever to roam the skies. Known in the industry as an aircraft boneyard, Pinal Air Park is where aircraft are housed for long-term storage. In other words, it\u2019s a retirement home of sorts for grounded airliners whose time has come as newer, younger planes take their place in airline fleets across the world. At the airfield in Marana, Arizona, the skeletons of old workhorses, including some from airlines that do not exist anymore, can be found baking in the desert sun. While their time in the sky has long passed, their parts continue to prove useful to current sky-bound aircraft. Though most aircraft that enter storage in Marana never take to the skies again, the COVID-19 crisis has given the town a slew of new arrivals that airlines hope will only be temporary visitors rather permanent residents. Take a look at which aircraft some of the world\u2019s airlines are sending to the Arizona desert to ride out the industry downturn caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus. Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona is one the many aircraft boneyards located in the American Southwest, a region known for its hot, dry climates that help preserve aircraft.

        "text":"The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a change of heart from its Apr. 7, 2022 decision, agreed to hear arguments against the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for federal workers. The court will hear the matter en banc which means that there will be a full panel of judges convened. This decision vacates the court\u2019s previous ruling which reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers. Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers has once again been paused.1 2 3 Implementation of the COVID vaccine mandate will be delayed until at least September when the full court will hear arguments. The Biden administration has announced that they will not process or make any decisions regarding medical or religious exemptions to the mandate or suspend or fire any workers for failing to comply with President Biden\u2019s mandate pending the court\u2019s decision.4 The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previous decision reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers based on the court\u2019s conclusion that the president of the United States has the power to order to federal employees to get vaccinated, while federal judges do not have jurisdiction to interfere. Because the court found that they did not have authority to override the president in matters like this, the judges did not rule on the merits of the case. In September, the same court en banc may be more likely to consider all arguments and make a decision on the merits of the case.5 History of the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for Federal Workers In September 2021, the Biden administration ordered that all federal workers receive a COVID vaccination as a condition of employment. In January 2022, however, a Federal District Court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against the mandate, which halted the vaccine requirement for federal workers. The court blocked the mandate, finding that it exceeded the President\u2019s authority and required Congressional approval.6 The judges ruled: \u2026 no legal remedy adequately protects the liberty interests of employees who must choose between violating a mandate of doubtful validity or consenting to an unwanted medical procedure that cannot be undone.7 The Biden administration appealed the decision. In February, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas District Court\u2019s temporary injunction pending the outcome of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals final ruling.8 On Apr. 7, however, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Biden administration and held that the federal vaccine mandate must be reinstated, and the case dismissed. The court held that a federal judge does not have jurisdiction over federal employees challenging the vaccine mandate and redress is found exclusively under Civil Service Law.9 The court said that the President, as CEO of the executive branch, has proper authority to issue a mandate on federal employees.10 Advocacy Group Feds for Medical Freedom Presses On The ruling reinstating the mandate effective May 23, faced a challenge when an advocacy group called Feds for Medical Freedom and other interested parties filed a petition seeking to overturn the decision and requested that the full 17-member court hear new arguments in the matter.11 Feds for Medical Freedom, which has over 6,000 members, argues that the President\u2019s unilateral decision to affect the lives of millions of federal employees is, \u201ca matter of exceptional importance,\u201d which necessitates a hearing en banc. The group also contends that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s April opinion contradicts previous court precedent with regard to pre-enforcement challenges.12 Marcus Thronton, president of Feds for Medical Freedom, pointed out the high stakes of this case stating: A policy that threatens to derail or end the careers of dedicated public servants who do not consent to take a COVID vaccine is both unconstitutional and immoral.13 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/08\/herpes-zoster-reactivated-following-mrna-covid-shots-studies-show\/",
        "text":"Concerns about the adverse effects of mRNA COVID-19 shots continue to grow a year and a half after they began to be distributed under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted to Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Cases of herpes zoster (HZ) following messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID shots have been reported in the U.S. and worldwide.1 2 What is Herpes Zoster? Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a viral infection that results in an outbreak of a painful rash or blisters on the skin. The same virus that causes chickenpox (varicella zoster), is known to cause herpes zoster in adults. The virus clinically manifests as rashes or blisters in one area of the body.3 When children contract and recover from a chickenpox infection, the virus remains dormant in the human body and has the potential to reactivate again as herpes zoster in adulthood.4 Recent studies and case studies have shown the reactivation of herpes zoster virus following administration of mRNA) COVID shots, which includes Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s BNT162b2 (also known as \u201cComirnaty\u201d) and Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 (or \u201cSpikevax\u201d) biologics.5 Herpes Zoster Develops After mRNA Shots in Older and Immune Compromised Patients A 2022 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology is the first epidemiological evidence that suggests an increased risk of HZ after getting mRNA COVID shots.6 The study shows that HZ may occur shortly after mRNA COVID shots at higher frequency than is reported following influenza vaccinations. The study also shows that the risk of HZ reporting was more common among older age groups than those who are under 40 years old. HZ infections may occur in patients previously infected with varicella zoster virus, especially in patients who are immune compromised and mainly presents as shingles, cranial nerve palsy, meningitis, myelitis, retinitis or hepatitis. The researchers observed that currently HZ reactions following mRNA COVID shots are mild and infrequent.7 In another systemic review published in 2021 in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, a total of 54 HZ cases were investigated, which included 27 male and 27 female patients that were cases with known risk factors for herpes zoster, which included age 50 or above and having chronic disease, such as a malignancy or an immunological, metabolic or psychiatric disorder.8 The average period between development of herpes zoster and administration of COVID shots was approximately seven days. Eighty percent (36\/45 cases) of the sample cases developed herpes zoster following the first COVID shot among those who received the mRNA biologic.9 Case Studies of Herpes Zoster in Young, Healthy Adults After COVID Shot A case series published in 2022 in the Journal of Cutaneous Medicine describes four cases of herpes zoster in young healthy adults with no known risk factors for varicella zoster virus reactivation.10 The first case was a healthy 27-year-old female with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), who received her second dose of Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s BNT162b2 biologic in her left arm. Thirty days later, a group of itchy, painful lesions erupted on the right shoulder. She had a history of past varicella zoster infection as a child but no history of previous HZ.11 The second case was a healthy 20-year-old male with a past medical history of asthma, who presented with HZ six days after receiving his second injection of BNT162b2 in his left arm. The lesion appeared in the on the left abdomen. The patient had received the chickenpox vaccine as a child.12 The third case was a healthy 32-year-old female with a history of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) who presented with HZ 28 days after receiving the second dose of Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 biologic in her left arm. The lesion was located over the right breast area. Patient had a history of childhood infection of chickenpox but no history of HZ.13 The fourth case is a healthy 27-year-old female with no past medical history, who presented symptoms of HZ 39 days after receiving a second dose of mRNA-1273 in her right arm. The lesion was located on her left arm and there was a history of chickenpox infection in childhood but no history of prior HZ.14 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Officials in some cities in China have ordered all indoor pets belonging to SARS-CoV-2 patients to be killed due to fear that the animals could transmit the virus to other humans.1 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly originated in a wet food market or biohazard lab in Wuhan, China in late 2019, government officials in China have been implementing a zero-transmission policy in an attempt to eradicate the virus. Chinese public health officials believe the zero-COVID policy will stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but,2 despite taking more and more extreme measures to prevent transmission of the virus.3 4 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials have stated that the risk of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2 to human beings is low but that the virus can spread from people to animals during close contact.5 Public Health Officials Tell Anci District to Kill Pets of SARS-CoV-2 Patients On the morning of Mar. 30, 2022, Anci District Prevention and Control Office issued a notice stating: In order to ensure the safety of positive patients returning home, after communicating with the Langfang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is necessary to comprehensively and thoroughly kill the animals domesticated by positive patients as soon as possible.6 The Office of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Anci District, which is responsible for designating professional culling teams, confirmed that it had received the notice from public health officials at the Anci District Prevention and Control Office.7 By 5:00 pm on Mar. 30, 2022, reportedly the \u201corder\u201d had been halted due to public outrage. It is not known how many pets had been killed before the order was suspended.8 Pets Reportedly Killed While Owners Were in Quarantine A Chinese woman who identified herself as Ms. Fu said that she was asked to quarantine in the city of Shangrao after government contact tracers said she had been in close contact with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She tested negative for the virus.9 She was not able to quarantine with her dog. However, community workers assured her the corgi would be taken care of in her home while she was away. Home security camera showed community workers taking Ms. Fu\u2019s dog away, after which he was killed. The video went viral on China\u2019s social media platform known as Weibo, causing public outrage.10 Another woman from the city of Harbin said that her three cats were killed in September 2021 while she was in quarantine. It has been also reported that authorities in cities of Chengdu and Wuxi have entered homes of people that are in quarantine and killed their pets.11 During the course of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in China have killed pets on several occasions, resulting in conflicts between local governments and citizens.12 Metal Barriers Go Up in Shanghai Apartment Complexes Associated Press reported on Apr. 24 that Chinese officials were erecting metal barrier fences in neighborhoods around buildings and apartment complexes in Shanghai, where they believe people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apparently, public health officials have identified more than 21,000 new COVID-19 cases with most of the cases being asymptomatic and driven by the omicron variant circulating in Shanghai.13 According to the AP story, many residents in the city have had trouble getting groceries and access to medical care because of the barriers and strict controls on movement. A video circulated on the internet earlier in April heard Chinese people subjected to draconian lockdown measures screaming from their apartments \u201cSend us food!

        "text":"NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore), which operates six hospitals in the Chicago area, agreed to pay approximately $10.3 million to employees who were discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate in an historic class action settlement against a private employer.1 2 3 Liberty Counsel filed a class action lawsuit against the healthcare provider in federal court, together with a motion for a temporary restraining order and injunction after Northshore refused to comply with an October 2021 demand letter requesting religious exemptions for about 523 employees. Approximately 204 of the employees agreed to take the COVID vaccine despite their religious beliefs and 269 resigned or were fired for their refusal to violate their religious beliefs and take the shot.4 5 The employees alleged that almost all COVID vaccine religious exemption requests were initially denied and, when a few religious exemptions were eventually granted, only remote work was offered as an accommodation, which is not suited for many healthcare positions. NorthShore ignored the employees offers to be regularly tested, wear masks and report if they had symptoms instead of getting the vaccine.6 7 Class Action Settlement Agreement Signed The class action settlement agreement signed by both parties stipulates that employees who were fired or forced to resign when they refused to take the novel vaccine will receive approximately $25,000 each, while employees who took the shot in order to keep their jobs despite their religious beliefs, will get about $3,000 each. The 13 lead plaintiffs expect to get an additional $20,000.8 Employees who lost their jobs for failing to take the controversial vaccine may apply to be rehired with their religious exemption request granted and all previous benefits and seniority intact, as long as they reapply within 90 days.9 While NorthShore has not admitted to any wrongdoing, the hospital agreed to end their policy of denying all religious exemptions and will no longer discriminate or retaliate against employees who request religious exemptions or accommodations to vaccination. Rather, NorthShore will evaluate religious exemption requests and if approved, offer accommodations in compliance with federal law.10 11 Liberty Counsel Vice President Horatio G. Mihet said: We are very pleased with the historic, $10 million settlement achieved in our class action lawsuit against NorthShore University HealthSystem. The drastic policy change and substantial monetary relief required by the settlement will bring a strong measure of justice to NorthShore\u2019s employees, who were callously forced to choose between their conscience and their jobs. This settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates.12 Title VII Protections Do Not Pause for COVID-19 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, protects employees from religious discrimination in the workplace. Employees who inform their employer that their sincerely held religious beliefs prevent them from complying with a mandatory work requirement are protected from discrimination and retaliation in the workplace under Title VII. Employers have an affirmative obligation to seriously consider the request, enter into good faith talks and offer appropriate accommodations.13 Liberty Counsel alleges that NorthShore\u2019s actions violated Title VII when they did not consider each religious exemption individually and provide reasonable accommodations to workers with sincerely held religious beliefs.14 15 In response to the settlement, labor and employment attorney Margo Wolf O\u2019Donnell said: \u201cIf there is a vaccine mandate, it\u2019s important that requests for exemptions, whether they be religious or medical exemption requests, they be considered on a case-by-case basis. Employers still can have vaccine mandates. I just think they need to be implemented appropriately.16 The plaintiffs also alleged that NorthShore\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine policy was contrary to the Illinois Health Care Rights of Conscience Act17 and federal law regarding vaccines approved for Emergency Use because employees were not allowed to decline the vaccine. Federal law provides: [A]s a condition of receiving authorization for Emergency Use, all individuals to whom the product may be administered are given the right to accept or refuse administration of the product.18 NorthShore said of the settlement, \u201cWe continue to support systemwide, evidence-based vaccination requirements for everyone who works at NorthShore\u2014Edward-Elmhurst Health and thank our team members for helping to keep our communities safe.19 Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel Matt Staver warned: This settlement should be a wake-up call to every employer that did not accommodate or exempt employees who opposed the COVID shots for religious reasons. Let this case be a warning to employers that violated Title VII. It is especially significant and gratifying that this first classwide COVID settlement protects health care workers. Health care workers are heroes who daily give their lives to protect and treat their patients. They are needed now more than ever.20 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"The National Guard is a unique branch of the U.S. military that holds both state and national responsibilities ranging from responding to domestic natural disasters to supporting overseas operations. But tens of thousands of National Guard troops are at risk of being discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, worrying lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the Guard will be left crippled. Approximately 40,000 National Guard and 22,000 Reserve troops did not receive their COVID vaccines by the June 30 deadline that was set in place by the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Those who failed to comply were cut off from some benefits and barred from participation in certain military duties. As of July 27, the total number of unvaccinated members of the Guard and Reserve hovers at 39,600.1 Due to both the state and international duties of the Guard, federal officials and governors have argued over who has the final legal say on the vaccine mandates. This has allowed for Guard and Reserve troops to have an extended deadline of seven months longer than other service members. Military Facing Lowest Recruiting Numbers Since Vietnam War Every branch of the military is already facing recruiting difficulties. Military recruitment numbers are the lowest they have been since the Vietnam War. The Army is expecting to reach only 40 percent of its recruitment target for the fiscal year\u2014missing its recruiting goal by 40,000 individuals.2 \u201cWe\u2019re talking about states potentially losing up to 20 percent to 30 percent of their guardsmen and women, replacing them in a very difficult recruiting environment, much less getting them trained to the capability they once were\u201d said Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida. \u201cWhen the next crisis comes to our shores the U.S. will lack the number [of] Guardsmen and women to come to our rescue.\u201d1 Over 1,000 members of the Marine Corps have been discharged for refusal to comply with the vaccine mandate; 469 discharged from the Navy, 287 from the Air Force, and 345 from the Army.3 Pentagon Refuses to Budge on COVID Vaccine Mandates Despite lawmakers, governors, and others pushing back against the mandates, Austin has refused to budge, citing national security. Defense Secretary Austin argues that service members who get COVID disease are not able to work, which jeopardizes the ability to meet combat mission requirements. Secretary Austin wrote to governors that vaccination is key to maintain a healthy military force and to protecting the American people.4 Katherine Kuzminski, director of the Military, Veterans, and Society program, stated: The whole foundation of military action and conflict is based upon the ability to follow through with a lawful order\u2026they don\u2019t necessarily want to retain people who have indicated that they won\u2019t follow a lawful order when it comes to vaccination.1 Several Republican governors are fighting the vaccine mandate for their National Guard troops, with governors from Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas filing lawsuits over the mandate.3 Rep. Waltz, a 26-year veteran, said: I fully understand\u2026 good order and discipline and \u2018an order is an order\u2019. You order the platoon to charge the machine gun on the top of the hill, they\u2019ve got to follow it. But I also think it\u2019s incumbent on us as leaders to constantly evaluate the cost and the risk of our orders. Maybe charging that hill is going to be too costly to that unit.1 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Opinion | It is interesting to observe the mainstream media\u2019s reporting of the recent news that Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For example, the headline of an article by CNBC reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Abbott, who banned mask and vaccine mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d Another headline by Yahoo! News reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who opposes vaccine and mask mandates, tests positive for COVID-19.\u201d Another one by The Guardian reads, \u201cTexas governor Greg Abbott, who fought mask mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d1 2 3 A CNN headline reads, \u201cGov. Abbott tests positive for Covid-19 after months of blocking mask mandates.\u201d One more\u2014this one by BuzzFeed News: \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Tested Positive For COVID-19, As He Fights Mask Mandates.\u201d4 5 There appears to be an orchestrated effort by the mainstream media of trying to convey a subtle message of poetic justice that goes something like this: \u201cThat\u2019ll teach Abbott for being such an obstructionist on mask mandates in his state. Serves him right.\u201d It is a message that is consistent with a disturbing and growing tendency by some Americans to shame and vilify fellow Americans who do not share their enthusiasm for every government COVID-related mandate that comes along. Media Tries to Tie Abbott\u2019s Coronavirus Infection to His Stance on Mask Mandates All of these articles are supposed to be news articles, but from the start they already betray a clear political bias. Gov. Abbott and Gov. Rick DeSantis of Florida have been taking a lot of heat lately from government officials and the media for prohibiting cities and school boards in their states from passing mask mandates for children attending schools. Both Abbott and DeSantis believe that parents should decide whether or not their children wear masks in schools.6 7 8 In a statement on July 29, 2021 about the Executive Order he signed on May 18 prohibiting government entities in Texas from mandating masks,9 Gov. Abbott said: [Parents] have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses, and engage in leisure activities. Vaccines, which remain in abundant supply, are the most effective defense against the virus, and they will always remain voluntary\u2014never forced\u2014in the State of Texas7 In other words, Gov. Abbott\u2019s order doesn\u2019t prohibit children from wearing masks in schools, it simply prohibits Texas state authorities from forcing them to do so. On Aug. 15, the Texas Supreme Court upheld Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition by granting a request for a \u201ctemporary, emergency stay\u201d of an appellate court ruling that would have allowed schools in Dallas and Bexar counties to require masks. In another case involving Travis county, the Texas Supreme Court on Aug. 19 denied Gov. Abbott\u2019s request to \u201cblock temporary restraining orders\u201d on his mask mandate prohibition. That decision effectively allows schools that require students to wear masks, in defiance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition, to proceed.10 On Aug. 3, President Joe Biden called out Gov. Abbott, Gov. DeSantis and other governors for \u201cpassing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.\u201d Biden noted, \u201cAs of now, seven states not only banned mask mandates, but also banned them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated.\u201d7 He added: Look, we need leadership from everyone. If some governors are not willing to do the right thing, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing, to be able to do it. I say to these governors, please help. If you\u2019re not going to help, at least get out of the way of the people trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.6 7 11 More recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona admonished Gov. Abbott and Gov. DeSantis for their executive orders on mask mandates. In a letter to Gov. Abbott, Secretary Cardona wrote that his order \u201cmay infringe upon a school district\u2019s authority to adopt policies to protect students and educators as they develop their safe return to in-person instruction plans required by federal law.\u201d12 Cardona added: The Department [of Education] stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction.12 Abbott Received Three COVID Shots and Still Got Coronavirus The bias that is evident in some of the media coverage about Gov. Abbott\u2019s positive test for coronavirus seems aimed at pressuring Abbott to see the error of his ways by seeking to remind him how contagious is the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for requiring people to abide by the federal government\u2019s masking recommendations. But perhaps the media bias is also meant to distract from a more noteworthy detail of this story, which is that Gov. Abbott is fully vaccinated. Gov. Abbott received the first dose of Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) biologic (known as BNT162b2 or Comirnaty vaccine) on Dec. 22, 2020 and likely received the second dose in January 2021. He reportedly received a third shot\u2014a booster dose\u2014as well. \u201cGovernor Abbott is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, in good health, and currently experiencing no symptoms,\u201d said Mark Miner, the governor\u2019s communications director.13 14 15 16 17 So even with three Comirnaty shots in less than one year, Gov. Abbott still tested positive for coronavirus? That would seem to be the most relevant and concerning point on which to focus. Not his stand on mask mandates. Gov. Abbott can now be added to the growing club of so-called \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d of Americans who contracted coronavirus despite being fully vaccinated. The latest rough estimate of the number breakthrough cases in the United States is 193,204, as reported recently by The Wall Street Journal.18 That figure, however, is based on data provided by only by 44 state health departments and a lack of understanding of how many vaccinated Americans have been asymptomatically infected, so you can bet that the estimate is woefully low.18 19 20 21 It is worth noting that there are some media sources that have at least made an effort to highlight the relevance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s vaccination status. NBC affiliate WAVY-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia reported, \u201cGov. Greg Abbott tests positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated.\u201d Similar examples, though, are rare If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"America First Legal (AFL), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that works to defend American citizens from unconstitutional government overreach, released documents from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealing evidence of collusion between the CDC and major social media corporations to censor free speech on the COVID-19 pandemic and promote a COVID narrative set forth by federal government agencies.1 2 White House Admitted To Working With Facebook to Limit \u201cMisinformation\u201d in 2021 In 2021, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration was working in collaboration with Facebook to limit misinformation on COVID vaccines.3 Psaki stated: So we\u2019re regularly making sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives, dangerous to public health that we and many other Americans are seeing across all of social and traditional media. And we work to engage with them to better understand the enforcement of social media platform policies.4 Psaki also said that if a user is banned for spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d on one social media platform, they should be banned from all other social media platforms as well.5 She noted that the federal government does not directly get involved in controlling information on social media sites but that social media companies make those decisions. Psaki said: We don\u2019t take anything down. We don\u2019t block anything, Facebook, and any private sector company makes decisions about what information should be on their platform. Our point is that there is information that is leading to people not taking the vaccine.6 America First Legal Sues CDC to Release Records on Censorship Following Psaki\u2019s press conference in 2021, AFL submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for documents, records and communications relating to the Biden administration decision to direct social media companies to censor speech pertaining to the COVID pandemic on their platforms.7 Stephen Miller, President of AFL stated: Jen Psaki has unwittingly confirmed a shocking truth: the White House is using massive Big Tech companies as a censorship arm of the federal government. If true, this means that Big Tech censorship is state censorship and thus facially unconstitutional. There is no dividing line between government and big tech\u2014it is an incestuous union, and you cannot tell where one ends and one begins\u2026 AFL is filing these urgent FOIA requests so the full scope of this earth-shaking scandal will be revealed\u2014and so that, in turn, this unconstitutional behavior can be ended.8 The FOIA requests were delayed, after which AFL took further action and filed a lawsuit against the CDC on Apr. 8, 2022 to the release all information in order to assess CDC\u2019s collaboration with social media companies in determining what it deemed as COVID \u201cmisinformation\u201d.9 Gene Hamilton, Vice President and General Counsel of AFL said: What is surprising is that it took litigation to pry these records loose from the federal government, and that the Administration apparently has no qualms about violating the First Amendment in pursuit of its ideological goals. The federal government is not the arbiter of truth for the American people.10 High Level Coordination Between CDC and Social Media Corps to Censor COVID Information After filing the lawsuit, AFL was able to obtain 286 pages of documents revealing communications between federal agencies and social media companies on how to censor information on COVID on their platforms. The documents can be found here.11 The documents reveal that CDC worked very closely with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google to control information about COVID. An e-mail between CDC and Todd O\u2019Boyle, Senior Manager of Public Policy at Twitter and other Twitter officials showed a chart of tweets deemed to be \u201cmisinformation\u201d. The same email mentions regular BOLO (Be On the Look Out) meetings where CDC would share what they categorized as \u201cmisinformation\u201d with various social media companies.12 In another e-mail, CDC stated to Twitter officials that any contextual information should be added to posts about Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) such as \u201cVAERS accepts reports from anyone, including patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.\u201d13 Facebook Offered DHHS Millions in Free Ads to Promote COVID Vaccines, Social Distancing The CDC also emailed a list of links to Facebook officials to flag as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d The agency said that it observed considerable \u201cmisinformation\u201d on topics relating to COVID vaccine shedding and microchips that they wanted to censor.14 The documents also show an e-mail in which Facebook officials offered $15 million worth of Facebook advertisement credits as a \u201cnon-monetary gift\u201d to HHS and CDC for messages relating to vaccines, social distancing and travel.15 In another e-mail, the CDC asked Google officials to promote their new website on COVID vaccines to appear first on their search engine. In another e-mail, the CDC requested Google to post an advertisement for a job position at the CDC.16 Request for Investigation Into CDC & Big Tech\u2019s \u201cCovert Propaganda\u201d Campaign On Aug. 2, 2022, AFL wrote a letter to Christi A. Grimm, Inspector General of HHS requesting an investigation into the collaboration between the CDC and social media companies. The letter states: Accordingly, we now write to request that your office investigate the U.S. Department of Health Human Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d) to determine whether the Department, through its agency the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d), has colluded with social media companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and digital marketing firms, including Reingold, to unlawfully disseminate covert propaganda.17 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/07\/canadians-may-have-to-get-covid-booster-shot-every-nine-months\/",
        "text":"On July 4, 2022, Canadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Canadians may be required to get a COVID-19 booster shot every nine months to protect themselves against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Duclos said, \u201cThe virus evolves and Omicron made us aware we will never be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We have to maintain our vaccinations up to date.\u201d1 Currently in Canada, \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is defined by Health Canada as having two doses of any of the public health agency\u2019s approved COVID vaccine.2 \u201cFully Vaccinated\u201d Makes No Sense Anymore Says Canadian Health Minister Minister Duclos\u2019 message may be directed to people who have not received their first booster.3 Government officials in Canada have said that, as of June 19, 2022, almost 81 percent of the total population has received the first two COVID shots but only 49 percent of the population has received a booster shot.4 Colin Furness, PhD, an epidemiologist from the University of Toronto and Nazeem Muhajarine, PhD, an epidemiologist from University of Saskatchewan, said that uptake for the third dose of a COVID shot has been slow in comparison to that of the first and second doses due to the fact that the vaccine was initially presented to the public as being comprised of two doses, giving people the idea that was all they needed to do to prevent having a serious case of COVID disease.5 Dr. Furness said: That\u2019s the mental model that most people had. So when we started to say you kind of need a third dose now \u2026 [they] said, \u2018You sold us an idea that there was a two-dose vaccine and I signed on, now you\u2019re changing the deal and I don\u2019t like that, I\u2019m walking away.\u20196 When asked if the COVID vaccine mandate would return in the fall of 2022, Minister Duclos responded: We must continue to fight against COVID. We want to be prepared for next fall, and that requires an up-to-date vaccination, which is based on the nine months.7 Minister Duclos also made it clear that no one is \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d anymore. He said: Nine months is very clear and will help people understand why \u2018up-to-date\u2019 is the right way to think about vaccination now. Fully vaccinated\u2019 makes no sense now. It\u2019s about \u2018up-to-date.\u2019 So am I up-to-date in my vaccination? Have I received a vaccination in the last nine months?\u201d He added that, \u201cUp-to-date\u2019 means you have received your last dose in the past nine months. If you\u2019ve already received a first booster, that\u2019s great. Please see if you\u2019re eligible for a second or third booster to remain up-to-date.8 Majority of Canadians Willing to Get a COVID Booster According to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) conducted in the fall of 2021, 86 percent of Canadians aged 12 and older reported that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to get a COVID booster shot.9 The survey showed differences across different populations with respect to willingness to receive a COVID booster dose. From September to mid-November 2021, women were slightly more likely than men to report being willing to get a booster dose (87 percent versus 85 percent). Among youth aged 12 to 17.84 percent reported a willingness to get a booster, which was similar to adults aged 18 to 49 (83 percent). Older Canadians aged 50 and older reported higher booster dose willingness (89 percent) compared with the younger age groups.10 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "title":"COVID Vaccination May Impair Innate Immune Function",
        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/08\/covid-vaccination-may-impair-innate-immune-function\/",
        "text":"Epidemiologist and researcher, Paul Alexander, PhD warns that COVID-19 vaccination could permanently damage the innate immune system in children and prevent it from functioning and developing normally.1 The innate (cellular) immune system acts as the first line of defense against the challenge of pathogens causing infectious disease. When the innate immune system identifies pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites or toxins, it activates cells to attack and resist or repair damage.2 Exposure to pathogens trains the innate immune system to work properly and this training period during early childhood is integral to the development and maturation of the innate immune system. Dr. Alexander maintains that, when young children are given a COVID shot that uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, their innate immune systems do not have the opportunity to learn how to properly respond. He contends that the vaccine antibodies bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019s spike protein and prevent the innate immune system from doing its job. When the innate immune system is not able to develop naturally and learn how to differentiate between a normal cell and a pathogen, it can lead to autoimmune disorders.3 Dr. Alexander warned: So, it is absolutely critical that the innate immune system, and particularly the innate antibodies very early on in childhood, be allowed this training.4 A well-functioning innate immune system is critical to the body\u2019s effective response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 2021 study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight showed that children infected with COVID-19 fared better than infected adults because their innate immune prevented the virus from spreading.5 The study looked at 27 adults and 12 children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that the children\u2019s innate immune system mounted a better response to the virus than the adults. The children displayed, \u201ca more vigorous early mucosal immune response\u201d than the adults, allowing them to recover from the virus faster.6 Changes to the Immune System Could Cause the Proliferation of Cancer Cells A June 2022 study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology reported that COVID vaccination causes a significant change in type 1 interferon (INF type 1) signaling, initiates changes in short- and long-term immune competence and normal cellular function, and plays, \u201ca critical role in both controlling viral proliferation and inducing antibody production.\u201d7 The study points out that INF 1 cells stop the growth of virus and cancer cells and are critical for the immune system to successfully fight viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Because the COVID vaccination has been shown to interfere with the proper functioning of INF 1, the study authors, which include Stephanie Seneff, PhD, are concerned that patients who received the vaccine may be more susceptable to catching the virus in the first two weeks immediately after vaccination.8 They said the COVID shot could also interfere with the immune system\u2019s recognition of and response to cancer cells because INF subtypes are especially important in preventing and recognizing cancer cells once they have formed.9 SAR-CoV-2 Spike Protein in COVID Shots and BRCA2 Associated Cancers The study authors argue that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein found in the COVID vaccines affects host cell exome production and causes the cells to create microRNA exomes that suppress the production of IRF9 and increase pro-inflammatory gene transcripts.10 They write: IRF9 suppression via exosomal microRNA should also be expected to impair the cancer-protective effects of BRCA2 gene activity, which depends on that molecule for its activity \u2026 BRCA2-associated cancers include breast, fallopian tube, and ovarian cancer for women, prostate and breast cancer for men, acute myeloid leukaemia in children, and others.11 Given the universally recognized importance of optimally functioning BRCA1\/2 for cancer prevention and given the central role of the TRAIL signal transduction pathway for additional cancer surveillance, the suppression of IRF7 and IRF9 through vaccination and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein production is extremely concerning for long-term cancer control in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA genetic vaccine injected populations.12 European Medicines Agency Issues Warning About Repeat Booster Doses A study published in The Lancet provided evidence that immune function can be adversely affected by COVID vaccines. According to the study, those who received two doses of the vaccine had lower immune function after eight months than those who did not take the vaccine.13 One proposed cause of the decreased immune function is that N1 methylpseudouridine, which is part of the vaccine\u2019s genetic code, could activate regulatory T cells and lead to lowered cellular immunity, which can prevent spike proteins from immediately decaying and, instead, circulating through the body for at least four months after vaccination. The authors note that lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA are inflammatory and have also been shown to accumulate in the ovaries, adrenal glands, liver and spleen, with the spike protein potentially causing vascular endothelial cells to be damaged and affect immune system organs.14 Adverse effects of COVID vaccines was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which recommended that frequent COVID vaccine boosters could negatively impact immune responses to the virus. The agency said that the booster doses should be spaced out further than every four months. The head of EMA\u2019s office of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, Marco Cavaleri, PhD, warned, We are rather concerned about a strategy that entangles repeated vaccinations within a short term. We cannot really continuously give booster doses every 3-4 months\u2026 There are two concerns here: If we have a strategy in which we give boosters, let\u2019s say, every four months approximately, we will end up potentially having problems with the immune response, and the immune response may not be as good as we would like it to be. So we should be careful in not overloading the immune system with repeated immunization. \u201cAnd secondly, there is the risk of fatigue in the population with the continuous administration of boosters.\u201d15 Reinhard Obst, PhD, professor at Ludwig Maximilian University\u2019s Institute of Immunology in Germany, believes that Dr. Cavaleri\u2019s warning is reasonable. He said: The idea of vaccinating every four months or even more than that is novel. It\u2019s something that you haven\u2019t seen with other types of viruses. And the idea of T cell exhaustion is the reason why you might pause.16 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "title":"Doctor in India Sues Government Over COVID-19 Vaccine",
        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/05\/doctor-in-india-sues-government-over-covid-19-vaccine\/",
        "text":"Jacob Puliyel, MD, a pediatrician in India for more than 40 years, brought suit in the Supreme Court of India against the Union of India and COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in a legal challenge to the country\u2019s COVID vaccine program.1 Dr. Puliyel, who has served as Director of Research and Projects at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi and is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) on immunizations in India, sued the government and COVID vaccine manufacturers seeking release of information related to the COVID vaccine approval process, as well as arguing for a policy change that allows unvaccinated persons to enter public spaces and access resources. Specifically, Dr. Puliyel asked the Supreme Court of India for the release of each phase of clinical trial data for the COVID vaccines administered in India; disclosure of minutes from the meeting of the Subject Expert Committee and the NTGAI with regard to vaccines; release of information surrounding the approval or rejection of emergency use applications of vaccines by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and disclosure of post vaccination data related to COVID. He also asked the court to declare that all COVID vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and a violation of h2citizen\u2019s rights. Dr. Puliyel: COVID Vaccines Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission In support of his request, Dr. Puliyel submitted affidavits to the court stating that natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 is superior to vaccine acquired immunity and that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID. News articles were submitted to show that two-thirds of the population in India had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have antibodies to the virus, and that the vaccinated were susceptible to breakthrough infections. Dr. Puliyel also argued that vaccine mandates and restrictions on the unvaccinated are meaningless because the virus is transmitted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. The government maintained that the COVID vaccines administered in India, Covaxin and Covishield, are needed to combat the global pandemic threat. They also maintained that trial data cannot be released to the public due to privacy concerns; that information regarding adverse events has already been released; that vaccination remains voluntary for all citizens, and that restrictions on the unvaccinated were necessary to protect the public health. Respondent COVID vaccine manufacturers argued that they followed strict guidelines for government approval of their COVID vaccines. The Union of India strongly opposed this lawsuit, claiming that the publicity could increase vaccine hesitancy and endanger the public health, and that public health matters should not be interfered with by the court. However, because Dr. Puliyel brought this lawsuit in the interest of the public and because he is considered a subject matter expert, the Court determined the case would be heard for the welfare of the public. The Supreme Court of India Looked to High Courts in Other Countries The government made their argument relying on prominent cases in India, as well as U.S. cases, such as Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Zucht v. King; Biden vs. Missouri, and Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo. The court also looked to New South Wales for guidance, finding that the Supreme Court in Assam v. Hazzard held that it was not the court\u2019s role to determine the effectiveness of the government\u2019s regulations or whether the regulations were the best response to the risks COVID posed to the public, instead the New South Whales Supreme Court emphasized that their only role was to determine the legal validity of the Minister\u2019s orders. Reviewing India\u2019s case history, the Court summarized its role in reviewing policy decisions: to check whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary\u201d but not to, \u201csubstitute their own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper. 2 In Distribution of Essential Supplies & Services during Pandemic, the Court determined that it would not, \u201csecond guess\u201d the policy experts, but would \u201cexercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons.\u201d3 Court Found Forced Vaccination Violates the Constitution of India In considering the global pandemic, the court said that it could not find fault with the government\u2019s vaccination drive, citing the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2; the approximate loss of 5,23,843 lives from the virus in India; and the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), TAG-CO-VAC and SAGE that vaccination would provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. However, regarding the issue of the right of individual privacy verses the government restricting individual rights in the name of public health, the Supreme Court of India found that forced vaccination is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court previously found in Article 21 a right to personal autonomy, which extends to the right to refuse medical treatment. In balancing the state\u2019s interest in public health and an individual\u2019s right to personal autonomy, the court found that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution grants individuals the right to determine how they should live their own life, which includes the right to refuse medical treatment such as vaccination. However, when there is a likelihood that an individual could spread the virus to other people, the state\u2019s interest in protecting the public allows the government to impose certain restrictions on individual rights, as long as such restrictions are reasonable, in proportion to the objective sought, and reviewable by the courts. Accordingly, the Court found that the government\u2019s restrictions are a valid exercise of power, despite evidence that an unvaccinated person is no more likely to spread the Delta or Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus than a vaccinated person. The Court: COVID Vaccination Policy in India Not Unreasonable In support of his case, Dr. Puliyel presented scientific journals showing that patients who recovered from COVID still had antibodies 11 months after infection. He also pointed out that countries with a higher percent of the population vaccinated have a higher rate of COVID per one million people. He said that a vaccine surveillance report in the United Kingdom showed that, in week 40, there was a negative efficacy of the vaccine in those over the age of 30. The court confirmed that its only role is to determine whether the Union of India took into consideration scientific research when establishing its policy advocating COVID vaccination for the entire country. The court acknowledged that large portions of the public cannot be considered healthy because they suffer from chronic disease and lack of nutrition, especially the elderly population, and that the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy was rightly centered around large segments of more vulnerable people, rather than a minority who are healthy as the subjects in the scientific articles that Dr. Puliyel presented to support the efficacy of natural immunity. Accordingly, the court found that the COVID vaccination policy of India was made in the interest of public health and is not unreasonable. The Court: Vaccinated Population a Source of Virus Transmission Considering the fact that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated pose nearly the same risk of transmitting the virus, the court looked at whether the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy of restricting unvaccinated persons from accessing public resources amounted to discrimination. Dr. Puliyel presented a letter published in the Lancet finding that peak viral load of COVID did not differ either by vaccination status or by variant; that the secondary infection rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated households only differed by two percent, and that four of the five most vaccinated countries were categorized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high transmission countries. In addition, he submitted a study conducted in Massachusetts in July 2021 demonstrating that, after attending public gatherings, 346 out of 469 COVID cases (74 percent) were among vaccinated persons. Presented with this data, the court concluded: It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.4 The court admitted that vaccine mandates may have been found to be constitutional prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that do not appear to respond to COVID vaccines. However, now that vaccinated persons present nearly the same risk of transmission as unvaccinated persons, the court said that restrictions placed on the unvaccinated are not in proportion to the risk they pose to public health.4 The court wrote: While there is abundant data to show that getting vaccinated continues to be the dominant expert advice even in the face of new variants, no submission nor any data has been put forth to justify restrictions only on unvaccinated individuals when emerging scientific evidence appears to indicate that the risk of transmission of the virus from unvaccinated individuals is almost on par with that from vaccinated persons. To put it differently, neither the Union of India nor the State Governments have produced any material before this court to justify the discriminatory treatment of unvaccinated individuals in public places by imposition of vaccine mandates\u201d5 The court suggested that all authorities, public, private and educational, review their current orders that restrict an unvaccinated person\u2019s access to public services and resources. The Court: Government Followed Approval Process for COVID Vaccines Dr. Puliyel asserted that the government rushed the approval of COVID vaccines in, \u201ca hurried and opaque manner.\u201d6 He said that the trial data, regulatory approvals, and minutes from meetings approving the vaccine have not been publicly disclosed, which demonstrates a lack of transparency in the approval process, and that, while the complete data sets may not be available yet, releasing preliminary COVID vaccine adverse event data would allow individuals to make an informed vaccination decision. The court disagreed, finding that the government\u2019s approval for emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccines was properly made in accordance with the statutory regime in place. In India, all new drug trials must follow a certain protocol with stringent statutory requirements as set forth in the Good Clinical Practices guidelines and be approved by the Ethics Committee and the Central Licensing Authority. The Ethics Committee, which is comprised of medical, scientific and non-medical and nonscientific members, is an independent review board that is tasked with providing an objective and independent review of the clinical trials. The Union of India claimed that these strict clinical trial guidelines were followed for COVID vaccine clinical trials and that the main findings of trials have been published in a peer reviewed journal, in accordance with WHO requirements. The Court: Ongoing COVID Vaccine Trial Data Must Be Publicly Available The court agreed with the government and declined to mandate the disclosure of segregated clinical trial data, citing privacy reasons, and also declined to declare that COVID vaccine approvals were granted without proper review of clinical trial data. However, the court ordered that relevant data, which must be published under statutory regimes and WHO requirements for ongoing clinical trials, along with data from COVID vaccine post-marketing trials, be made available to the public without delay. Dr. Puliyel advised the court that, because clinical trials are made up of a small subset of the population, not all adverse events may be seen during trials and, instead, may only be noticed once the vaccine is available to the public at large. He pointed out that, in 2018, the WHO changed the way it classified adverse events after vaccination to only consider adverse events as vaccine related when that same adverse reaction also occurred during previous smaller, limited clinical trials. In other words: Reactions observed during post-marketing surveillance are not considered as \u2018consistent with causal association with vaccine\u2019, if a significant increase in such reactions during Phase III trials had not been recorded.7 In the case of the COVID vaccine trials, phase III trials were cut short and then control subjects were offered the vaccine, which had the effect of diluting the control group and ultimately making it impossible to evaluate potential differences in long term health outcomes between the vaccinated and control groups. At the same time, it makes it more possible for doctors to dismiss adverse events that occur post COVID vaccination, as adverse events are less likely to be considered vaccine related events. Therefore, Dr. Puliyel asked that all post marketing adverse event data be made available to the public. However, the court declined to act, finding that the Phase III trials were cut short on the advice of the SEC, and stating that the government has protocols in place to consider and investigate adverse reactions to COVID vaccine, which only occur during the post-marketing phase. Dr. Puliyel: India\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System Should Be More Like VAERS Dr. Puliyel contended that the vaccine adverse events reporting system in India is not transparent and complete data as on serious adverse events should be published like in the United States though the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The court pointed out that the National AEFI Surveillance Secretariat, which has been in place for a decade, has a protocol in place for identifying and monitoring adverse events to vaccination. However, Dr. Puliyel argued that the vaccine adverse event reporting system in India needs to be changed to allow individuals, as well as private doctors, to report adverse events like is done in the U.S. with VAERS. The court agreed and directed the Union of India to facilitate the reporting of vaccine adverse events by individuals, as well as private doctors, on a public on-line platform. The court said: Information relating to adverse effects following immunisation is crucial for the purpose of understanding the safety of the vaccines that are being administered, apart from being instrumental in further scientific studies around the pandemic. There is an imminent need for collection of requisite data of adverse events and wider participation of people in reporting the adverse events is necessary for the purpose of gathering correct information.8 The Court: Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination Program Will Stand Dr. Puliyel presented evidence that children are not at high risk of severe illness from COVID and argued that the risk from COVID vaccination outweighs the risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, pointing out that a large number of children in India have already recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The court sided with the government, stating that it would not second-guess expert opinion as to the safety of pediatric COVID vaccinations. However, the court ordered the Union of India to immediately release the key findings and clinical trial results of Corbevax, the COVID vaccine that does not use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is being given to children, if that data has not already been released. The Supreme Court of India acknowledged that citizens have a liberty interest that prohibits forced vaccination; that restrictions placed on unvaccinated persons should be reviewed in light of the fact that the COVID vaccine does not prevent infection and transmission; that ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trial data should be publicly released, and that the government\u2019s vaccine adverse event reporting system should be improved. However, the court did not fully recognize and adequately respond to all of Dr. Puliyel\u2019s legitimate complaints about the government\u2019s COVID vaccination program.

        "text":"Pediatrician Paul Halczenko, MD awaits a decision in an appeal he filed against Ascension Health, his employer for the last ten years. Dr. Halczenko and four other health care workers, were put on leave from their job at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital after refusing to be vaccinated for COVID-19 for religious reasons when it was mandated as a condition of employment for 14,700 employees in Indiana.1 2 Dr. Halczenko is one of only three pediatric intensive care unit doctors in Indiana. He and four other health care workers sued Ascension and St. Vincent Hospital for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \u201cby systematically and callously failing to accommodate their religious beliefs and denying their requests for exemption without giving individualized consideration of, or individualized responses to, each request.\u201d3 Doctor Alleges Religious Discrimination The four other health care workers who filed suit along with the doctor were allowed to return to work when Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate in December 2021. However, Dr. Halczenko, who works in critical care for pediatric patients, was told that he was not allowed to return to work.4 William Bock III, attorney for the doctor, points out that no reason was given as to why the doctor was singled out and prevented from returning to work along with the other previously suspended workers. He said: We have no explanation for why Dr. Halczenko is treated differently. We believe that it\u2019s religious discrimination.5 Dr. Halczenko argued that, should he not be granted a preliminary injunction and be allowed to return to work, his skills as a highly specialized pediatric intensive care doctor as well as his reputation would suffer irreparable harm. However, Judge James Patrick Hanlon denied the doctor\u2019s request for a temporary injunction stating that he found that the doctor, \u201chas failed to make a \u2018substantial showing\u2019 of irreparable injury\u201d that would necessitate him being reinstated in his position by way of a temporary injunction.6 The court stated that, should he prevail on the Title VII claims, Dr. Halczenko could ultimately be made whole without the court issuing a preliminary injunction.7 At the same time, the court noted that Ascension provided almost no supporting evidence as to the reason why the doctor\u2019s religious exemption was denied, but concluded that the defendant\u2019s motivation behind the denial of the accommodation is not a matter to be resolved at a preliminary injunction hearing. Doctor Argues the COVID Vaccine Does Not Prevent Transmission of Infection The judge, failing to find that the doctor\u2019s reputation would suffer an irreparable injury as a result of being put on administrative leave due to his religious beliefs, wrote: And, here the claimed reputational injury\u2014and corresponding impediment to finding a comparable job\u2014would arise from the undisputed, truthful fact that Dr. Halczenko\u2019s employment was terminated because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19\u201d8 Dr. Halczenko defended his position, saying: Well, first I would say I am following the science. The preponderance of the evidence suggests and even as we know no \u2014not necessarily at the time of the lawsuit, but certainly in the intervening weeks and months\u2014that vaccination does not actually prevent transmission. So, the best protection that I can offer to my patients is to use the personal protective equipment and the other measures that are employed by health care workers across the world and have been demonstrated to be effective.9 Ascension responded to these allegations\u2026 It is in the public\u2019s interest to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of serious illness to St. Vincent\u2019s patients, employees, and visitors. This public interest in reducing the risk of transmission among patients and employees outweighs any interest asserted by Halczenko.10 This matter was heard before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 31 and a decision is pending.11 Ascension Health Faces More Lawsuits Due to Its COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate A group of 64 health care workers are also suing Ascension Health and St. Vincent Hospital in a class action lawsuits for having been suspended without pay after they refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The employees objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and filed religious exemption to the vaccine mandate. The employees argue that Ascension failed to properly assess each individual religious exemption application.[12] The lawsuit alleges: Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will.13 The employees were suspended without pay beginning Nov. 12, 2021 and told that, if they failed to get the vaccine by Jan. 4, 2022, they would be fired. In December, Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate and allowed the employees who filed a religious exemption to return to work. The employees are requesting that Ascension be found guilty of violating federal discrimination laws and be ordered to pay them for the time they were suspended, as well as other compensation.14 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Opinion | America\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u2019 founder Simone Gold was sentenced to serve 60 days in prison and ordered to pay a $9,500 fine for her involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 event. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, DC also sentenced Dr. Simone Gold to 12 months of supervised release after her 60-day prison term is served. The following is a statement released by America\u2019s Frontline Doctors prior to the sentencing on June 16, 2022. Six months after America\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u2019 viral video of their press conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court on July 27, 2020, Founder Dr. Simone Gold traveled to a free speech rally in Washington, DC, to speak on January 6, 2021. In the months between the press conference and January 6th, Dr. Gold was asked to present publicly on numerous occasions about physicians\u2019 free speech and her experience of being fired for prescribing early treatment to COVID-19 patients. By this time, she had also founded America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a division of the Free Speech Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. Dr. Gold was scheduled to speak on January 6th alongside numerous other presenters after President Trump\u2019s appearance at the rally, which had a government approved permit. At her expected start time, Dr. Gold was then told all speeches were suddenly canceled without explanation. Upon hearing this, Dr. Gold was amongst thousands swept into the Capitol building when the doors were opened from the inside, with law enforcement officers ushering people in. While there, Dr. Gold realized it was the only remaining moment to deliver her message to those who came to hear it, and so she gave her remarks there. When an officer instructed her to move towards an exit, she complied, and shortly after when asked to leave the building entirely, she did so. The media coverage after January 6th showed carefully selected edits of violent scenes, but that was not Dr. Gold\u2019s observation of the day. Subsequently, Dr. Gold was arrested and prosecuted along with hundreds of other non-violent citizens for being present at the Capitol. Dr. Gold reached a plea agreement for entering a restricted building. Her sentencing is scheduled today, June 16, 2022. Dr. Gold did express regret for being involved in a situation that later became unpredictable, but what she is facing are the consequences of exercising free speech in today\u2019s America. Like most January 6th defendants, she is a victim of selective prosecution\u2014a defining feature of corrupted governments, and a direct violation of the equal protection guarantee of the US Constitution. For example, consider that there were hundreds of arrests for violent protests in association with President Trump\u2019s Inauguration in 2017. The government subsequently dropped all of those charges, including charges against people who were actually disrupting Congress from inside the Congressional gallery while Congress was in session. But with the January 6th arrests, the government has not only failed to drop any charges against nonviolent persons in public spaces, such as Dr. Gold, it has instead aggressively violated defendants\u2019 civil rights at nearly every turn. There are innumerable well-documented instances of January 6th defendants not receiving due process noted in the book January 6 authored by Julie Kelly. For instance, some defendants have been held in prison for nearly 18 months pretrial. In Dr. Gold\u2019s case, she peacefully gave a speech on medical freedom and Constitutional rights in the public Rotunda. This resulted in the government violently arresting her in a surprise raid, breaking the front door of her home, using over a dozen FBI and law enforcement officers with assault weapons pointed at her from two feet away. The intent to terrorize her with this tactical assault suited to a raid on a violent drug cartel was unmistakable; she suffers from PTSD to this day. Dr. Gold\u2019s peaceful exercise of her 1st Amendment rights also resulted in numerous restrictions of her personal civil liberties and severe interference with her ability to serve the millions who look to America\u2019s Frontline Doctors for life- saving information and civil rights support. This continued for over a year before any adjudication. Such inequitable treatment based upon political preference shows the collapse of the rule of law. For people interested in learning the truth about the January 6th event, please watch Capitol Punishment. In addition, the government has aggressively refrained from arresting or prosecuting certain highly visible individuals seen on videotape who waived people into the building. The government has aggressively withheld 14,000 hours of closed-circuit security footage. The government has not disclosed how many FBI agents and assets were in the crowd. And the media lied when it stated five officers were killed\u2014exactly zero officers were killed that day. The only person who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, a petite unarmed 35-year-old female military veteran posing no lethal danger, was gunned down by Michael Byrd, a Capitol police officer, who in a prior incident of severe negligence left a loaded gun with no safety in a public restroom. Byrd was never charged for Babbitt\u2019s murder. Dr. Gold remains committed to her advocacy for physicians\u2019 free speech. In quoting George Washington, she said: \u201cIf freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.\u201d For over two years now, We The People have been under attack. Our Constitutional rights have been increasingly trampled and eroded. The First Amendment has been annihilated. This is unprecedented in our lifetimes. A concerted effort has been undertaken to \u201ccancel\u201d physicians who do not follow the mainstream narrative. Dr. Gold has been targeted by these attacks since the White Coat Summit in July 2020 when she shared the news of lifesaving medications alongside many esteemed colleagues, now numbering in the tens of thousands. The California Medical Board subsequently threatened Dr. Gold\u2019s license with an unfounded claim she was sharing \u201cdangerous disinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, data continues to grow in overwhelming support of her positions with every passing week. The attempted silencing of this one doctor was just a preamble for what is to come throughout the nation. California AB 2098, an official government censorship bill, has just been passed through the CA State Assembly. This outrageous bill puts a gag order on doctors in exchange for a California medical license. Without a license, a doctor cannot practice medicine. When a doctor has a license revoked in any state, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for that doctor to obtain a license in another state. This is career-ending. Further, AB 2098 proposes to violate the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship and create a new category of \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d against doctors who provide education and early treatment for COVID-19. AFLDS has prepared a comprehensive Issue Brief on AB 2098. Issue Brief \u2013 CA AB 2098 | America\u2019s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS.org As we consider the results of Dr. Gold\u2019s sentencing, one thing is clear. We are still far from the change that is needed. The Constitution is crumbling before us, and we must continue to stand for what is right. We will never cower to government threats and harassment. Dr. Gold risked her career when she stood against the mainstream narrative to save lives. Now, she still stands, risking her freedom, to choose what is right over what is comfortable. We must learn to be so bold and continue to stand together against the growing tyranny we face. This article was reprinted with the author\u2019s permission.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2021\/07\/journal-article-questioning-covid-vaccination-protocols-retracted\/",
        "text":"A scholarly article published in a medical journal, in which authors concluded that a \u201clack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy,\u201d has been retracted less than two weeks after publication. The article entitled \u201cThe Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations\u2014We Should Rethink the Policy\u201d was published by MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) on June 24, 2021 and analyzed the information from international databases. The article was retracted on July 2.1 The article\u2019s authors used a large Israeli field study that included approximately one million people to calculate the number of individuals needed to vaccinate in order to prevent one infection and death caused by COVID-19. They then extracted numbers of side effects reported to the Dutch National Register for the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines to calculate risk. Their findings indicated that \u201cfor three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination\u2026 thus placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude.\u201d1 Underplaying Adverse Reactions by National Authorities and Media Outlets The article\u2019s authors suggested that \u201cperhaps it might be necessary to dampen the enthusiasm with sober facts,\u201d1 stating the need for independent science case reviews of severe reactions, reconsideration of national policies, and evidence-based recommendations for vaccination on an individual case-by-case basis. This stance is echoed in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article, which criticizes the lack of media representation about the potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the politicization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccine. The authors state that public health authorities are risking the public\u2019s trust by not being forthcoming about potential harms from the vaccine, and that \u201cthe battle to recover scientific honesty will be an uphill one in the U.S.\u201d2 Researchers Resign Following Widespread Criticism and Article Retraction The website Gizmodo was quick to publish an article entitled \u201cJournal Retracts Terrible Study that Claimed Widespread Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths\u201d two days following retraction of the journal article.3 The Gizmodo author states that the article was condemned as flawed and irresponsible by other scientists and that the well-respected researchers have since resigned from association with the journal. Following criticism, the journal article was retracted after the journal\u2019s editors said they found \u201cseveral errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.\u201d3 Mainstream Media Alleges VAERS is Source of \u201cMisinformation\u201d Gizmodo reports that adverse reporting systems such as the one used by the researchers who published the retracted article are designed to report any health problem or death after using a new drug or vaccine, but that the reports don\u2019t necessarily indicate the drug or vaccine caused the health problem or death. The Gizmodo article author states: But caution should be warranted if someone starts making extraordinary claims about safety or lack thereof\u2014especially if those claims are based on adverse event reporting systems.3 Vaccine adverse event reporting systems, which many people did not know existed prior to the dissemination of experimental COVID-19 vaccines under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020,4 increasingly have been criticized by the media as the numbers of serious health problem have been reported following COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite being credited for identifying the blood clots associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine5 and myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines,6 many news outlets report that the U.S. based system VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is a tool used by those opposed to mandatory use of COVID-19 vaccine to emphasize vaccine risks and that the system is \u201cripe for abuse, misuse, and plain misunderstanding.\u201d5 The CDC\u2019s website describing VAERS clearly identifies limitations of using VAERS data to make conclusions about causal relationships between an adverse event report filed in VAERS and the vaccination(s) received. However, CDC officials also urge vaccine providers and recipients to report adverse events following vaccination to VAERS as required under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.7 There have been more adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations than for any other vaccine.8 Most mainstream media outlets promoting the use of COVID-19 vaccine are critical of VAERS and minimize the significance of adverse event reports filed in VAERS. As ABC News states: \u201cAlthough VAERS contains millions of reports of injuries following vaccinations, the vast majority of those injuries are coincidental.\u201d5 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/08\/death-in-south-africa-causally-linked-to-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine\/",
        "text":"On Aug. 4, 2022, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) reported the death of an individual in South Africa shortly after receiving Johnson & Johnson\/Janssen\u2019s adenovirus vectored Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine. The agency stated that the death was causally linked to the vaccine.1 2 3 4 5 The name and age of the person who died was withheld for reasons of confidentiality, and death occurred after the polio-like neurological disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) developed soon after the vaccination. The individual was placed on a ventilator and subsequently died.2 \u201c[GBS] can be mild but it can also lead to either rapid or progressive weakness and has the potential to affect the respiratory system,\u201d said Marc Blockman, MBChB, MMED, professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital. \u201cIt could be caused by bacterial or viral infections and certain medicines or vaccines could predispose patients to develop the syndrome. We were acutely aware of it and it was part of the vigilance plan.\u201d1 7 Other Possible Cases of GBS in South Africa After J&J COVID Shot This GBS case developing after COVID vaccination is one out of about 160 deaths possibly associated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccinations in South Africa. It was the only one reviewed by SAHPRA and determined to be caused by the vaccine. In the other cases, the deaths reportedly were believed by health officials to have been coincidental.1 5 \u201cAt the time of illness no other cause for the Guillain-Barre syndrome could be identified,\u201d said Professor Hannelie Meyer, MSc, PhD, head of the South African Vaccination and Immunisation Centre (SAVIC) at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Pretoria. \u201cThe person presented with the symptoms shortly after vaccination and this had led to prolonged hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and further infections.\u201d1 2 7 FDA Warns of GBS Risk With J&J COVID Vaccine The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has also been associated with GBS in the United States. On July 12, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to the fact sheet for Ad26.COV2.S following reports of 100 cases of GBS among those who received the vaccine. Nine-five of those cases were apparently severe enough to require hospitalization, and one of those individuals died. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most of the cases were \u201creported about two weeks after vaccination and mostly in males, many aged 50 years and older.\u201d8 9 10 The head of SAHPRA, Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela, PhD, MMFI, said that investigations of other deaths in South Africa that may be linked to the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are ongoing. Nicholas Crisp, MD, the deputy director-general of South Africa\u2019s National Department of Health, said that a government compensation fund for people harmed by COVID-19 vaccinations has received 75 claims and additional cases are being investigated.1 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"After more than two years of missteps and backpedaling over Covid-19 guidance that had a profound effect on Americans' lives, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced on Wednesday that the agency would undergo a complete overhaul - and will revamp everything from its operations to its culture after failing to meet expectations during the pandemic, Bloomberg reports. Director Rochelle Walensky began telling CDC\u2019s staff Wednesday that the changes are aimed at replacing the agency\u2019s insular, academic culture with one that\u2019s quicker to respond to emergencies. That will mean more rapidly turning research into health recommendations, working better with other parts of government and improving how the CDC communicates with the public. -Bloomberg \"For 75 years, CDC and public health have been preparing for Covid-19, and in our big moment, our performance did not reliably meet expectations,\" said Director Rochelle Walensky. \"I want us all to do better and it starts with CDC leading the way. My goal is a new, public health action-oriented culture at CDC that emphasizes accountability, collaboration, communication and timeliness.\" As Bloomberg further notes, The agency has been faulted for an inadequate testing and surveillance program, for not collecting important data on how the virus was spreading and how vaccines were performing, for being too under the influence of the White House during the Trump administration and for repeated challenges communicating to a politically divided and sometimes skeptical public.\" A few examples: Walensky made the announcement in a Wednesday morning video message to CDC staff, where she said that the US has 'significant work to do' in order to improve the country's public health defenses. \"Prior to this pandemic, our infrastructure within the agency and around the country was too frail to tackle what we confronted with Covid-19,\" she said. \"To be frank, we are responsible for some pretty dramatic, pretty public mistakes \u2014 from testing, to data, to communications.\" Expired: Trust the science Wired: Trust the restructuring https:\/\/t.co\/JL4G0JQOel \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 17, 2022 The CDC overhaul comes on the heels of the agency admitting that \"unvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people\" - and that those exposed to COVID-19 are no longer required to quarantine.",

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain. That work has been underway and the next step is for the FDA and CDC to review data from the companies, once they\u2019ve received it. The rollout was expected sometime in September, but Jha\u2019s estimate on Tuesday was the most specific to date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to know more about this in the upcoming weeks and these vaccines will become available by early to mid-September,\u201d Jha said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, again including the caveat that FDA and CDC need to act before anything can be official. \u201cBut the big picture, bottom line, is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd those vaccines are coming very, very soon.\u201d So far the U.S. has contracted for 105 million doses of the newly-updated boosters from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna, the two leading COVID vaccine manufacturers for the country. Both contracts with Pfizer and Moderna include an option for hundreds of millions of more doses down the line, should the U.S. secure the money. Between Pfizer and Moderna, if both companies were able to complete their orders, the U.S. would have about 171 million doses of the new shots. But more than 260 million Americans have had at least one vaccine dose already and would theoretically consider getting a booster. (Source.) The problem is that those who want COVID-19 vaccines are a dwindling market, partly because millions of people in the U.S. have now been crippled or have died after taking the vaccines for the past 20 months, according to the CDC and FDA\u2019s own statistics in the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS). There are more deaths and injuries following emergency-use authorized experimental COVID-19 vaccines in 20 months than have been recorded in VAERS for the previous 30 years following all FDA-approved vaccines. That\u2019s not a very good repeat business model, when so many of your patients are dying and becoming crippled. And it is estimated that only 1% of all vaccine injuries and deaths are reported to VAERS, which would put the number of Americans injured by a COVID-19 vaccine at around 138 million, with around 3 million deaths. The ABC report acknowledged that this is a dwindling market: \u2026 demand for boosters has dropped with each campaign for people to get another shot. About 108 million people have received their first booster shot, for example. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCOVID Data Tracker,\u201d 261,981,618 people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 107,872,738 people have received a first booster, and only 35,200,364 have received a second booster. This is a diminishing market, and I am quite sure that the majority of the 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses will probably never be used. Millions of doses of previous COVID vaccines have already been discarded due to lack of demand and exceeding their expiration dates, but that has not stopped Pfizer and Moderna from recording record profits, even when their vaccines don\u2019t sell and are thrown away. While new polls show flatlining concern about the pandemic among Americans, Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine business continues quietly churning in the background. But amid a recent decline in vaccine demand, the company has written off a sizable chunk of inventory. In its second-quarter results announcement, Moderna said it wrote off $499 million in inventories \u201crelated to COVID-19 products that have exceeded or are expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\u201d In addition, the company took a $184 million charge because of changes in prior purchase commitments, and it recorded an expense of $131 million for \u201cunutilized external manufacturing capacity.\u201d (Source.) Reducing the Population of the Earth is the Goal So why would Big Pharma continue with a product that is killing and injuring so many people, and significantly reducing their market among the pro-vaxxers? The answer, which should be obvious to all by now, at least for those who have refused the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d and can still think for themselves, is that this is part of a global plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d from climate change. Along with reducing the world\u2019s population is a plan that is currently in place, and can especially be seen in Holland right now, to dramatically reduce the world food production as well. Bill Gates is the Billionaire Globalist who has been pushing this agenda for decades now, and a report published in ZeroHedge News today also identifies Bill Gates as the primary influence behind the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d that was just recently put into law. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 which according to the Congressional Budget Office will raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $20 billion \u2013 not to mention unleash an army of IRS agents on working class Americans over the next decade, was made possible by Bill Gates and (in smaller part) Larry Summers, who have been known to hang out together. Pals hanging out The bill, of course, was signed yesterday. This is what dementia looks like: pic.twitter.com\/e9fof5l4RS \u2014 End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) August 16, 2022 In a Tuesday Bloomberg article that reads more like a newsletter for the Gates fan club, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder recalls how earlier this year, as moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema continued to block the tax-and-spend legislation over concerns that it would raise taxes on the middle class (it will), Gates says he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d been cultivating since at least 2019. Gates was banking on more than just his trademark optimism about addressing climate change and other seemingly intractable problems that have been his focus since stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive two decades ago. As he revealed to Bloomberg Green, he has quietly lobbied Manchin and other senators, starting before President Joe Biden had won the White House, in anticipation of a rare moment in which heavy federal spending might be secured for the clean-energy transition. Those discussions gave him reason to believe the senator from West Virginia would come through for the climate \u2014 and he was willing to continue pressing the case himself until the very end. \u201cThe last month people felt like, OK, we tried, we\u2019re done, it failed,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI believed it was a unique opportunity.\u201d So he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d cultivated for at least three years. \u201cWe were able to talk even at a time when he felt people weren\u2019t listening.\u201d -Bloomberg We know, gag us with a spoon. Apparently Gates and Manchin\u2019s bromance began when the billionaire wooed the West Virgina Senator at a 2019 meal in Seattle, in an effort to garner support for clean-energy policy. Manchin at the time was the senior-most Democrat on the energy committee. \u201cMy dialogue with Joe has been going on for quite a while,\u201d said Gates. After Manchin walked (again) on the bill last December over concerns that it would exacerbate the national debt, inflation, the pandemic, and amid geopolitical uncertainty with Russia, Gates jumped into action. A few weeks later, he met with Manchin and his wife, Gayle Conelly Manchin, at a DC restaurant, where they talked about what West Virginia needed. Manchin understandably wanted to preserve jobs at the center of the US coal industry, while Gates suggested that coal plant workers could simply swap over to nuclear plants \u2013 such as those from Gates\u2019 TerraPower. Manchin apparently wasn\u2019t convinced, announcing on Feb. 1 that \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d (the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s previous iteration) was \u201cdead.\u201d In an effort to convince him otherwise, Democrats pulled together a cadre of economists and other Manchin influencers \u2013 including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who convinced Manchin that the bill wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, or add to the deficit. Collin O\u2019Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation, recruited economists to assuage Manchin\u2019s concerns \u2014 including representatives from the University of Chicago and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware brought in a heavyweight: former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who has spent decades advising Democrats. The economists were able to \u201csend this signal that [the bill\u2019s] going to help with the deficit,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slightly deflationary and it\u2019s going to spur growth and investment in all these areas.\u201d Through this subtle alchemy, clean-energy investments could be reframed for Manchin as a hedge against future spikes in oil and gas prices and a way to potentially export more energy to Europe. -Bloomberg Gates also sprang into action again on July 7, when Manchin was spotted at the Sun Valley media conference in Idaho \u2013 which Gates also attended. \u201cWe had a talk about what was missing, what needed to be done,\u201d Gates said. \u201cAnd then after that it was a lot of phone calls.\u201d Gates looks back at the new law with satisfaction. He achieved what he set out to do. \u201cI will say that it\u2019s one of the happier moments of my climate work,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI have two things that excite me about climate work. One is when policy gets done well, and this is by far the biggest moment like that.\u201d His other pleasure comes from interviewing people at climate and clean-tech startups: \u201cI hear about this amazing new way to make steel, cement and chemicals.\u201d -Bloomberg \u201cI don\u2019t want to take credit for what went on,\u201d says Gates \u2013 in the article about how he gets credit for what went on. Read the full article at ZeroHedge News. The future of the United States is clearly dependent upon the actions of us \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d now, in terms of resisting the Globalists\u2019 plans, and if you have not joined our ranks yet, it is high time you did.

        "text":"Westport, CT \u2014 America is currently in utter turmoil. After panic buying emptied shelves across the country, millions of unemployed people began spending their last dollar on food, hundreds of cities have been placed on lockdown, and cops are using Chinese-made patrol drones to monitor citizens 24-hours a day. In a matter of weeks, America has shifted from the land of the free to the land of the economic collapse and newly ushered in police state. The level of fear among the populace is at an all time high and the authoritarians are exploiting it. They are using America's fear to give massive sums of money to special interests while fleecing the value of the dollar and ensuring lifetimes of debt for future generations. And, they are ushering in a police state, the likes of which we have never seen. In a time when good news is sparse, any shred of it can be inspiring. Such is the case out of Wesport, Connecticut in which resistance to the police state has paid off. When the citizens of Westport expressed their anger to the city's plan to use drone technology to spy on its citizens by making sure they are adhering to social distancing guidelines, two days later, the program was shut down. In an announcement last week, the Westport police department announced the end of the program and even cited the concerned citizens as a factor in the decision. Police Chief Foti Koskinas announced today that, after careful consideration and in collaboration with First Selectman Jim Marpe, the Westport Police Department has chosen not to participate in the Draganfly drone \u201cFlatten the Curve Pilot Program.\u201d The Department\u2019s recent announcement of its plan to partner and participate in a test of new drone technology has resulted in varied expressions of public concern and reservations. To those who have reached out directly to the police department, to the Selectman\u2019s office or otherwise made public these questions or concerns, we sincerely thank you for your continued community engagement and seek to assure you that your voices have been heard. Though the police department only claimed they would use them for monitoring crowds, as Reason.com points out, \"these drones were much more intrusive than simply looking for crowds. Draganfly's drone-mounted biometric monitoring tools are even more sinister, dystopian, and potentially abusive. The drone is able to quickly measure whether people are six feet apart from each other, and Draganfly claims it can also measure heart rate, body temperature, and other vital signs, which suggests that a drone might be able to spot potential infections from above.\" That's right, these new drones have the capability to read biometric data of citizens without their consent. In March, TFTP reported on the Orwellian police state that unfolded in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. When Chinese citizens were allowed in the streets, drones equipped with facial recognition hover overhead to make sure they are wearing masks and took their temperature, just like the aforementioned drones. Citizens were forced to download software on their phones so the state can track them and all of it was being carried out for their own \u201csafety.\u201d We accurately predicted that this madness was headed to the Land of the Free, and later that month, it was here. Naturally, the citizens of Westport were a little concerned over having their city turned into a place like China. Connecticut resident and political activist \u2014 whose been the subject of multiple articles at TFTP \u2014 helped to foster this resistance. \u201cUsing drones to surveil people will only breed mistrust, and it will only lead to people being unnecessarily harassed,\u201d Picard told TFTP. \u201cPushing back against the police state not only works, it is necessary.\u201d We couldn't agree more. Tyrants will always push for more control and the only limit to their increasing tyranny is the level at which we resist it. \u201cThe limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.\u201d ~ Frederick Douglass Sadly, the resistance in other parts of the country is not enough. As TFTP reported last month, the NYPD took to bragging about their drone program by posting videos of drones spying on citizens. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea posted a video to Twitter of some of the aerial footage over multiple locations throughout the city of New York, including Carl Schurz Park, Inwood Hill Park and Juniper Valley Park. Unfortunately, instead of calling them out, some folks took to the tweet thread to beg the commissioner to bring the drones to their neighborhood. \u201cCome to Borough Park, my neighborhood. Not the case here!\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \u201cGo to Grand concourse not the case there. Good job officers, keep on doing great things. Praying for all of you,\u201d wrote another. There were a few comments, however, who haven't yet succumbed to being controlled by tyrants, who called it what it is \u201cDystopian af.\u201d \u201cIs this a scene from Terminator?\u201d and \u201c1984 wasn\u2019t an instruction manual.\u201d This drone dystopia came to a head earlier this month when video was published of a drone hovering above citizens, instructing them to obey social distancing. \u201cThis is the Anti-COVID-19 volunteer drone task force,\u201d the drone blares over loudspeakers as people walk and bike by. \"Please maintain a social distance of at least six feet. Again, please maintain social distancing.\" Whether or not it was a government drone remains a mystery as the NYPD claimed they were not behind the drone. But the video was ominous enough to make a lasting impression. In California, cops are also spying on their citizens with similar technology. The drones came from China, on which the Free Thought Project reported in March. Just like the Chinese authorities, police in California equipped the drones with speakers to tell people what to do. Cops across the country have been acquiring these drones \u2014 which were donated from China and were grounded by the Interior Department over spying concerns in January. Yet despite these legitimate concerns, departments from coast to coast are continuing to implement them to spy on citizens. Some officials are even clearly aware that China could be using the information from these drones to spy on America, but continue their use anyway. \u201cIf these drones save one life, it is clearly worth the activity and the information that the drones are sending,\u201d Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage told MSNBC. Hopefully, the resistance that was shown in Westport continues to spread across the country as more people learn that the only tool the state has to attempt to provide a facade of safety, is taking away your freedom through the threat of force. As we've seen countless times over, this never works out for the people.",

        "title":"EXCLUSIVE: Business Owners Meet to Defy COVID Shutdown, Run Off Cops Who Try to Stop Them",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/business-owners-run-off-cops-shutdowns",
        "text":"Buffalo, NY -- As the world is quickly learning with the recent spikes in COVID-19 cases -- despite Draconian measures by tyrants across the globe -- lockdowns do not appear to be effective at curbing the spread of the virus. They are, however, according to the World Health Organization, very good at making poor people poorer and extremely effective at wiping out a large portion of the middle class. \u201cWe in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,\u201d the WHO's Special Envoy on COVID-19 said. \u201cLockdowns just have one consequence that you must never, ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer. Look what\u2019s happened to smallholder farmers all over the world. Look what\u2019s happening to poverty levels. It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition.\u201d When comparing countries and states who have implemented economically devastating and crushing lockdowns with those who didn't lockdown at all, it is nearly impossible to see a difference in spread of the virus and deaths per million. Luckily, many governments across the planet are realizing this and have taken a more rational approach to dealing with the virus like protecting the vulnerable, recommending social distancing when possible, masks, and better treatment for the virus. However, states like New York and California appear to be completely unconcerned with logic and actual science and have continued their crackdowns, despite evidence to the contrary. In New York, thousands of businesses -- many of which have been around for decades -- have been forced to shutter their doors forever thanks largely in part to government mandates. As a result, those who want to make sure their businesses don't fall like the thousands before them -- and make sure they can feed their families -- have begun taking action to resist. The Free Thought Project spoke to one of the participants of this resistance, Daniel Crane who runs the website christianpatriots.org. Over the weekend, he and roughly 100 other local business owners gathered in Orchard Park, New York to discuss how to resist the lockdowns and safely reopen without permission from the state. The gathering at a private business somehow garnered the unwanted attention of the local police, who quickly descended on the group. As Crane explained to TFTP, \"Here in New York, the governor is shutting us down again. We were holding a private meeting with business owners to discuss a plan of action with these shut downs because we can't survive doing this over and over again. The sheriff's and health department showed up to it to shut down and harass us.\" Crane said that Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Office escorted the Erie County Health Department as standard procedure into Athlete\u2019s Unleashed, a local fitness center, in an attempt harass and breakup the meeting. But these folks were not going to go down that easily. When the officers and health department officials attempted to assert their authority inside the private business, the business owners chased them away for trespassing. This epic moment was captured on video. \"This is private property,\" the gym owner was heard on video telling the cops and health department officials. \"Go get a warrant,\" he says. After attempting to assert their authority multiple times -- unsuccessfully -- the cops and health officials turned around and walked out in shame. \"What you see here are thugs for the Governor and for tyrants,\" Crane wrote on his website. \"This is your modern day Nazi Gestapo in America. The Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Department sent deputies out to violate the rights of American people who are loosing their jobs and businesses over this pandemic. The Erie County Health Department was also present. People need to remember these faces, call the Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Department and hold these unconstitutional tyrants accountable.\" Crane went on to name every official involved and put their phone number on his website. Crane tells TFTP that local business owners are planning more meetings to \"brainstorm and come up with real ways to protect one another when they all start to defy the local and state shut down orders and remain open.\" \"Businesses here can't survive under these conditions,\" he said. \"More rallies and protests are on the table as well. The hope is to be an example here in this tyrannical state for other small businesses dealing with the same date.\"",

        "title":"WATCH: Controversial COVID-19 Data Scientist\\'s Home Raided, Guns at Pointed Family, Computers Seized",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/the-state\/covid-data-scientist-home-raided",
        "text":"Tallahassee, FL \u2014 Earlier this year in May, Rebekah Jones, the data scientist working for Florida, who put together that state's COVID-19 database, made national headlines when she was fired by the state over a disagreement in reporting the numbers. Jones says she was fired for refusing to manipulate data that showed a higher number of deaths while the state claimed she was fired for insubordination. Fast-forward to this month, and what started as a firing ended with armed agents of the state allegedly pointing guns at an entire family, during a raid on their Florida home. After she was fired in May, Jones made the following claim: I was asked by DOH leadership to manually change numbers. This was a week before the reopening plan officially kicked off into phase one. I was asked to do the analysis and present the findings about which counties met the criteria for reopening. The criteria followed more or less the White House panel's recommendations, but our epidemiology team also contributed to that as well. As soon as I presented the results, they were essentially the opposite of what they had anticipated. The whole day while we're having this kind of back and forth changing this, not showing that, the plan was being printed and stapled right in front of me. So it was very clear at that point that the science behind the supposedly science-driven plan didn't matter because the plan was already made. After she was fired, Jones continued her work reporting the numbers by starting the website Florida COVID Action, which is a dashboard of Florida COVID information, like the one she used to run for the state. Since then, she's been running this site without much resistance from the state \u2014 until now. On Monday, multiple armed officers entered her home, pulled her out, before she says they began pointing guns at her children and husband. At 8:30 am this morning, state police came into my house and took all my hardware and tech. They were serving a warrant on my computer after DOH filed a complaint. They pointed a gun in my face. They pointed guns at my kids.. Jones claims that she was raided for simply reporting the data and \"speaking truth to power\" but the state says someone hacked their emergency alert system and it was traced back to Jones' IP address. In a statement, FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen confirmed hardware was seized at Jones' home, and an investigation was underway into a potential computer system hacking. \"Our investigation began last month following a complaint by Florida Department of Health that a person illegally hacked into their emergency alert system,\" the statement reads, in part. \"As part of our investigation, FDLE agents served a search warrant this morning at the Centerville Court residence where Ms. Jones lives after determining the home was the location that the unauthorized message was sent from.\" Jones has vehemently denied she had anything to do with this: \"I'm not a hacker,\" Jones said. She added that the language in the message that authorities said was sent was \"not the way I talk,\" and contained errors she would not make. \"The number of deaths that the person used wasn't even right,\" Jones said. \"They were actually under by about 430 deaths. I would never round down 430 deaths.\" Monday evening, the state released the text of the warrant and claimed that they gave Jones ample time to come out \u2014 20 minutes \u2014 but she refused. \"Agents knocked and called Ms. Jones both announcing the search warrant and encouraging her to cooperate. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents,\" the FDLE statement reads, in part. \"After several attempts, Ms. Jones allowed agents inside. Agents entered the home in accordance with normal protocols and seized several devices that will be forensically analyzed. \"At no time were weapons pointed at anyone in the home.\" Despite this claim, the video shows officers pointing guns upstairs where Jones' family was. Also, despite the state's claim that this is over an alleged hack, Jones' lawyer, Larry Walters, said \"this is retaliation for pursuing a discrimination claim against the state.\" \"It is highly unusual for your adversary in litigation to seize all of your client\u2019s confidential communications,\" Walters said. \"We are concerned that this is retaliation for pursuing a discrimination claim against the state and criticizing the Governor\u2019s COVID 19 response.\" If authorities are retaliating against Jones for criticizing the governor, this is indeed chilling. What this shows, however, is that no matter which \"side\" of the COVID-19 debate you are on, you are still subject to police officers coming onto your private property and detaining or arresting you. Regardless of how you feel about COVID-19, this notion is worrisome.",

        "title":"Multiple States Now Allow Children to Get COVID Vaccine Without Parental Consent",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/parental-consent-not-needed-covid19-vaccine",
        "text":"As TFTP reported earlier this month, a large portion of the country has decided that they do not want to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. As a result in the drop in demand, states are making moves to entice those who may be on the fence about getting that jab. We've seen states offer everything from free beers to millions in prizes to get citizens roll up their sleeves. In some states, officials have begun targeting children by allowing them to get the vaccine without their parents' consent. Before the FDA had even approved Pfizer's experimental COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12-15, San Francisco issued a health order allowing children to receive the shot without parental consent. ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-19 reads as follows: Minors under the age of 18 are showing increasing numbers of infections, and California law does not generally allow such minors to consent to receipt of the vaccine even though the State considers the vaccine to be general medical care and national pediatric groups recommend the vaccine for those 16 years of age and older. Many minors have a parent, guardian, or other person with legal authority who will consent to their receipt of the vaccine, but that is not true in all situations. It remains vital to the health of all in the community\u2014including adults who cannot or will not receive the vaccine as well as people who have been fully vaccinated (due to the ongoing possibility of breakthrough infections)\u2014that every person, including minors, who wants to receive the vaccine be given the opportunity. For those reasons, this Order does two things. First, it allows minors in the City and County of San Francisco (the \u201cCity\u201d) who are 12 years old or older to consent to receive any vaccine against COVID-19 that has been authorized by the FDA (whether authorized in an emergency use basis or fully approved) for receipt by someone who is the age of that minor. The healthcare provider administering the vaccine dose must reasonably attempt to notify a person with legal authority to consent to medical care for that minor, such as a parent or guardian, and allow that person the opportunity to object to administration of that dose. San Francisco is one of many municipalities where this is taking place. Minor consent exceptions exist in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia, as well as Washington D.C. Because the current Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J vaccines have been only authorized by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the safety and effectiveness data are still being collected. This means the current mass vaccination program is an experiment in an on-going study in which researchers may still find small effect-size side effects. It is a fact that vaccines that receive EUA are considered experimental until the FDA formally approves it as it is entirely possible that a rare side effect will be found after mass vaccination allows a longer term of observation on a larger number of people. The idea of the state circumventing parental authority and giving children an experimental shot without their parents' consent is utterly shocking. What's more Supreme Court precedent has been clearly established and has held for decades that parents have both the duty and the right to direct the care, custody, and control of their minor children. This move in San Francisco and others like it are in direct conflict with said Supreme Court precedent and contrary to the U.S. Constitution. In fact, in its 1979 Parham v. J.R. decision, the Supreme Court declared that the state cannot make these decisions: \u201cSimply because the decision of a parent is not agreeable to a child, or because it involves risks, does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state. The same characterizations can be made for a tonsillectomy, appendectomy, or other medical procedure. Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.\u201d The state taking parental rights away and allowing impressionable children to be guided by government motives is a terrifying notion. Nevertheless, it is happening. There have been 4,863 deaths reported to the CDC's VAERS system since December, some of which have been children. Medical professionals, schools, politicians, and health directors should not be permitted to coerce impressionable children into a medical procedure capable of causing injury or death behind their parents\u2019 back. This is utter insanity, yet it is becoming a matter of policy. Here at the Free Thought Project, we are not \"anti-vaxxers\" but rather advocate for informed consent and vaccine safety. Removing parental consent flies in the face of both of these and sets us on a path down a very slippery slope. If this blatant attack on parental rights isn't called out, rest assured it will spread to other states and this slippery slope could remove parental rights entirely, handing over all parental duties to the state \u2014 a terrifying though indeed.",

        "title":"WATCH: Presumed COVID-19 Patient Held Down Against His Will by Police, Given Forced Procedure",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/be-the-change\/watch-presumed-covid-19-patient-held-down-against-his-will-by-police-given-forced-procedure",
        "text":"One of the freedoms patients in America currently have is in jeopardy in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is the freedom to leave a doctor's office, hospital, or nursing home against medical advice. It's also known as \"leaving AMA\". Some patients, for example, already lost the right. They are the mentally ill. Mentally ill interred patients may wish to leave AMA but because of the nature of their illness they're not allowed to do so. But what happens when someone who is not mentally ill, who presumably has COVID-19 because of symptoms, wishes to leave a medical facility AMA? The answer may be scarier than the fear of the virus itself. With respect to AMA and COVID-19 Forbes writes: While patients may theoretically still be able to exercise their right to leave AMA, hospital systems, government officials, and community watchdogs will need to determine how to manage this conundrum if it indeed does start becoming prevalent. A video shared with TFTP \u2014 which is being systematically deleted from the internet \u2014 shows an example of this. James Abram, of Dallas, TX, went to the hospital, reportedly by ambulance, with symptoms of a chronic cough and a fever. Yet when hospital staff attempted to do a \"work up\" on him to determine which illness he had when someone from his home called for help, he refused and started a Facebook live video. After spending some time in the ER, six local hospital staff including what appeared to be police officers equipped with body cameras, surrounded him and attempted to test him by force. It's unknown if James had an extreme fear of needles, or a history of mental illness, but he did ask for a lawyer. \"Before you stick a needle in me,\" he said as his anxiousness seemed to increase, he wanted a lawyer present. One of the caregivers attempted to explain to Mr. Abram why they wanted him to consent to be tested. He explained: So the doctors talked to you. They did not feel like you have the capacity to make medical decisions based on their discussion with you. Abram attempted to question the contention by alluding to his age and the fact he's a \"grown man\" capable of making his own decisions. His request for a lawyer was simply ignored as staff continued to surround him and inch closer to restraining him and testing him by force. One staff member asked him if he were simply going to leave and go infect other citizens. No rationalization was working with Abram and no objections were being validated by the hospital staff who were intent on testing him. The staff member stated: All we're trying to do is help you. Nobody wants to hurt you. We just want to make sure that you're okay. The belief, the hospital staff were more concerned about his wellness than violating his medical rights, seems legitimate. However, we have also seen where beat cops, street level officers of the law, also use citizens' wellness concerns to force medical evaluations, tests, inoculations, and even sodomy over the objections of unsuspecting individuals. The stalemate between Abram and the hospital staff continued. So if you'd be willing for us to do what we need to do medically to you, you wouldn't have to go through all of this and I think that's the concern. You're sick. We can all tell that you're sick but you don't want to get the help that you need. You were sick enough to call an ambulance. At this point in the video, Abram starts talking about a \"Revolution\". It's unclear if his revolutionary comments are indicative of his mental well-being or his nervousness in being surrounded. \"Do you know what a revolution is?...I'm a revolutionary...Coronavirus is not real...Y'all ain't fooling me...My IQ is over a 100...\" the young man and father of one ranted before adding, \"I'm not sick.\" Abram admitted he was brought to the hospital because of a cough and that he wasn't feeling well. All the while it appears a law enforcement officer was in the room as well because a police radio was heard in the background of the video. \"Things are going to change today,\" Abram said as he promised to televise the revolution. \"The revolution will be televised bro,\" he said. It's at this point in the video Abram communicated what he wanted from medical staff and it did not include putting a needle in his arm. Arguably in his most lucid request, James Abram stated, unwaveringly, he wanted his five basic needs met. I want you to give me my five basic needs that every American should have. Those five needs are air , water, nutrients, shelter and sleep, but Abram would not have his needs met until after hospital staff had their way with him and tested him by force. The last few minutes in the video show nothing as the camera was lowered and staff moved in to administer their tests. Screams could be heard as Abram continually pleaded for it to end. Seventeen minutes into the video, the staff presumably administered the tests, over the objections of Abram, amid terrifying screams, and violence which could not be seen, only heard. Abram complained staff choked him, \"help that sh*t ain't right bro!\" \"This is not right, bro,\" he stated. The whole incident is understandably disturbing and certainly Abram's right to leave the hospital AMA was overruled. We interviewed a nurse practitioner who wanted his identity protected. He believed Abram may have a history of mental illness and pointed to strange statements he made in the video about his childhood, the revolution, and COVID-19 not being real as potential evidence. \"He's just reacting completely out of fear...you were probably scared as a kid, too, and now you could really hurt someone if you're infected with COVID-19,\" he told TFTP. It's still unclear if life for the world will return to the way it was before the latest iteration of the Coronavirus presented itself. Already the mainstream media and the government appear to be programming minds of viewers by using buzzwords such as \"our new normal\". Who knows if the Coronavirus will turn out to be the Trojan horse which takes away and defeats every American's right to resist testing and leave a medical facility against the medical advice (AMA) of the healthcare professionals. Along with our rights to privacy, the right of refusal of medical treatment appears to be threatened now more than ever before. It was not too long ago America seemed outraged at a Utah police officer's manhandling arrest of a hospital nurse who attempted to protect the rights of a comatose patient's blood not to be drawn and used against him in a court of law. That officer was fired but quietly rehired proving not even violating a person's rights to not have their blood drawn against their will is enough to keep a fired cop from being rehired. Since the incident in the hospital Abram created a fundraiser he calls the Jame's Family Fundraiser. As of the writing of this story, Abram asked for only $500 and received all of it. He says he's \"not a greedy man\" and just wants the money to help his family. In another of his videos he admits to having no health insurance through his employer and getting paid in cash and treated like an \"illegal immigrant\" by the company he works for. Certainly, as COVID-19 takes over the United States killing people, more cases of patients wanting to leave AMA will take place. How we as a society choose to respond to those individuals' requests may determine if we as a people will be able to resist the help offered to us by medical professionals. Will forced vaccinations be next? Will refusal to consent to inoculations on religious grounds be banished forever (it already is in some states)? Will families forever lose the right to informed consent? These questions and more remain as we wade through an existential life-threatening pandemic. Short video: Full video:",

        "text":"Time and again, those in positions of authority, abuse that authority by intimidating and even arresting those with whom they politically disagree. We have seen this scenario play out like a broken record against individuals expressing their legal and peaceful views on social media only to be visited by police and even kidnapped and caged. Amyiah Cohoon learned about this authoritarian practice last year when she was a sophomore in high school. Last year, she took a trip to Florida for spring break with the Westfield Area High School band. Their trip was cut short, however, as it took place in the middle of March 2020 \u2014 when governments began implementing lockdowns over COVID-19. While on the trip, Cohoon felt that she contracted the virus. Testing at this time was scant and unreliable at best so when the results for her coronavirus test came back negative, she and her doctors both felt that she was still positive. When she first felt sick, she took to her Instagram account to let her friends and family know. She told them that even though she tested negative, her doctors felt she had it. Later, she took to Instagram again to let everyone know she had beat it and was better, urging others to stay safe. It was a benign post, completely innocent in nature, and had no ill will toward anyone. Despite these factors, Marquette County Sheriff's Sgt. Cameron Klump and his boss took issue with it and on March 27, 2020, he personally visited Cohoon in her home and told her that Sheriff Joseph Konrath had ordered the posts be taken down \u2014or else. When asked why, Klump told the family that Konrath \"didn't believe there were any confirmed cases of COVID in the county.\" The school board also got on the bandwagon and alerted all the parents in town that there was \"no truth\" to the \"rumors\" that a student had contracted COVID. But there was truth to it. Nevertheless, the sheriff released a statement calling Cohoon's post \"a foolish means to get attention and the source of the rumor has been addressed.\u201d Even if Cohoon's post was a means of garnering attention, millions of other people at the same time were taking to Facebook saying the exact same thing. It was common for many folks during the beginning of the pandemic to claim they thought they had already had it back in January or earlier and it would later suggested by studies that COVID was in the US as early as December 2019. Naturally, after being intimidated and threatened with jail over her free speech, Cohoon's family sued the deputy and the sheriff over their harassment. This month, they won their lawsuit as U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig granted her summary judgment in the case. The taxpayers of Marquette County will now be held liable for the Stasi-esque tactics of their sheriff's department. \u201cThe First Amendment is not a game setting for the government to toggle off and on. It applies in times of tranquility and times of strife,\" Ludwig wrote in a 16-page decision.\"While Defendants in this case may have believed their actions served the greater good, that belief cannot insulate them. Demanding a 16-year-old remove protected speech from her Instagram account is a First Amendment violation.\u201d The rights-violating duo originally attempted to claim qualified immunity in the case but Ludwig denied the request. The attorneys representing Cohoon argued \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014 that free speech rights do not suddenly disappear during an emergency. Unfortunately, many in big tech and government disagree. Luckily for Cohoon, however, the court did not. It wasn't a total win, however. After winning the lawsuit, Cohoon's parents sought an injunction against the sheriff and deputy for clearly overstepping their authority by threatening to arrest and charge an innocent teenager for her free speech. According to the Wausau Daily Herald, however, Ludwig denied the injunction request, saying it was too broad and unnecessary in light of his order that Konrath and his deputy had violated Cohoon's free speech rights. Both the deputy and the sheriff will face no consequences for their actions.",

        "text":"Aurora, CO \u2014 Imagine for a moment that a handful of \"bad apple\" police officers attacked, choked, and forcibly drugged an innocent pillar of the community as he walked home from the store \u2014 killing him. Imagine that we are told these cops committed no crime when they attacked this innocent man and killed him. Then, imagine after cops got away with killing him, other cops went back to the scene to re-enact the killing, while taking pictures to mock his death. Imagine that people then become very upset and demand a stop to this police brutality and above the law murderous mentality. And, while these people are in the streets to demand cops stop killing innocent people, imagine they are arrested for it and face insanely long prison sentences as a result \u2014 as the killer cops walk free. There is no need to imagine this, because it is exactly what happened in Aurora, Colorado. Several protesters \u2014 who never harmed anyone, destroyed no property, and advocated no violence \u2014 are staring down the possibility of decades in prison for protesting the lack of charges for the cops who killed Elijah McClain as well as the other cops who mocked his death. Though hundreds of people have been arrested for their role in protests, Joel Northam, 33, and Lillian House, 26, are seeing the extreme end of these arrests. \"I'm facing as many as 48 years in prison,\" said House, an organizer in Denver and one of the six activists arrested and charged in September of last year. According to arrest documents, they were arrested in connection with crimes committed during June and July protests in Aurora \u2013 protests House and Northam contend were peaceful, 9 News reported. \"In this country, we're supposed to have the right to protest peacefully,\" House said in late December, four months after she and Northam were arrested. \"Yet now, we're facing some very serious retaliation and may be looking at decades in prison for fighting for justice in our community.\" They are being charged with kidnapping an entire police department because they protested at the police station and demanded two more officers involved in Elijah McClain's death be fired. They caused no damage and never physically touched anyone. \"We've done nothing wrong. We have committed no crimes, and we are not the violent ones here,\" Northam said. Since there were 18 police officers inside the department at the time of the protest, Adams County district attorney's office alleges those charged with kidnapping \"attempted to imprison\" 18 officers \u2014 an outright laughable claim \u2014 but a claim that threatens to put these folks away for what could be the rest of their lives. \"We completely reject the characterization of what we've been doing as violent or dangerous. Or in any way anything other than a positive movement towards the betterment of our community,\" said House. House and Northam say these charges are an attempt to make an example out of them to scare others into silence. \"What really is at issue here,\" House said, \"is these forces do not want this protest movement to continue.\" \"This is not just an attack on us as organizers and the organization,\" Northam said. \"This is an attack on a mass movement of thousands of people, of families, of community members.\" \"Of course we value our freedom, and we don't want to spend decades in prison. But really this is an attack on the fundamental rights which allow any person to protest, any person to speak out,\" House said.It's going to be a very long and costly battle ahead of us, but that is not going to be enough to make us tuck our tail between our legs and give up our rights to fight for our community.\" As TFTP reported, last year, Elijah McClain was killed by police after he was put in a chokehold and given the sedative ketamine. The incident began when someone in the neighborhood called the police because McClain was walking down the street with groceries while wearing a mask. McClain reportedly always wore the mask because he was anemic , and often got cold, and he was an introvert. At the time of his death, he had never gotten so much as a speeding ticket in his life. In his last few words on this planet, McClain could be heard saying, \"I'm an introvert. I'm just different. That's all. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat meat! But I don't judge people, I don't judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me ... I'm so sorry.\" He was innocent, successful, and a light in this often dark world, and police killed him for being different. Then, after they killed him, they went back to the scene of the crime and reenacted it for fun. This is not some case of a bad apple. This is systemic and sadistic, and it needs to change. Here's how we can do that, right now. If you would like to sign a petition to push for the charges to be dropped against these protesters, you can do so here.",

        "text":"Ulster County, NY \u2014 Shana Shaw, 26, is a nurse assistant working the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. She was on her way home from work last week when a cop who is already being sued for wrongfully detaining another woman, decided he was going to pull her over, accusing her of failing to use a blinker while cutting him off. Minutes later, Shaw would be in handcuffs, facing multiple charges. The incident unfolded on December 28 around 3:45 as Shaw drove home from work. Deputy Brian Woltman accused her of cutting him off, so he used his police powers to pull her over. While pulling the woman over, Woltman ran Shaw's license plate and found that her license was suspended. After she pulled over and complied with the deputy, Shaw asks him why she is being pulled over. The deputy responds: \u201cyou cut me off without signaling back there on 9W,\u201d and \u201cyour license is suspended.\u201d Shaw denied that she failed to signal and said that she had already taken care of her suspended license and that her paperwork was at home. \"That stinks,\" said Woltman. Woltman then tells Shaw to \"hop out\" of her car and Shaw again immediately complies. When she asks why she is being asked to get out of the car, Woltman tells the woman \u2014 who hasn't harmed anyone \u2014 that she is being placed under arrest for driving on a suspended license. Naturally, Shaw then became uneasy when she realized she was about to be kidnapped for something she says she already took care of. \u201cLet\u2019s not make things difficult,\u201d says Woltman.\u201cLet\u2019s make this very easy.\u201d \u201cI can prove that I have everything cleared, though,\u201d Shaw says as she pleads with the deputy to follow her home so she can prove to him that she had already taken care of the suspended license. But he wants nothing to do with it. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not following you home,\u201d says Woltman. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to arrest me after I just left work, and I\u2019m a nurse?\u201d says Shaw, who told Hudson Valley One she is a nurse assistant. Shaw, who was sure that she had already take care of the suspended license then gets back in her car and says she would like to wait for a lawyer. At this point, the deputy began to escalate force and attempted to drag Shaw from her car. \u201cWhy are you grabbing me like that?\u201d Shaw asks. Woltman then calls for backup as he pulls the woman's arm and when another officer arrives, Shaw is thrown to the ground where she says she hit her head and received a concussion. \u201cI feel fully taken advantage of,\u201d Shaw told Hudson Valey One. \u201cI don\u2019t think there needed to be two male officers to yoke up a girl that is 130 pounds, in her scrubs from work, and I\u2019m an essential worker.\u201d She said she was disturbed by Woltman's apparent familiarity with her even though she didn\u2019t know him and was worried that the encounter could turn deadly. \u201cHe knew who I was already. He proceeded to say step out of the car. In my head I don\u2019t have enough information and he knows who I am so I felt uncomfortable\u2026I am an African-American and cops are shooting us in the head and killing us,\u201d Shaw added. After the incident, Shaw retained an attorney who announced in a press release that they would be suing the officer for excessive force. \u201cDeputy Sheriff Brian Woltman Jr. used excessive force that resulted in Ms. Shaw getting a concussion, nerve damage in her wrist from the handcuffs, bruises on her body, putting her out of work for days,\u201d the press release said. \u201cEven if I broke a law, that was still excessive force,\u201d Shaw said. Shaw would later find that her fears were justified about Woltman. Hudson Valley One reported that he has an alleged history of false detention of women. Woltman has been previously accused of false detention and excessive force against another woman who is also suing Woltman and Ulster County. Shaw plans on joining that suit.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/child-arrested-selling-candy",
        "text":"New York, NY \u2014 New York State is one of the hardest his places on the planet right now in regard to COVID-19. In New York City alone, nearly 7,000 people have died as of Monday morning from the virus. Instead of patrolling the streets and helping folks, however, a video that surfaced over the weekend, appears to show NYC's finest concerned with a small child \u2014 for selling chips and candy on the subway. As families struggle to survive with unemployment at record highs, many folks are doing everything they can to earn enough money to simply put food on their tables. It appears that a child around 10 years of age was doing exactly that this weekend by selling chips and candy on the subway before NYPD officers swarmed in and kidnapped him. A video taken on Friday in a Harlem subway station shows multiple NYPD officers in face masks forcibly dragging a small child away from a woman claiming to be his mother. The child was alleged to have been selling candy and bags of chips on the train \u2014 apparently a grave criminal offense in Harlem. A witness and a person who filmed the chaotic and infuriating scene, Shaquan Jenkins told the Gothamist he was on his way home when he watched in awe as cops surrounded a child and physically seized him for selling candy. Jenkins said he had seen the boy moving through the subway car selling candy shortly before police officers grabbed him. He says a woman who identified herself as the boy's mother repeatedly told police \"that's my son.\" One video shared by Jenkins on Twitter showed the distraught boy struggling with police officers as subway riders angrily object. As the video shows, the woman is pleading with officers not to take her son \u2014 a scene Jenkins described as kidnappers stealing a child. \"We're gonna let your son go when you speak to me,\" one officer tells the woman. \"I'm speaking to you now!\" the woman replies. \"You're not speaking to me,\" the officer says to the woman. According to Jenkins, the police had no reason to arrest the child as he had the full support of everyone on the subway. Bystanders even tried to save the child's bag of candy and chips, but Jenkins said the cops threw it in the trash. \"They looked like kidnappers, like they were trying to kidnap the little boy,\" Jenkins said. \"I felt outraged. It\u2019s a little boy. Can\u2019t they talk to him on his level and say it\u2019s not safe, go home? Why did they need three officers to take him to the precinct?\" Video from another witness shows more cops storm the train station, and at one point, the candy and chips-selling child is surrounded by nearly a dozen cops as he is dragged up the stairs and out of the subway station. According to the Gothamist, the NYPD Transit Police maintains a precinct in the station, and Jenkins says he followed the officers as they brought the boy there. It's unclear if the boy was further detained in the precinct. The NYPD did not immediately respond to inquiries about the incident. \u201cThe video is upsetting and we have reached out to the NYPD for more information,\" said MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan in a statement. As TFTP reported last month, the NYPD has claimed to slow arrests in order to decrease the prison population which is a ticking time bomb with concern to COVID-19. However, as this video shows, they clearly couldn't care less about breaking social distancing guidelines, endangering the public, and exposing a small child to disease in order to stop him from selling candy on a subway. Shameful indeed.",

        "title":"Ohio Sets Major Precedent, Sues Big Pharma for Deliberately \\'Fueling Opioid Epidemic\\'",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/war-on-drugs-be-the-change\/ohio-sues-manufacturers-causing-opioid-crisis",
        "text":"Five goliath pharmaceutical companies have been served with a lawsuit from the State of Ohio for their role in the opioid epidemic, because, as state Attorney General Mike DeWine alleges, they \u201chelped unleash a health care crisis that has had far-reaching financial, social, and deadly consequences in the State of Ohio.\u201d Ohio now joins a number of states in attempting to hold Big Pharma responsible for fueling the crisis of oft-ruinous addiction to legally prescribed opioid medications and their deemed illegal brethren, such as heroin. Purdue Pharma, Endo Health Solutions, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and its subsidiary, Cephalon, Johnson & Johnson and subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Allergan have all been named in the lawsuit. \u201cThis lawsuit is about justice, it's about fairness, it's about what is right,\u201d DeWine opined in an announcement from southern Ohio\u2019s Ross County \u2014 an area crushed by the epidemic in fatalities from overdoses to legal painkillers and illegal heroin \u2014 as quoted by Southwestern Ohio NBC affiliate, WLWT. \u201cThese drug companies knew that what they were saying was wrong and they did it anyway and they continue to do so.\u201d Figures for 2016, which have yet to be released, are expected to handily top the distressing 3,050 fatal overdoses Ohio experienced in 2015 \u2014 figures wholly unacceptable to DeWine, and cogent of the nation\u2019s struggle to rein in rampant over-prescribing and other facets of the opioid scourge. NPRreports the lawsuit \u201caccuses the companies of engaging in a sustained marketing campaign to downplay the addiction risks of the prescription opioid drugs they sell and to exaggerate the benefits of their use for health problems such as chronic pain.\u201d \u201cWe believe the evidence will also show that these companies got thousands and thousands of Ohioans \u2014 our friends, our family members, our co-workers, our kids \u2014 addicted to opioid pain medications, which has all too often led to use of the cheaper alternatives of heroin and synthetic opioids,\u201d the Ohio attorney general asserted in a press release excoriating the five pharmaceutical companies Wednesday. \u201cThese drug manufacturers led prescribers to believe that opioids were not addictive, that addiction was an easy thing to overcome, or that addiction could actually be treated by taking even more opioids. \u201cThey knew they were wrong, but they did it anyway \u2014 and they continue to do it. Despite all evidence to the contrary about the addictive nature of these pain medications, they are doing precious little to take responsibility for their actions and to tell the public the truth.\u201d Explicitly, DeWine notes, the lawsuit contends the medications at the core of the epidemic include OxyContin, MS Contin, Dilaudid, Butrans, Hysingla, and Targiniq from Purdue; Endo\u2019s Percocet, Percodan, Opana, and Zydone; Actiq and Fentora made by Teva and Cephalon; Johnson & Johnson and Janssen\u2019s Duragesic and Nucynta; and Kadian, Norco, and several generic opioids manufactured by Allergan. DeWine told NPR\u2019s All Things Considered the companies purposely deceived physicians and medical practitioners on the perils of the opioid medications \u2014 purely to rake in profits \u2014 to the horrific detriment of thousands of families whose loved ones became addicted or lost their lives. \u201cWe believe that the evidence will show that these pharmaceutical companies purposely misled doctors about the dangers connected with pain meds that they produced, and that they did so for the purpose of increasing sales,\u201d he asserted. \u201cAnd boy, did they increase sales.\u201d \u201cMy daughter's been gone over a year and it still doesn't seem real,\u201d Ohio father Roger Winemiller, whose daughter and son died within nine months of each other \u2014 both from overdoses on heroin \u2014 toldWLWT. Echoing one of the most common paths to illegal heroin, Winemiller described the lost battle with addiction his daughter faced, recalling that, to treat anxiety, she \u201cstarted using pills and tried stuff that the doctor prescribed but it just didn't work, then went to pills on the street then graduated to heroin.\u201d Included in the state\u2019s lawsuit is an injunction demanding the companies cease deceptive practices \u2014 inflation of benefit and deflation of risks \u2014 surrounding opioid prescriptions. Rather than pegging doctors equally responsible the opioid plague, DeWine told NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel the weight of blame lies with the mendacious practices consciously undertaken by the five Big Pharma giants and their subsidiaries. \u201cThis was not something that the pharmaceutical companies just woke up some day and just started to do a little bit of it,\u201d the attorney general explained. \u201cI mean, there was a concerted effort for an extended number of years to really pound this into the heads of doctors. And when you're told something time and time and time again and there's a lot of advertising that is being spent, yeah, it takes a while to turn that around.\u201d Naturally, Big Pharma pushed back against the lawsuit \u2014 a spokeswoman for Janssen castigated the premise as \u201clegally and factually unfounded.\u201d \u201cJanssen has acted appropriately, responsibly and in the best interests of patients regarding our opioid pain medications,\u201d Jessica Castles Smith told the Cleveland Plain Dealer by email, \u201cwhich are FDA-approved and carry FDA-mandated warnings about the known risks of the medications on every product label.\u201d Purdue, however, appeared to capitulate somewhat \u2014 agreeing the epidemic must be addressed. \u201cOxyContin accounts for less than 2 percent of the opioid analgesic prescription market nationally,\u201d the company told the Plain Dealer, \u201cbut we are an industry leader in the development of abuse-deterrent technology, advocating for the use of prescription drug monitoring programs and supporting access to Naloxone \u2014 all important components for combating the opioid crisis.\u201d NPR noted the state estimates more than 200,000 Ohioans currently battle addiction to opioids. DeWine elaborated further, telling the Plain Dealer 80 percent of heroin addicts first were prescribed legal opioid medications \u2014 and that, although this particular lawsuit aims to hold manufacturers accountable, he refused to rule out future litigation against distributors. Opioids continue to be doled out with alarming regularity for both acute and chronic pain, while viable alternatives to both treat pain and reduce opioid dependency \u2014 such as cannabis and kratom \u2014 remain unattainable thanks to the Federal Government\u2019s laughable war on drugs. In the meantime, a growing number of states and localities \u2014 including Everett, Washington, and the states of West Virginia, Mississippi, and Kentucky \u2014 as well as the Cherokee Nation, have employed legal means to call Big Pharma to task for recklessly allowing the opioid crisis to fester unhindered. \u201cIt's not the whole cause, but it's a big part of the cause,\u201d Winemiller said of the targets of the lawsuit. \u201cI mean, there's many, many people that's gone to pain clinics, had surgeries or whatever, and they take this medication and they get hooked on it, and then they get cut off and so they go the cheaper route and end up with the heroin.\u201d He added, \u201cI've lost two [children]. It's just like a bad dream that won't quit.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/filming-cops\/lapd-cops-water-guns",
        "text":"Los Angeles, CA \u2014 A video that will surely be a controversial conversation starter was shared with the Free Thought Project this week showing LAPD officers getting doused with water in a Los Angeles neighborhood. According to the OP, the officers were in the neighborhood to enforce social distancing. It is clear in the video that none of the residents of the Los Angeles neighborhood who were outside were concerned with social distancing. \"Six feet! Six feet!\" a person is heard yelling when the cops exited the vehicle. All of the sudden, as the male officer rounded the front of his cruiser, a young man runs up with a water gun and starts spraying. He was clearly not afraid of how the officer would react and seemed to be doing it as a joke. The first person spraying would then set off a chain reaction of other people joining in and spraying the officers. Eventually, they were hit with so much water that they had to retreat. As the two officers got in their vehicle, a torrent of water was unleashed on their cruiser with one person throwing a water gun as the pair drove off. Below is that video. With a population of nearly 4 million residents, Los Angeles is the largest city in California and the country's second most populous city after New York City. It is clear from this video that a significant portion of the city is not practicing social distancing. Despite this obvious lack of social distancing, California is not even ranked in the top 30 states per 100,000 people for coronavirus deaths. Something to think about. As TFTP has reported, this is not the first time citizens have been caught on video dousing cops with water. Last year, this became a trend. Multiple videos of people dumping water on cops took the internet by storm in 2019 with some police supporters calling for the offenders to be killed. Despite not doing anything at the time, in July, police began arresting the people seen in the videos for dumping water on the officers. According to police, one of the men in a now-viral video seen dumping water on officers was 24-year-old Robert Perez. In July, Perez was arrested in connection with the drenching of two police officers by a crowd with buckets of water in the Bronx. The incident on East 173rd Street and Boston Road in the Bronx was captured on cellphone video, according to NBC New York. Perez was charged with harassment, criminal mischief, disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. After his arrest, police released images of 10 more people wanted in connection with the water incident. The images led to the arrest of three more people, Courtney Thompson, Isiah Scott and Chad Bowden, all 28, and all face charges similar to Perez. The video of the officers getting drenched by a crowd of people sent shock waves through the media. Because water can't really hurt someone, the debate over what should happen to people who dump it on cops raged. Then, as TFTP reported at the time, we saw how the police felt about it when they began making arrests. Exactly how the LAPD will respond to the people spraying water in this video remains a mystery. However, if they respond to water guns like they respond to innocent people sitting in a field, the residents of this neighborhood should be on the lookout.",

        "text":"Salt Lake City, UT -- Since the United States began locking down and issuing stay at home orders, police interactions have become less frequent but more bizarre. Over the past two weeks, TFTP has reported on everything from cops coughing on people to violating their own social distancing orders to arrest innocent dads playing t-ball with their children. In a video out of Salt Lake City this weekend, the police state insanity during the coronavirus lockdown has progressed even further. A Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s deputy is seen getting in an innocent man's face and telling the man that he is above the social distancing order. The incident is now under investigation by the Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s office after a video of it posted to Instagram went viral. The video was posted by user View this post on Instagram Let me make this perfectly clear, we were in no way trespassing. We were just snowboarding. This officer (badge number 52-\u201cdelta\u201d) was completely out of line. By conducting yourself in this manner you make everyone in your department and every officer that wears that badge of honor an absolute disgrace. You should be ashamed to call yourself an officer of the law. When you lie about laws you\u2019re sworn to uphold, you\u2019ve not only lost yourself but every piece of dignity that deserves any bit of respect from your fellow officers.

We were just snowboarding. This officer (badge number 52-\u201cdelta\u201d) was completely out of line. By conducting yourself in this manner you make everyone in your department and every officer that wears that badge of honor an absolute disgrace. You should be ashamed to call yourself an officer of the law. When you lie about laws you\u2019re sworn to uphold, you\u2019ve not only lost yourself but every piece of dignity that deserves any bit of respect from your fellow officers. I am appalled by your actions and I hope you take a good long hard look in the mirror and figure out exactly what the hell you\u2019re doing. One thing you are NOT DOING is your job!!!!!! I won\u2019t even get into the blatant disregard for public health. I\u2019ll let the public comment on that.. #serveandprotectnotharassandabuse While we do not know what led up to the video, what is going on in the video is perfectly clear -- above the law harassment and unprofessional behavior. As the video begins, a cop is screaming in the face of a man, for apparently no reason. The officer seems upset at the man's attitude. \"How far do you think I\u2019m going to tolerate your attitude?\u201d the officer asks. The police officer also says \u201ctrespassing is trespassing\u201d to the man, and later says he is doing the man the benefit of \u201ctrying to get permission from somebody.\u201d As the cop continues to get in the man's face, the snowboarder asks the cop to please back up. That's when the cop -- who does not have on a face mask -- makes the assertion that he doesn't need to abide by social distancing. \u201cI do not need to give you a social distance!\u201d the cop states. The tyrant cop then claims that the man \u201cinvited this\u201d on himself, before telling the man to \u201cshut your f**king mouth.\u201d As the bystander films the incident, the male officer's female partner attempts to stop it. She tells the person filming to stop it, but is quickly told by the person filming that it is their right to film. Knowing that the person filming was correct, the female officer said, \"Okay,\" and turned back around. The video then ends as the screaming cops storms off behind a van. The department was forced to respond to the video after it went viral. In a statement to KSL, Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera said: \u201cWe are aware of the video and are investigating the incident. We do not condone this type of language from our officers.\u201d KSL also interviewed the man who posted the video to Instagram, Ryan Flaska, who told them that in spite of the cop's display of aggression, no arrests were made and no tickets were given. It was all for nothing. \"There is a lot that can be debated in this video, what led up to these actions or what was said before the video started,\" Flaska said in an Instagram message. \"The officer\u2019s actions clearly put this person at risk.\" As KSL reports: He said the group was concerned that the officer did not comply with social distancing recommendations in the midst of the pandemic. They were being respectful to the officer, he added. No one called to complain about the group, and there were not any \"no trespassing\" signs posted in the area, according to Flaska. Below is a video showing how perceived authority can be a risk, not only to the tyrant cops who ignore social distancing, but to innocent bystanders who become of victim of said authority.",

        "title":"As COVID PPE Waste Litters the World, Company Makes Biodegradable Hemp Masks",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/the-state\/ppe-litter-worldwide-problem-hemp",
        "text":"Despite all evidence pointing to fishing nets as the main culprit behind plastics in the ocean, in 2019, California became the first state to ban drinking straws. Those who violate this insane dictate are now \"guilty of a misdemeanor with each offense punishable by a fine of not less than $25 or more than $1,000, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding 6 months, or by both.\" Now, many Californians don't have to worry about those pesky plastic straws because thanks to the state's extreme lockdown measures, 1 in every 3 California restaurants who give out those straws will be permanently closing. However, Californians have a new problem, bigger than than the straw problem ever was: PPE. Over the weekend, during I Love a Clean San Diego\u2019s Coastal Cleanup Day, volunteers were surprised to learn that personal protective equipment was making up a significant portion of the trash on the beaches. According to a report in Courthouse News, during the group\u2019s annual \u201cCreek to Bay\u201d cleanup, which was postponed several months and held in June due to the pandemic, the organization\u2019s marketing manager Ian Monahan said volunteers \u201csaw PPE in spades,\u201d collecting 30 masks within the first half hour of the event from gutters, the boardwalk and tangled in coastal sage scrub. \u201cPPE was the most remarkable change in our clean-up efforts,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cTypically it was plastic bags, but now it\u2019s masks.\u201d Despite several cities in California passing laws which fine citizens for littering PPE \u2014 as if littering wasn't already illegal \u2014 it has failed to prevent the litter, just like the straw ban. While many folks think that the blue and white disposable masks are made from paper or cloth, they are actually made out of plastics like polypropylene, which, when thrown in the ocean, break down and become microplastics. \u201cIt makes its way through the sewer system which ultimately flows through the ocean, and once in the system, they break down into microplastics. Plastic never goes away \u2014 it breaks down to the molecular level and infects the food system and marine life,\u201d Monahan said. Sadly, it's not just California who is seeing this problem either. It is everywhere, in every state and every country. It is estimated that over 200 billion masks and gloves are being discarded every single month across the planet with a shocking number of them ending up in waterways. Even states like Texas, we are seeing similar problems. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re seeing a significant uptick in the amount of PPE litter. Not only is it unsightly, it is also harmful to the environment and a danger to public health,\u201d said Becky Ozuna, program administrator for the Don\u2019t mess with Texas campaign. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with your masks, gloves and wipes, do the right thing and dispose of them properly. This simple action helps keep Texas clean and safe.\u201d In France, Joffrey Peltier, founder of the French non-profit Op\u00e9ration Mer Propre, warned about PPE becoming a new pollution problem back in June. \u201cIt\u2019s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,\u201d said Peltier, according to the Guardian. Sadly, it appears that nothing is really being done. Littering is already illegal, and making PPE litter 'extra illegal' is showing to have very little effect. Despite Peltier's warning, France ordered billions more disposable masks. In fact, government's around the planet appear the largest purchasers of disposable PPE which adds to the problem. In Italy, during its lifting of lockdown phase, officials began ordering 1 billion masks and half a billion gloves per month, according to estimates from the Polytechnic of Turin. According to a WWF report, \"if just 1% of the masks were disposed of incorrectly and dispersed in nature, this would result in as many as 10 million masks per month polluting the environment.\" \"Considering that the weight of each mask is about 4 grams, this would result in the dispersion of more than 40 thousand kilograms of plastic in nature,\" the report stipulated. While it is certainly understandable to amass large supplies of N95 masks for first responders, mass purchases of other disposable masks don't make sense. Nevertheless, California governor Gavin Newsom acted similarly and inked a billion dollar deal in April and has been purchasing 200 million disposable masks a month since. And it is apparently having a significant impact. \u201cAnecdotally there\u2019s a lot of [PPE] out there, local coordinators throughout state are reporting large upticks of trash on shorelines and PPE in the environment,\u201d Coastal Commission Marine Debris Program Manager Eben Schwartz told Courthouse News., noting the commission asked volunteers to log their trash collected, including PPE, through the Clean Swell app. Another side effect of government lockdowns raining down hell on the environment is to-go food containers. Because many states forced restaurants to close except for to-go orders or outdoor dining, there was a massive uptick in the use of disposable food containers. Lynn Adams of the Pacific Beach Coalition in San Francisco said PPE coupled with food container trash is a massive problem. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much trash, public works can\u2019t keep up with emptying the trash cans,\u201d Adams said. Since many governments have legislated stricter penalties for PPE litter \u2014 and the problem has not subsided \u2014 it appears that we cannot legislate our way out of this problem. There are solutions\u2014outside of the police state. However, thanks to government regulations they are severely behind schedule. Hemp, one of the most useful plants on the planet, has thousands of applications, including making plastic that is biodegradable and non-toxic. Imagine a mask that would turn back to earth even if some asshole littered it. Well, you no longer have to imagine it because thanks to the free market, they now exist. As Reuters reports, the French hemp company Geochanvre pitches the hemp masks as a way to reduce plastic waste during the coronavirus pandemic from single-use protective gear that environmentalists say will take centuries to decompose and is polluting the oceans. Sadly, companies like Geochanvre, who are making the hemp masks are in short supply thanks to a century of ignorance. Had this infrastructure not been hindered by government over the last century, this article wouldn't even be necessary.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/government-corruption\/new-york-city-sues-big-pharma-for-deliberately-fueling-opioid-epidemic",
        "text":"New York City has become the latest city to hold Big Pharma accountable for the role it has played in the Opioid Epidemic. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city has filed a $500 million lawsuit against eight major drug companies that distribute prescription opioids because it is \"time for Big Pharma to pay for what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s time that they are held accountable.\u201d The companies named in the lawsuit include manufacturers Allergan Plc, Endo International Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. In a statement, de Blasio noted that he feels the lawsuit is necessary because deaths from opioid overdoses have reached unbearable heights in recent years, and now occur more often than deaths from car crashes and homicides\u2014combined. \u201cMore New Yorkers have died from opioid overdoses than car crashes and homicides combined in recent years. Big Pharma helped to fuel this epidemic by deceptively peddling these dangerous drugs and hooking millions of Americans in exchange for profit. It\u2019s time for hold the companies accountable for what they\u2019ve done to our City, and help save more lives.\u201d The lawsuit is accusing manufacturers of misleading consumers and hiding the dangers of highly addictive prescription opioids, and it is accusing distributors of oversupplying the drugs, ignoring suspicious orders, and helping illegal suppliers. As Reuters reported, more than 42,000 Americans died from opioid-induced overdoses in 2016, and more than 1,100 of those deaths occurred in New York City. In statements responding to The Hill\u2019s request for comment on the lawsuit, Endo and Purdue Pharma denied the allegations, Janssen Pharmaceuticals called the claims \u201cbaseless and unsubstantiated,\u201d AmerisourceBergen said it has been working closely with the DEA, and Allergan insisted that its products containing opioids were only responsible for 0.08% of the overdose deaths in 2016. \"Teva is committed to the appropriate use of opioid medicines, and we recognize the critical public health issues impacting communities across the U.S. as a result of illegal drug use as well as the misuse and abuse of opioids that are available legally by prescription,\u201d the company responded. New York City joins more than 10 others who have filed lawsuits against Big Pharma, which started when the city of Chicago took legal action in 2014. Other major cities that have filed lawsuits include Seattle, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati. City Lab reported that the current lawsuits are hoping for a victory similar to one that occurred when attorneys from 46 states sued the tobacco industry in 1998: \u201cDrug companies marketed and sold too many prescription drugs to too many patients, they argue, without offering adequate and accurate information about their risks. As a result, thousands of users have become dependent, often turning to harder versions of those originally prescribed opioids. The cities developing the lawsuits listed below are bolstering the state effort in holding Big Pharma accountable, much in the way that 46 state and local attorneys worked together to take on Big Tobacco in 1998. Then, their efforts were successful: tobacco companies ended up paying out more than $200 billion in settlements for peddling addictive, harmful drugs. The opioid industry could be next.\u201d Five of the major pharmaceutical companies named in New York\u2019s lawsuit were also named in a lawsuit filed by the state of Ohio in June 2017. As The Free Thought Project reported, state Attorney General Mike DeWine alleged that the companies \u201chelped unleash a health care crisis that has had far-reaching financial, social, and deadly consequences in the State of Ohio.\u201d \u201cThis lawsuit is about justice, it\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about what is right. These drug companies knew that what they were saying was wrong and they did it anyway and they continue to do so,\u201d DeWine said in a statement.",

        "title":"Veterans Put On Skull Masks, March to Expose Epidemic of VA Abuse and Veteran Suicide",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/be-the-change\/veterans-put-on-skull-masks-march-to-expose-epidemic-of-va-abuse-and-veteran-suicide",
        "text":"New Orleans, LA \u2014 Veterans from all over the United States gathered in front of the New Orleans VA hospital Sunday morning for a march to raise awareness for the epidemic of veteran suicides currently gripping the nation. It is no secret that the leading cause of death among active duty troops deployed to the Middle East is not combat or accidents, or IEDs \u2014 it's themselves. The Pentagon's own statistics show that this is a crisis but it is being ignored. In 2016, the Pentagon examined the numbers, noting that a total of 55 US troops, in both hostile and non-hostile situations, lost their lives in foreign occupations. The number of soldiers who killed themselves was nearly 5 times that amount. Not only are active duty soldiers tragically ending their own lives at an increasing rate, but once they finish their service, these numbers skyrocket. While the suicide rate for active duty members is certainly shocking, veterans kill themselves at a rate nearly 200 percent more. The most recent data shows that a veteran kills himself or herself in the United States about every 65 minutes. That is 8,000 veterans a year. If we look at attempted suicides, that number skyrockets once more to 19,000 attempts, of which 8,000 result in ending their own lives. One of these attempted suicides was Air Force veteran John Michael Watts, 58, who approached the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta around 10:45 a.m. on Tuesday and within minutes, he was engulfed in flames that burned 90 percent of his body. Watts set himself on fire in an attempted suicide to raise awareness to the problems within the VA. \u201cThese findings are deeply concerning, which is why I made suicide prevention my top clinical priority,\u201d said VA Secretary Dr. David J. Shulkin last year. \u201cI am committed to reducing Veteran suicides through support and education. We know that of the 20 suicides a day that we reported last year, 14 are not under VA care. This is a national public health issue that requires a concerted, national approach.\u201d Indeed, this problem is concerning, but the VA is not posing any real solutions, which is why this group of veterans came together on Sunday, put on skull masks to humanize the dead, and marched to the 2018 Libertarian Convention. The \"March of the Dead\" was an event organized by activist and veteran of the USMC, Adam Kokesh. \"I\u2019ve had a few friends and a number of vets I\u2019ve known commit suicide. I\u2019ve dealt with PTSD myself and turned down a big bag of pharmaceuticals from the VA,\" Kokesh told News2Share as the reason for organizing the march. \"But for me, the motivation is all the guys I see struggling who I know would be better off with freedom to seek treatment without the drug war in the way. Twenty veterans will commit suicide today. How many wouldn\u2019t with proper treatment?\" The march began at the VA hospital where, ironically, police quickly blocked all the veterans from being on the property. The veterans then formed up and marched to the libertarian convention\u2014not as a protest\ufffd\ufffdbut to show support for the only party willing to apply solutions that will address this problem. Upon reaching the convention, the group of veterans, of which TFTP's Matt Agorist was a part of, presented a folded flag to the chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, Nicholas Sarwark. The flag was signed by all the veterans who participated in the protest \"As many of you in this room know, but not a lot of people in the country know,\" Sarwark said. \"The Libertarian party is the only party committed to the solutions that will get to the root causes of the veteran suicide in this country: namely increased opioid addiction, not sending our men and women off to fight in other countries' civil wars, and generally promoting a policy of peace.\" Because Agorist participated in the March as a veteran, TFTP's footage of the march is limited, however, Ford Fischer with News2Share made the powerful video below summing up the march. War is the plight of mankind. It is perpetually waged by cowards too afraid to send themselves or their own children into harm's way, but who do not hesitate to send the poor or 'patriotic.' When the state is done with its pawns of empire, it disposes of them like spent military gear. They then become unable to get the proper care they need for illness and injury related to their service. If they try to self-medicate to cope with the subsequent PTSD from being forced to brutally occupy a foreign country, these veterans have their children taken, face life in prison, or worse. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that nearly 50,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Another 140,000 are currently in jail, many of them for victimless crimes like drug possession for trying to treat their illness without pharmaceuticals. As if the numbers aren't bad enough, veterans are often the target of unjust attention from law enforcement. On multiple occasions, the Department of Homeland Security has referred to veterans as potential terrorists and noted that they pose a threat to national security. The Free Thought Project has reported on case after case of veterans returning home only to be beaten and locked up for speaking out, or killed by police during a PTSD-triggered episode. Lip service of 'supporting the troops' is proving to be the worst possible thing for them. If you really want to \"support the troops\" you'll stop supporting wars of aggression in distant lands in which Americans are forced to kill people who pose no threat to the US. If you really \"support the troops\" you'll stop blindly standing up for your government whose proven track record shows that they do everything but support the troops. It's time for Congress to act on behalf of all veterans and Americans to legalize marijuana across the nation, end foreign wars of aggression, and reboot the VA. Too many people are in jail and are being charged with felonies for a plant\u2014one that has demonstrated the power to treat the pain and depression of war, addictions to the opioids dished out by the VA, and most importantly\u2014to prevent suicide.",

        "text":"There\u2019s one thing that appears to be saving more lives during the opioid epidemic than anything else \u2013 medical cannabis. While government touts meaningless attempts at addressing the problem \u2013 paying lip service to the people while protecting Big Pharma\u2019s profits and filling jails \u2013 people are saving themselves by turning to an ancient plant. Yet another scientific study has confirmed that medical cannabis access reduces harm from opioid abuse among the population. A recent study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependency journal found that states with legal medical cannabis experience fewer hospitalizations related to opioids. \u201cMedical marijuana legalization was associated with 23% and 13% reductions in hospitalizations related to opioid dependence or abuse and [opioid pain reliever] OPR overdose, respectively; lagged effects were observed after policy implementation.\u201d Researchers from the University of California analyzed hospital administrative records for the period of 1997 to 2014. The author reported: \u201cThis study demonstrated significant reductions on OPR- (opioid pain reliever) related hospitalizations associated with the implementation of medical marijuana policies. ... We found reductions in OPR-related hospitalizations immediately after the year of policy implementation as well as delayed reductions in the third post-policy year.\" The data also show that cannabis-related hospitalizations did not increase after legalization, contrary to what prohibitionists would have you believe. \u201cWhile the interpretation of the results should remain cautious, this study suggested that medical marijuana policies were not associated with marijuana-related hospitalizations. Instead, the policies were unintendedly associated with substantial reductions in OPR related hospitalizations.\" This study is just the latest in a series of scientific inquiries on the effects of medical cannabis policy on the raging opioid epidemic, spurred by Big Pharma companies such as Purdue Pharma which knowingly deceived doctors and patients while turning a blind eye to black market OxyContin trafficking. A 2014 study looked at 11 years of data, finding that deaths from opioid painkillers plummet in states with legal weed. A 2015 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that states with medical cannabis dispensaries have reduced levels of opioid addiction and deaths. The same year, a survey discovered that 80% of respondents reported substituting cannabis for prescription pills. Big Pharma must have been paying attention, as companies such as Insys Therapeutics were helping to fund propaganda campaigns against numerous state-level cannabis legalization initiatives. In 2016, another study confirmed the positive effects of legal medical cannabis. Researchers looked at 17 states over a three-year period (2010-2013), showing yet again that prescription drug use falls in legal weed states. \u201cGenerally, we found that when a medical marijuana law went into effect, prescribing for FDA-approved prescription drugs under Medicare Part D fell substantially,\u201d said researchers. They estimated that if all 50 states would have legal cannabis therapy, $486 million in prescription drug savings could be achieved annually. You would think this to be good news for federal government, which presumably should be looking for ways to reduce spending. However, when Congress developed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, all attempts to including medical cannabis research or use were blocked -- despite clear data on its ability to address the opioid epidemic. Clearly, the interests of Big Pharma continue to be protected by government at the expense of the people\u2019s health. Despite the best efforts of crony lawmakers and a DEA floundering in ignorance by keeping cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug with \u201c no medical use,\u201d people are fully awake to the reality of medical cannabis, with nearly 90 percent saying it should be legal.",

        "text":"Bronson, FL \u2014 When coworkers of Florida sheriff's detective Trent Kellee Freeman, 38, found out that she was deathly ill with COVID-19, they donated their sick-leave hours to her, as they prayed for her swift return. After weeks of hoping she'd get better, Freeman's fellow cops had their prayers answered \u2014 but not like they had thought. Although Freeman was not sick, she had never been sick, and was faking the entire thing. As she duped her fellow Gilchrist County deputies for weeks, Freeman was actually working another full-time job, outside of police work. She had constructed an elaborate hoax to defraud her fellow deputies of their sick leave while double dipping at another job. \u201cAgents discovered that Freeman filed multiple sets of fraudulent Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) paperwork, forging the signatures of area doctors to support her false claims of extensive hospitalization for severe COVID-19 and other medical issues,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement released earlier this month. When the agency saw inconsistencies with Freeman's paperwork, it requested Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. According to the Miami Herald, \"the probe ultimately found that Freeman was indeed not sick, but employed full time elsewhere in the private sector. While working in the non-law-enforcement position, the 38-year-old \u201csolicited and received hundreds of donated sick leave hours from her colleagues,\u201d defrauding GCSO of approximately $3,727.\" \u201cWe believe in accountability at the Gilchrist County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is why we brought this case to FDLE,\u201d said Gilchrist County Sheriff Bobby Schultz in a press conference. \u201cNo matter the circumstances or situation, we will strive to make sure our employees do the right thing at all times. This is an unfortunate situation, but this in no way represents the men and women as a whole who work at the Gilchrist County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve seen law enforcement officers get in trouble, to this magnitude of what she did and how she took advantage of the goodness of her fellow employees is saddening,\u201d Schultz said, adding the agency is seeking restitution. According to the report, Freeman went to great lengths to defraud her fellow deputies, including faking hospitalization, even claiming she was in a coma. After discovering the fraud, a warrant was issued for her arrest and she was charged with two counts of uttering a forged instrument and one count of scheme to defraud. Freeman turned herself in earlier this month and was booked into the Levy County Jail on a $50,000 bond. While this case may seem outlandish, TFTP has reported on cops defrauding or stealing from their fellow officers before. In September, Jeremy Kevitt, the president of the Clermont Police Officers Union was arrested for stealing from his fellow cops. Kevitt was arrested on Labor Day for allegedly stealing $50,000 from his own union, including the theft of money from a fund set up to pay for the medical bills of a wounded cop. For years, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Kevitt abused his position as the union president. In 2014, he began the theft by obtaining an ATM card to the police union bank account. No one on the union board approved the measure. When cops have to watch out for fellow cops stealing from them, it may be time to admit we have a problem within American law enforcement.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/dad-arrested-playing-park-daughter-social-distancing",
        "text":"Brighton, CO \u2014 Over the weekend, Matt Mooney, his wife, and their 6-year-old daughter were playing t-ball at an empty park when a half dozen cops showed up and kidnapped Mooney. The family was not in violation of any law, were obeying social distancing mandates, and had harmed absolutely no one. Mooney tells TFTP that the city issued an order that all parks were closed during the COVID-19 shutdown. However, the open spaces at the parks were still accessible as long as certain rules were followed. In fact, the sign at the park at which Mooney and his family were playing read as follows: \"Closed\" but just below that part, the sign reads, \u201cin groups of no more than 4 persons, parks remain open for walking, hiking, biking, running and similar activities.\u201d Mooney was in a group of three and violated none of the park's or city's rules. The only people violating the social distancing guidelines were the cops who showed up to arrest him. Mooney tells TFTP that the cops showed up \"and attempted to kick everyone out of the open space claiming parks are closed.\" But they were wrong. Knowing he was not violating any law, Mooney questioned the officers' unlawful order. \"I stood up for my rights and told them I wasn't leaving and they could write me a ticket,\" he said. Seeing the officers approach their family apparently made Mooney's daughter a little uneasy. \u201cShe's like, \u2018Daddy, I don't want you to get arrested.' At this point I'm thinking, 'There's no way they're going to arrest me, this is insane.' I'm telling her, \u2018Don't worry, Daddy's not going to get arrested. I've done nothing wrong. Don't worry about it,\u2019 and then they arrest me.\" When cops asked for his identification, Mooney tells TFTP that he refused because he \"had done nothing wrong.\" Indeed, he had done absolutely nothing wrong and the only people in violation of anything were the half dozen cops who then kidnapped Mooney in front of his child. A vigilant citizen, former city councilman Kirby Wallin was nearby and watched the scene unfold. He did what everyone should do when watching police violate the rights of the innocent and he pulled out his cellphone to record. \u201cHe\u2019s being taken by the Brighton police for playing softball with his daughter in an empty park,\" Wallin said on the video. In an interview with FOX 31 Denver \u2014 who also picked up Mooney's story \u2014 Wallin said, \u201cI find it hard to believe with all the things going on in our communities, the only way to resolve a situation like this was to handcuff a father in front of his daughter.\u201d \"They arrested me in front of my 6 year old daughter and put me in the cop car,\" Mooney tells TFTP. \"Ten minutes later they pulled me out of the car and released me.\" Mooney is now worried, and rightfully so, that the cops who were wearing no PPE and were in clear violation of the social distancing guidelines, potentially exposed this innocent family to COVID-19. \u201cDuring the contact, none of the officers had masks on, none of them had gloves on, and they\u2019re in my face handcuffing me, they\u2019re touching me,\" he said. Since this ridiculous kidnapping and police violation of social distancing happened, police have been tight-lipped, releasing only a vague statement on their Facebook page, which is sure to receive plenty of criticism after our readers click this link. \"The Brighton Police Department is currently conducting an investigation into a situation that occurred late this afternoon at Donelson Park. This is an active investigation and we are unable to provide additional information until the investigation is complete.\" As for Matt Mooney, he just wants an apology \u2014 which he clearly deserves. \u201cIf we're going to go ahead and start arresting people for no reason in front of their 6-year-old daughter, you're just going to cause more problems later on,\" he said. Indeed. UPDATE: After the publishing of this article, on Tuesday, acting Brighton City Manager Marv Falconburg called Mooney to try to arrange a meeting with BPD Cmdr. Frank Acosta to offer an apology on behalf of the police department, according to KDVR. \u201cFalconburg conveyed an apology, however, Mr. Mooney has declined the offer for an in person meeting,\u201d BPD said via email.",

        "title":"Video Shows Cop Beating Unarmed Man After Alleged Social Distancing Violation",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/police-brutality-cop-watch\/nypd-social-distancing-arrest",
        "text":"Manhattan, NY \u2014 A disturbing video began making its way around social media over the weekend after it showed a cop punching and attacking a man over an alleged social distancing violation. The NYPD cop has been placed on modified duty since the video went viral. The video showed a raging NYPD cop charging at bystanders on a Manhattan street with a Taser in his hand, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Sunday. \u201cI am aware of the video that\u2019s out there. It\u2019s being investigated currently by our Internal Affairs Bureau,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThe results of that very preliminary investigation that\u2019s ongoing: There was one officer who was modified, and that\u2019s where we stand right now.\u201d As the video shows, NYPD officers were involved in a violent arrest of a man and a woman outside of a store. NYPD says the man was getting arrested for improperly social distancing. According to PIX11, a group of people were standing on the corner of Avenue D and East 9th Street around 5:30 p.m. when officers told them to leave, according to an NYPD spokesperson. Most of the group complied, but some remained on the corner, the spokesperson said in a statement. When the remaining stragglers failed to disperse, that's when police became violent and defeated the entire purpose of social distancing in the first place. As police were violently arresting Shakiem Brunson, 31, and Ashley Serrano, 22, Donni Wright was one of many bystanders filming and observing the arrests. For some reason, the officer dressed in plainclothes left the arrest he was making and demanded Wright \"get the f**k back!\" Wright was well over 20 feet away from the arrest and did not appear to be interfering at all. Nevertheless the officer charged at him while cycling his taser in some attempt to intimidate the man. Wright appeared to back up as the officer charged him but when he got to the street, he couldn't back up anymore. That's when the cop started beating him. The officer is seen punching Wright in the face multiple times as he takes him to the ground. At no point was Wright fighting back or resisting. Another officer then puts Wright into handcuffs as the attacking cop kneels on his head. According to PIX 11: Brunson, was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, criminal possession of a weapon, disorderly conduct and unlawful possession of marijuana, police said. Serrano of Hicksville, was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, criminal possession of a weapon and disorderly conduct, according to police. Wright was also charged after police said he \"took a fighting stance against the officer.\" Wright, 33, of Manhattan, was charged with assaulting a police officer, menacing, resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, police said. While the charges against Brunson and Serrano may stick, prosecutors will have a hard time keeping these trumped up charges against Wright, especially with the mayor of New York speaking out against his arrest. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he \"was really disturbed by it.\" \"The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable,\" he said. City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who represents the neighborhood, also spoke out publicly against the officer's actions in the video. \"Regardless of what transpired before the video, what is the justification for the rage? Where's the professionalism and de-escalation tactics we should expect? We will hold these officers accountable,\" she said on Twitter. This video is an indicator showing just how far some cops are willing to go to follow their orders. Had this activity taken place in the beginning of March, rest assured that cops wouldn't have even been on the scene as there was no violation. Now, however, as lower-income folks with no where to go, gather outside, this is used as a pretext for violence and kidnapping. If there is a silver lining to all this, it is the fact that this treatment of people by police is finally getting the attention of the right who have largely ignored police brutality by claiming anyone killed or beaten by a cop likely deserved it. Now, however, we are seeing MAGA folks share these videos, as seen below. When both parties stand against police brutality, the days violent cops get to keep their jobs and freedom become numbered.",

        "title":"Amid COVID-19 Outbreak, Arrests Plummet, Departments Close and Chaos Does NOT Ensue",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/be-the-change\/decline-arrests-police-chaos",
        "text":"As TFTP reported last week, prisons across the country are facing potential massive outbreaks inside their walls and are being forced to make the decision to release non-violent offenders to stave off catastrophe. Thousands of non-violent prisoners have been released and there has not been an uptick in criminal activity. What's more, according to multiple reports, arrests are plummeting, and a department in Illinois has entirely shut down. While the typical fearful citizen might read the above actions and lose their mind, thinking it is the end of the world and crime will run rampant, the reality is much different. Crime is in free fall. According to a recent report out of Buffalo, NY, the number of daily arrests before the pandemic typically exceeded 20 a day, including a recent high of 37 on March 6. Arrests since Thursday have ranged from two to eight a day. The drop in arrests comes as people are told to stay home and businesses are closed. While the crime drop is attributed in part to the stoppage of commerce, police are also changing their roles during this crisis from kicking in doors to arrest people for a plant to patrolling the streets for safety. What's more, Buffalo Police department Captain Jeff Rinaldo pointed to the New York State bail reform that went into effect at the beginning of the year. As a result of the reform, police now issue appearance tickets for most minor crimes, resulting in them taking fewer people into custody. \u201cBecause of bail reform and because we have so many people out of custody, they\u2019re able to care for themselves, care for families, be nimble, flexible, respond to this pandemic,\u201d said Kevin Stadelmaier, the chief attorney for Buffalo Legal Aid\u2019s Criminal Defense Unit. Imagine that! By allowing people to remain free for committing entirely victimless crimes \u2014 instead of ruining their lives through incarceration \u2014 the government is able to stave off the potential for future crime, otherwise known as recidivism. While Buffalo is reducing arrests, other cities, like Blue Island, Il., have disbanded their entire department. After an officer tested positive for COVID-19, Mayor Domingo Vargas made the decision to shut down the department. Naturally, the mayor is receiving backlash from other elected officials. State Representative Bob Rita criticized Vargas' action, saying, \"At no point did the Mayor's office contact my office, any member of the City Council or any other local leaders in making this rash decision.\" Despite the backlash, Blue Island has not seen an uptick in crime. In New York City, crime has fallen as well. According to the NY Daily News, crime dropped 25% in the five boroughs during the coronavirus shutdown last week \u2014 with just one person murdered compared to eight the week before, authorities said Monday. Each of the seven major crimes that determine the overall crime rate \u2014 murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto \u2014 declined compared to the week before, according to NYPD statistics. This drop in crime was expected given the fact that New Yorkers are on lockdown, but as TFTP has reported before, even when cops simply refused to do make arrests and write tickets when citizens were on the streets, the city did not descend into chaos. In September, the NYPD threw a temper tantrum after Police Commissioner James O'Neill fired the killer cop who choked the life out of Eric Garner on video in 2014. The temper tantrum resulted in a plunge in arrests, but it did not lead to a spike in crime or violence \u2014 illustrating how most of the \"policing\" done in the US, is little more than revenue generation. We saw a similar reaction in December 2014 when the NYPD threw their first temper tantrum over the reaction to Eric Garner's death and simply stopped doing their jobs. During the work stoppage, the city set a record for the lowest numbers of murders in the history of the NYPD. As we reported at the time, the numbers were far more drastic than the current slowdown. Citations for traffic violations fell by 94 percent, from 10,069 to 587, during that time frame. Summonses for low-level offenses like public drinking and urination also plunged 94 percent \u2014 from 4,831 to 300. Even parking violations are way down, dropping by 92 percent, from 14,699 to 1,241. Drug arrests by cops assigned to the NYPD\u2019s Organized Crime Control Bureau \u2014 which are part of the overall number \u2014 dropped by 84 percent, from 382 to 63. The decline in crime coinciding with the decline in police activity essentially made the case that most policing carried out in the United States is done so for the purpose of revenue collection and not to fight crime. Drug offenses, parking violations, and traffic citations are not so much crimes, as they are streams of revenue for the city. They are also the reason for the majority of police harassment within particular communities; harassment that is being proven entirely unnecessary as the COVID-19 crisis continues. Imagine a police force that acted more like firefighters or EMTs. Firefighters don't have to go door to door looking for fires, in order to be effective. EMTs, just like firefighters wait for a call before reacting and their services are oft proven invaluable contrary to that of police work. Perhaps this recent chaos can be used to channel this notion to the forefront and completely revamp the idea of policing in the land of the free.",

        "title":"WATCH: \\'Hero\\' Cops Arrest Elderly Man for Trying to Run His Compliant Business During Pandemic",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/elderly-businessman-humiliated-detained",
        "text":"Winslow, AZ \u2014 For all intents and purposes, Native American trinket and souvenir dealer Daniel J. Mazon was attempting to comply with the closure of non-essential businesses in Winslow, Arizona where his roadside business is located. He got his business license changed on to read \"Indian Department Store\" in March. But that wasn't enough for Winslow police to leave the 71-year-old man alone. They continued coming by his business, even after he'd changed his business license, ordering him to close, and justifying it by saying they got calls from concerned citizens the elderly man was running a business which wasn't essential. Mazon remarked: Corona Bologna Once again, after showing responding officers his new business license and declaring he is selling hay, food, and dog food, Mazon believed he had done all he needed to do to comply with the COVID-19 restrictions. However, this time, the officers decided to place the man in handcuffs for the simple act of defying to give them his driver's license. In his elderly mind he \"was not driving\" so why should he have to provide a driver's license. Cops told the man he was being arrested and he then said he'd give them his driver's license. But it was too late. They put the cuffs on him, stuffed him into the back of a squad car, and gave the money from his wallet, which they'd seized, to his wife. She was so distraught she started sharing religious messages with the police who we presume would just say they were \"doing their jobs\". Unconvinced Mazon was an \"essential business\" one officer stated his store, based on his perception: Does not qualify as a department store. The elderly businessman accused the police officers of not understanding the law, violating his constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and to not be unlawfully arrested. He told the men: You guys don't have a right to touch me or even handle me In the end, Mazon stood his ground, and avoided arrest but he declared he was \"close enough in compliance to your violation.\" He also hinted that he would continue to run his business even though the detaining officer told him once again to \"stay closed\". Mazon wasn't hurting anyone, was selling essential goods, and had attempted to comply by getting his license changed. Mind you, feed and seed stores were open, pet stores were open, and Mazon was simply trying to make a living by meeting the buying needs of the public during an epidemic. Officers eventually relented in their pursuit to arrest Mazon, deciding to give him a citation, after all. Why other businesses can remain open (which are large department chains usually) and why small businesses like Mazon's are forced to close remains a mystery to many Americans, actually spurring protests all throughout the United States. Let's be clear. Had Mr. Mazon attempted to resist arrest in any way, those police officers who presumably have elderly parents of their own, would have thrown him to the ground, and violently kidnapped the man away from his business and wife, all to enforce the dictatorial mandate of Governor Doug Ducey. It is becoming clearer with every passing day the basis upon which COVID-19 restrictions were put into place is starting to crumble. While the pandemic is killing thousands of people, overall the virus is apparently not as dangerous as first suspected and continuing to deprive citizens of the right to work is leading to further chaos and needless confrontations with police. In Mazon's own words to one of the officers who later returned his cell phone: Are you worried about corona? It's nonsense. It's used to take over our country. Someone give Mr. Mazon a medal for standing up for what he believes in the face of two badge wearing men with guns. Not only did he not get arrested, he showed everyone who wants to work during the so-called quarantine just how to attempt to legally do it. He got his business license changed to demonstrate he's an essential business and he did not back down even when threatened with arrest. Mr. Mazon, we at TFTP salute you. Thank you for your service.",

        "title":"Over 800 Arrested Protesting Breonna Taylor\\'s Death As 0 Cops Are Arrested for Killing Her",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/800-protesting-taylor-arrested-police",
        "text":"On September 23, knowing that there would be backlash for their decision, streets in downtown Louisville were blocked off officials, police put on high alert, and government buildings were boarded up as officials announced the charges against former officer Brett Hankison for his role in the raid which left Breonna Taylor dead. The subsequent outrage was well deserved as Hankison was not charged for anything that led to the death of Taylor. Instead, this trigger happy cowboy cop was charged with \"first degree wanton endangerment\" for shooting like a madman into neighboring apartments during the raid. Despite Taylor being completely innocent and murdered while unarmed inside of her own home, and despite her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, being ruled justified in shooting at the officers during the raid \u2014 not a single cop has faced a slap on the wrist for actions that left this hero EMT dying in her own hallway. On the contrary, however, the Free Thought Project has examined multiple reports and over 200 people have been arrested protesting Taylor's death in Louisville alone. In just one night, after the charges were announced, police arrested 127 people in Louisville for protesting. While a handful of the arrests were for actual crimes, the majority of arrests were for curfew violations and protesting without permission \u2014 otherwise known as unlawful assembly. Journalists were not safe either. According to a report in Forbes, in a single night two journalists from The Daily Caller were also arrested, according to editor-in-chief Geoffrey Ingersoll, who said Shelby Talcott and Jorge Ventura will be charged with two misdemeanors related to breaking curfew and unlawful assembly for their \u201calleged failure to comply with police orders to disperse and for press to relegate themselves to an \u2018observation area.\u2019\u201d On the second night, even more people were arrested, and again, it was not for harming people or property. It was for \"unlawful assembly.\" Police often use the unlawful assembly tactic to clear protests and then resort to a tactic referred to as \"kettling.\" An unlawful assembly is declared and large cordons of police officers move to contain a crowd within a limited area. Protesters are left only one choice of exit controlled by the police where they face arrest \u2013 or are completely prevented from leaving \u2014 with the effect of denying the protesters access to food, water and toilet facilities for a time period determined by the police forces. Essentially, people who stay out past the curfew are being kettled by cops who do not allow them to leave and then are tear gassed, pepper sprayed, beaten with batons, and then arrested. Illustrating the arbitrary nature of the arrests is the fact that during the second night of protests in Louisville, State Rep. Attica Scott was arrested and charged with first-degree rioting, a felony, and two misdemeanor counts: unlawful assembly and failure to disperse. According to Scott, she had done no such rioting however, and was merely out past curfew and part of an unlawful assembly. \u201cRight now I\u2019m very disgusted and angry that LMPD (Louisville Metro Police Department) would levy these false charges against me ... and other folks,\u201d Scott told reporters after the arrest. The following night, more people were arrested and assaulted by police as they protested the death of Breonna Taylor. If we look as far back as July, we count well over 300 arrests of protesters attempting to seek justice for Breonna Taylor. And, according to NBC, since protests began in Louisville, the police have made roughly 800 arrests, from a \"Granny for Breonna\" to children as young as 13, police data shows. This has been the case, not only in Louisville but in cities across the country as thousands have been arrested and brutalized while protesting police killings. Yes, we understand that some of the people involved in protesting. As we reported, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping project that collects raw data on political violence and protest events across the world, found that the US has seen an unprecedented surge in protests in 2020. In a short time frame, ACLED recorded more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country. While many will attempt to paint all the protests as violent, 95% or rather 10,100 took place without property damage or violence. While 95% is certainly the overwhelming majority, that does leave over 500 protests which devolved into demonstrators engaging in violence and property damage. Hundreds of instances of property damage and violence is no small number but in comparison to the total number of protests, it certainly is. Those enacting violence and destruction and theft wholeheartedly deserve to be held accountable for their actions. Those who are arrested for merely having a voice against police brutality, however, serve as ominous indicators of the encroaching police state. When protesting police brutality is met with more police brutality, it may be time to rethink the role of law enforcement in America.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/cop-life-in-prison-covid-lockdown-rules",
        "text":"In the last 18 months, across the planet, we've witnessed utterly horrifying acts of police violence while cops enforce the government's tyrannical COVID lockdown rules. Business owners and citizens who flouted lockdowns have been arrested, beaten, jailed, and even family gatherings have been raided like they are child trafficking rings. None of these instances, however, have compared to the case of Sarah Everard, 33, who was kidnapped by an officer under the guise of enforcing COVID lockdowns, only to be raped and beaten to death. On that fateful night back in March 2021, Everard was walking home from her friend's house and had almost made it home. When officer Wayne Couzens, 48, spotted the young woman on the sidewalk, even though he was not on duty at the time, he used his police credentials to claim Everard was breaking the lockdown rules. Everard, who is described as shining light in the community, didn't resist because she thought she may have actually broken some rule. Witnesses in Clapham, a neighborhood in South London where Everard was kidnapped, described seeing a man in dark clothing handcuffing a young woman before putting her in the back of the car and driving off. The victim had been \"compliant, with her head down and did not appear to be arguing,\" witness Tom Little told the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales. He said because there was no struggle, he assumed it was an undercover cop arresting a woman who had done something wrong. Because Everard had been described as \"savvy and streetwise\" it was unlikely that she would get into a vehicle with someone unknown \"unless by force or by manipulation,\" Little said, , The Times of London reported. \"That is precisely what happened,\" he said as prosecutors pointed out how Couzens used the excuse of COVID lockdowns to abduct his victim. On March 10, 2021, 7 days after she was kidnapped, Everard's body was found over 50 miles away in the town of Ashford. She had been brutally raped and strangled to death. The hashtag #shewasonlywalkinghome began trending shortly after. \"Sarah Everard was only walking home when she was taken off the street,\" Little continued. \"However, those five words do not fairly or completely begin to describe what happened to her\" after she was kidnapped. Little said that \"while it is impossible to summarize\" what Couzens did in just five words, \"if it had to be done, then it would be appropriate to do so as 'deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire.'\" On Wednesday, Couzens pleaded guilty to using the pretext of coronavirus regulations to abduct Everard so that he could rape and strangle her. During the investigation, it would be revealed that Everard's death may have been preventable as Couzens could have been arrested for a prior crime \u2014 but was apparently given blue privilege instead. According to police, Couzens had been accused of multiple \"flashing\" incidents in which he was exposing himself to random people in public days before he kidnapped Everard. However, he was not arrested for it. According to a report in Newsweek, Scotland Yard said it would not comment until the investigation into the alleged failures was complete, but said in a statement, \"we are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes which betray everything we stand for.\" At his trial on Wednesday, protesters outside the courtroom held up signs noting that the Metropolitan police department \"has blood on their hands\" for allowing Couzens to remain free despite his crimes. If they had information that could have put him away, and they chose not to, blood is indeed on their hands. On Thursday, Couzens was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",

        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/be-the-change\/police-sheriffs-refuse-enforce-thanksgiving-dictates",
        "text":"Last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom made headlines for all the wrong reasons after releasing his office's requirements for Thanksgiving. The dictates were ostensibly put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 but quickly got called out for their arbitrary and tyrannical nature. Below is a summary of the Governor's orders for a \"safe\" Thanksgiving day celebration: -Must be held outside; -Guests may use bathroom inside if sanitized; -Masks on while not eating; -Singing \u201cstrongly discouraged;\u201d -Max of two hours together; -6 feet *mandated* in all directions between all at guests at the table & otherwise. -10 p.m. curfew While some folks lauded Newsom for his tyranny as necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, they ended up with egg on their faces after the governor himself was caught breaking several of his office's own measures. Recently, Newson was caught and exposed flouting his own ridiculous strictures on eating in restaurants -- not putting his mask back on between bites (yes, he really mandated this) -- while breaking the size limit on gatherings. When he was caught dining at one of the world's most expensive restaurants, he lied to the public and said the table was outside. But photos quickly surfaced, outing his lies. After being caught in a steaming hot pile of hypocrisy, Newsom's credibility in dealing with the virus has been diminished to virtually non-existent. As a result, sheriff's and police departments in Southern California have come out noting that they will not be enforcing his tyranny. \"We\u2019ve now heard from every Sheriff in our SoCal viewing area. San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, & Riverside Counties will not actively enforce the curfew order. LA Sheriff will take a voluntary compliance\/education first approach, will not make any arrests related to order,\" FOX LA's Bill Melugin We\u2019ve now heard from every Sheriff in our SoCal viewing area. San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, & Riverside Counties will not actively enforce the curfew order. LA Sheriff will take a voluntary compliance\/education first approach, will not make any arrests related to order @FOXLA \u2014 Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) November 20, 2020 \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tweeted over the weekend. But it wasn't just the sheriff's department. \"We\u2019ve heard from the Sheriffs, we are now starting to hear from from city police departments about the curfew. Ontario and Laguna Beach PDs say they will NOT actively enforce the order, seeking voluntary compliance. Costa Mesa and Irvine PDs WILL take part in enforcement,\" Melugin followed up. The revolt has since gained traction and it is spreading outside of southern California. Other sheriffs in Northern California, including Sacramento County, where the Governor now lives, are also refusing to enforce the curfew. \"In these challenging times, there is a great deal of fear, anxiety and uncertainty within the community,\" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said in a statement. \"I do not wish to compound those concerns by creating distrust and friction between residents and law enforcement.\" \"El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies will not be determining compliance with, or enforcing the compliance of, any health order related to this curfew. The sheriff\u2019s office will not prevent Thanksgiving activities, maximum occupancies, or mask wearing mandates at social gatherings within the County of El Dorado,\" a similar statement from the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office said. \"The Manteca Police Department will not arrest people for violating this order,\" the Manteca PD announced, adding, \"Manteca Police Officers will NOT come to your home, stop your car, or interrogate your family based simply on this order.\" The list of police and sheriffs departments openly defying the governor's orders continues to grow. Now, Newsom is facing an existing recall effort, with a deadline of March 17, 2021 to collect 1,495,709 valid signatures. With his recent documented hypocrisy and arbitrary tyranny, this petition will likely reach its goal. While police and sheriffs disobeying the governor by refusing to enforce his Thanksgiving tyranny is certainly a welcome gesture, it also exposes their selective approach to what they deem \"constitutional.\" Every single one of the departments mentioned above continue to enforce the unconstitutional war on drugs by kidnapping and caging people for possessing arbitrary substances deemed illegal by the state. Every single one of these departments mentioned above also continues the enforcement of arbitrary dictates for victimless crimes which target poor and minority communities. Hopefully, as more people realize that the enforcement of victimless crimes comes from the same people who are showing their willingness to disobey other orders with which they disagree, they will pressure their police and sheriffs departments to uphold the rights of all citizens, not just the ones they agree with politically.",

        "text":"La Mesa, CA \u2014 According to the family of Leslie Furcron, she just buried her son in February after he was killed by police for running from them. They say cops approached him with guns drawn, scaring him, so he ran. Unfortunately, they would kill him over this. Illustrating the level of suffering faced by so many communities across the country, as Furcron peacefully marched to protest the death of her son and police brutality in general, she was shot between her eyes by a cop firing a rubber bullet. Furcron is currently in the Intensive Care Unit and her family is unable to visit her due to COVID-19 restrictions. She is unable to talk and doctors are unsure if they will be able to save her eye. The only thing that Mrs. Leslie was doing when she was shot in the middle of the head with a near-deadly projectile, was filming and talking. According to her family, Furcron, lost her son during the beginning of the year, so she decided to take her voice to the streets to be heard. Furcron was entirely peaceful and simply practicing her first amendment right to voice her anger over police killings. As the video shows, around the ten minute mark, Furcron is filming cops on top of the buildings who were reportedly firing rubber bullets into the crowd. \"Look, they are shooting people,\" Furcron says as rounds go off in the background. \"They're murderers! They're murderers!\" she yells. As Furcron turns the camera back to herself momentarily, another round goes off and that one hit her right between the eyes. She then goes down. The aftermath of the shot was gut wrenching as folks around her went into panic thinking she was dead. The round can be seen sticking out from her head as the innocent grandmother fades in and out of consciousness. It takes one sadistic and heartless individual to shoot an unarmed, innocent grandmother in between her eyes as she practiced her constitutional right to free speech. And yet these are the people who claim to \"protect\" society. This is why people are in the streets. According to her family, Furcron is still in the hospital. \"Right now she's in a stable condition and dealing with the situation. We're keeping our prayers out for her. She's a very strong woman who's always been there for our family and always wanted other people to be happy. So, right now we're hoping all the people out there can give that energy back and help her get well and also work toward justice,\" said the woman's son, Azim Furcron Sanders. \"When I first saw her it was kind of crazy to see my mom like that with a tube down her throat. It kind of made me tear up for a second. I was used to seeing her bright smile, or yelling at me or talking about something. So, to see her like that really shocked me. I was like, how could you do her like that? I know black men have been involved in a lot of stuff but I couldn't believe they would actually shoot an innocent black, grandmother in her face with her hands up. So, I was really hurt about it,\" said her son Ahmed Furcron. \"The police need to be held accountable. There are consequences to these police actions that will bring harm and death to anybody anywhere, especially over and over again to black people. There are consequences. They can either hold their rogue officers accountable and provide us with the peace and justice that we have been pleading and begging for, or they will get some of the same of what they've been getting. We will continue to fight. We will continue to stand up. We will continue to resist the state-sanctioned actions of murdering, and slaughtering and injuring severely our black women, our black men, our black children and any of our people of color,\" Community activist Tasha Williamson told News 8. According to CBS 8 the La Mesa Police Department did not respond to multiple email and telephone message requests for comment. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department issued a statement to News 8 saying the incident, \"did not involve a Sheriff's deputy\" and advised News 8 to contact La Mesa police. WARNING.

        "text":"(Brownstone) \u2014 It was a good but bizarre day when the CDC finally reversed itself fundamentally on its messaging for two-and-a-half years. The source is the MMWR report of August 11, 2022. The title alone shows just how deeply the about-face was buried: Summary of Guidance for Minimizing the Impact of COVID-19 on Individual Persons, Communities, and Health Care Systems \u2014 United States, August 2022. The authors: \u201cthe CDC Emergency Response Team\u201d consisting of \u201cGreta M. Massetti, PhD; Brendan R. Jackson, MD; John T. Brooks, MD; Cria G. Perrine, PhD; Erica Reott, MPH; Aron J. Hall, DVM; Debra Lubar, PhD;; Ian T. Williams, PhD; Matthew D. Ritchey, DPT; Pragna Patel, MD; Leandris C. Liburd, PhD; Barbara E. Mahon, MD.\u201d It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall in the brainstorming sessions that led to this little treatise. The wording was chosen very carefully, not to say anything false outright, much less admit any errors of the past, but to imply that it was only possible to say these things now. \u201cAs SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post\u2013COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death. These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity.\u201c In English: everyone can pretty much go back to normal. Focus on illness that is medically significant. Stop worrying about positive cases because nothing is going to stop them. Think about the bigger picture of overall social health. End the compulsion. Thank you. It\u2019s only two and a half years late. What about mass testing? Forget it: \u201cAll persons should seek testing for active infection when they are symptomatic or if they have a known or suspected exposure to someone with COVID-19.\u201d Oh. What about the magic of track and trace? \u201cCDC now recommends case investigation and contact tracing only in health care settings and certain high-risk congregate settings.\u201d Oh. What about the unvaccinated who were so demonized throughout the last year? \u201cCDC\u2019s COVID-19 prevention recommendations no longer differentiate based on a person\u2019s vaccination status because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally mild, and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection.\u201d Remember when 40% of the members of the black community in New York City who refused the jab were not allowed into restaurants, bars, libraries, museums, or theaters? Now, no one wants to talk about that. Also, universities, colleges, the military, and so on \u2013 which still have mandates in place \u2013 do you hear this? Everything you have done to hate on people, dehumanize people, segregate people, humiliate others as unclean, fire people and destroy lives, now stands in disrepute. Meanwhile, as of this writing, the blasted US government still will not allow unvaccinated travelers across its borders! Not one word of the CDC\u2019s turgid treatise was untrue back in the Spring of 2020. There was always \u201cinfection-induced immunity,\u201d though Fauci and Co. constantly pretended otherwise. It was always a terrible idea to introduce \u201cbarriers to social, educational, and economic activity.\u201d The vaccines never promised in their authorization to stop infection and spread, even though all official statements of the CDC claimed otherwise, repeatedly and often. You might also wonder how the great reversal treats masking. On this subject, there is no backing off. After all, the Biden administration still has an appeal in process to reverse the court decision that the mask mandate was illegal all along. \u201cAt the high COVID-19 Community Level,\u201d the CDC adds, \u201cadditional recommendations focus on all persons wearing masks indoors in public and further increasing protection to populations at high risk.\u201d The problem from the beginning was that there never was an exit strategy from the crazy lockdown\/mandate idea. It was never the case that they would magically cause the bug to go away. The excuse that we would lock down in wait for a vaccine never made any sense. People surely knew early on of the social, economic, and cultural devastation that would ensue. If they did not, they never should have been anywhere near the control switches of public health. Badges and bureaucracies do not terrify a virus destined to spread to the whole planet. And not one person with even the most casual passing knowledge of coronaviruses could have sincerely believed that a vaccine would magically appear to achieve something never before achieved in the whole history of medicine. When the Great Barrington Declaration appeared on October 4, 2020, it caused a global frenzy of fury not because it said anything new. It was merely a pithy restatement of basic public-health principles, which pretty much instantly became verboten on March 16, 2020, when Fauci\/Birx announced their grand scheme. The GBD generated mania because the existing praxis was based on preposterously unproven claims that demanded that billions of people buy into complete nonsense. Sadly many did simply because it seemed hard to believe that all world regimes but a handful would push such a damaging policy if it was utterly unworkable. When something like that happens \u2013 and there never was the hope that it could work \u2013 the regime imperative becomes censorship and shaming of dissent. It\u2019s the only way to hold the great lie together. So finally, nearly two years later the CDC has embraced the Great Barrington Declaration rather than doing a \u201cquick and devastating takedown\u201d as Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci called for the day after its release. No, they had to try out their new theory on the rest of us. It did not work, obviously. For the authors of the GBD, they knew from the time they penned the document that it was a matter of time before they were vindicated. They never doubted it. Dr. Rajeev Venkayya is widely credited with coming up with the idea of lockdowns while he was working for the Bush administration back in 2005. He had no training at all in public health or epidemiology. He later marveled that it fell to him, a young desk-dwelling White House bureaucrat, to \u201cinvent pandemic planning.\u201d Maybe he should have demurred that day that George W. Bush asked him to lead the charge to inaugurate a new war on pathogens. Somehow his views gained converts, among whom was Bill Gates, the foundation for whom he worked for years. The rest is history. In April 2020, Venkayya called me to explain why I needed to stop attacking lockdowns. He said that the planners need a chance to make their scheme work. On the phone, I asked the same question over and over: where does the virus go? The first two times, he did not respond. I pressed and pressed. Finally he said there will be a vaccine. It\u2019s hard to appreciate just how preposterous that sounded at the time, and I said something along those lines: it would be a medical miracle never before seen to have a shot for a coronavirus that was sterilizing against wild type and all inevitable mutations, and to do it in a reasonable time so that society and economy had not completely fallen apart. The whole approach was clearly milliennarian at best and utter madness at worst. And here I was, in the thick of global lockdowns, on the phone with the architect of the whole idea, an idea that had reduced billions to servitude, wrecked schools and churches, and sent communities and countries into complete upheaval. I wondered at the time what it would be like to be Dr. Venkayya that day. After all this ended in disaster, would he take responsibility? His LinkedIn profile today says otherwise: he is prepared to \u201ctackle current and future epidemic & pandemic threats as the CEO of Aerium Therapeutics.\u201d There never was an exit strategy from lockdowns and mandates but they eventually did find an exit nonetheless. It came in the form of a heavily footnoted and opaquely written reversal, published by the main bureaucracy responsible for the disaster. It amounts to a repudiation without saying so. And thus does the great experiment in mass compulsion come to an intellectual end. If only the carnage could be cleaned up by another posting on the CDC\u2019s website. By the way, the Biden administration has extended the declaration of Covid emergency. And my unvaccinated friends in the UK still can\u2019t board a plane to come for a visit. All of this gives rise to the great question: what was the point? Maybe it was all a mistake and now it is gone forever but that\u2019s unlikely. The intellectuals who pushed this project on the world have a view of the world that is fundamentally ill-liberal. They differ among themselves on the details but the general approach is technocratic central planning rooted in deep suspicion of basic tenets of freedom. How many people on the planet have now been acculturated to top-down control, socialized to live in fear, accept whatever comes down from above, never to question an edict, and expect to live in a world of rolling man-made disasters? And was that the point after all, to cultivate low expectations for life on earth and relinquish the soul\u2019s desire for a full and free life?",

        "title":"For the First Time Ever, Lawsuit Targets Billionaire OxyContin Family for Causing Opioid Epidemic",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/the-state\/lawsuit-oxycontin-family-opioid-epidemic",
        "text":"Members of the Sackler family, who've made billions pushing their deadly OxyContin drug on the masses are arguably responsible for more deaths than any Mexican drug cartel. Instead of being hunted down at their plush mansions by DEA agents, they are rubbing elbows with members of Congress. Now, however, for the first time, the family is being targeted by a landmark lawsuit for the damages they knowingly caused with their products. On Tuesday, the state of Massachusetts filed a lawsuit against the multi-billionaire Sackler family over the role their drug OxyContin has played in sparking one of the worst addiction and overdose epidemics in history. The lawsuit accuses the company, Purdue Pharma, and its heirs of spinning a \"web of illegal deceit\" which fueled the deadly crisis in which America currently finds itself. What sets this lawsuit apart from the numerous other lawsuits targeting opioid manufacturers -- including several against Purdue -- is that it has taken the landmark step of personally naming the company's executives. According to Maura Healy, Massachusetts state attorney general, the suit names 16 current and former executives and board members, including the chief executive, Craig Landau, and eight members across three generations of the Sackler family that wholly owns Purdue. \"Purdue Pharma and its executives built a multi-billion-dollar business based on deception and addiction. We're suing,\" Healey tweeted Tuesday. As the Guardian reports, the lawsuit alleges Purdue deceived patients and doctors about the risks of opioids, pushed prescribers to keep patients on the drugs longer and aggressively targeted vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and veterans. \u201cTheir strategy was simple: the more drugs they sold, the more money they made, and the more people died,\u201d Healey said on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Purdue issued a statement in response to the lawsuit in which they denied all allegations. \"We share the attorney general\u2019s concern about the opioid crisis. We are disappointed, however, that in the midst of good faith negotiations with many states, the Commonwealth has decided to pursue a costly and protracted litigation process,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work collaboratively with the states toward bringing meaningful solutions.\u201d According to reports, in just the last decade, in the state of Massachusetts alone, the company sold 70 million doses of prescription opioids, bringing in more than half a billion in revenue. \"It was Purdue's executives who led and directed this illegal business model, leading to addiction and deception to enrich a few while leaving a path of devastation and destruction in its wake,\" Healey said. According to Healey, more than 670 Massachusetts residents have died solely from the result of ingesting the Sackler family's drugs. Purdue, along with several other companies who knowingly pushed opioids on people who did not need them, is facing more than 300 lawsuits from city and county authorities across the country. However, this is the first one which goes after the individuals who became exceedingly wealthy from the sale of this drug. According to the Guardian, the Sacklers being sued are: Theresa and Beverly, the widows of the brothers Mortimer and Raymond Sackler who built the company into the narcotics giant it is today; Ilene, Kathe and Mortimer David Alfons Sackler, three of Mortimer\u2019s children; Jonathan and Richard Sackler, Raymond\u2019s two sons; and David Sackler, Raymond\u2019s grandson. These family members and a number of their siblings and children are collectively worth an estimated $13bn, according to Forbes, with the vast bulk of the fortune generated from sales of OxyContin. Feuding family members have mostly declined to talk about the opioids crisis and avoid discussing their links to it. As TFTP previously reported, Purdue Pharma, under the guidance of brothers Arthur, Raymond, and Mortimer Sackler, began a propaganda campaign to push their new drug, as described in The American Journal of Public Health, \"The Promotion and Marketing of OxyContin: Commercial Triumph, Public Health Tragedy.\" One of the primary missions of Purdue Pharma was to identify the doctors across America prescribing the most pain medication and strategically marketed the drug directly to them as a safe alternative to other pain medications. According to the LA Times: \u201cThe Times\u2019 investigation, published in July, disclosed that for more than a decade, an internal security team at Purdue monitored doctors and pharmacies it suspected of colluding with dealers and addicts. In the case of the L.A. ring, criminals set up a phony clinic near MacArthur Park in 2008 and worked with corrupt physicians and pharmacies to obtain pills over 18 months. A Purdue sales manager dispatched to investigate the high volume of prescriptions at the clinic found a rundown building thronged with rough men and urged supervisors to alert the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying she was \u201cvery certain this is an organized drug ring.\u201d Despite her pleas and additional evidence suggesting that pills were pouring into the hands of criminals, company officials did not go to authorities until years later when the drug ring was out of business and its leaders under indictment. By then, 1.1 million pills had spilled into the illicit pipeline.\u201d These disturbing revelations came after a prior investigation that found Purdue maintained a secret Purdue database of 1,800 suspect doctors, but only about 10 percent of them were reported to law enforcement. As doctors began to readily hand out this new drug, these high dose pills became a scourge across main street America. Drug users increasingly turned to OxyContin for the powerful high and euphoric effects, comparable to heroin, but which can reportedly last for over eight hours. Instead of investigating the company for their overt and dangerous tactics, the government and establishment welcomed them into their ranks. Even after dozens of lawsuits exposing this corruption, in an entirely irresponsible and hypocritical move, the FDA approved a measure to give OxyContin to children. The fact that some people are freely allowed to market potentially deadly drugs, while others are thrown in a cage for the same activity, seems to highlight that not all people are equal in the eyes of the state or the law. Hopefully, this landmark lawsuit will expose this insidious paradigm.",

        "title":"US Govt Finally Admits Medical Cannabis Destroys the Opioid Epidemic",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/the-state\/cannabis-medical-destroys-opioid-government",
        "text":"Study after scientific study expounding on the benefits of cannabis as a veritable panacea has garnered baseline skepticism, if not contempt, from the somnambulant corporate press keener to spew the State\u2019s anti-marijuana nonsense than aligning with science proving government irresponsibly wrong on weed. Scheduled for decades as akin to heroin \u2014 one of the myriad opiates of which the U.S. is currently experiencing an outright crisis \u2014 cannabis has remained the star target of the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s contentious war on drugs. But that may be about to change \u2014 and soon. A dramatic shift in language on the government\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2019s website bears every indication federal prohibition on cannabis\u2019 days are numbered \u2014 specifically, as a means to break the chokehold with which opioid medications have stymied the fight against addiction. \u201cMedical marijuana products may have a role in reducing the use of opioids needed to control pain,\u201d the NIDA website now states \u2014 startlingly in alignment with voluminous government-funded and independent research. In particular, NIDA heralded the results of two studies it funded, one of which \u201cfound an association between medical marijuana legalization and a reduction in overdose deaths from opioid pain relievers.\u201d Further, the website adds, that apparent correlation \u201cstrengthened in each year following the implementation of legislation.\u201d In a highlighted box, the National Institute on Drug Abuse \u2014 still somewhat reserved, though fundamentally transformed, in praise of the miracle plant \u2014 states, \u201cNIDA funded two recent studies that explored the relationship between marijuana legalization and adverse outcomes associated with prescription opioids. The first found an association between medical marijuana legalization and a reduction in overdose deaths from opioid pain relievers, an effect that strengthened in each year following the implementation of legislation. The population-based nature of this study does not establish a causal relationship or give evidence for changes in pain patient behavior. \u201cThe second NIDA-funded study, a more detailed analysis by the RAND Corporation, showed that legally protected access to medical marijuana dispensaries is associated with lower levels of opioid prescribing, lower self-report of nonmedical prescription opioid use, lower treatment admissions for prescription opioid use disorders, and reduction in prescription opioid overdose deaths. Notably, the reduction in deaths was present only in states with dispensaries (not just medical marijuana laws) and was greater in states with active dispensaries.\u201d Hospitals in states where cannabis has been made legal not only failed to see a veritable weed apocalypse in health problems \u2014 a notable non-repercussion, demolishing anti-marijuana propagandists\u2019 favored, but completely baseless, tripe \u2014 but they also experienced plummeting numbers of patients needing treatment for opioid abuse. Simply put, legal availability of weed does not create a health crisis \u2014 and it could be inadvertently solving America\u2019s horrendous opioid epidemic. In states allowing the medical use of cannabis, NBC Newsreported, the rate of opioid abuse and dependence noted by another recent study plunged 23 percent, while overdoses from opioids slid an average of 13 percent. That study, published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence, found no significant correlation in increased hospitalizations for cannabis-related illnesses in states where the plant has been legalized for medical use \u2014 effectively putting to bed that particular demonization of weed by sanctimonious politicians harboring pro-drug war agendas. Rather than proving paranoid warnings legal pot would create a new health crisis, the aforementioned study\u2019s author and public health professor at the University of California, San Diego, Yuyan Shi, told NBC News by email, \u201cInstead, medical marijuana laws may have reduced hospitalizations related to opioid pain relievers. \u201cThis study and a few others provided some evidence regarding the potential positive benefits of legalizing marijuana to reduce opioid use and abuse, but they are still preliminary.\u201d An approximate 60 percent of Americans now reside in the 28 states and District of Columbia where cannabis has been legalized for medical use \u2014 more, still, in round out the number of people with legal, recreational access \u2014 and, in all of those locations, the little plant that can has been destroying decades of politicized anti-pot propaganda. Better still \u2014 and as multitudinous government and independently-funded scientific studies show \u2014 legal cannabis helps alleviate the opioid epidemic currently choking the United States. Emergency medicine professor Dr. Esther Choo, of the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland asserted the previous point could hold merit as a possible solution to opioid addiction \u2014 something NIDA and the U.S. government may also be poised to admit. Via email, Choo told NBC, \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that battling the opioid epidemic will require a multi-pronged approach and a good deal of creativity. Could increased liberalization of marijuana be part of the solution? It seems plausible.\u201d While heroin, morphine, and other illicit opiates contribute handily to the epidemic, legally prescribed opioid painkillers \u2014 such as name brands Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet, and many others \u2014 have been central to the ever-growing crisis, with doctors frequently turning to the societally-acceptable, highly-addictive substances to offer patients relief. This flippant penchant for prescribing opioids damns patients in two ways. First, under-prescribing often leaves those experiencing legitimate, stultifying pain with a set number of pills for relief. Second, terminal prescriptions \u2014 where relief has yet to be achieved for an acute ailment by the time medicine runs out \u2014 leave thousands bereft of pain relief, and thus, tempted to turn to illegal avenues to do so. Of course, the pharmaceutical industry has been profiting handily from the uptick in legal opioids \u2014 that uptick incidentally coincided with an astronomical surge in opium production in Afghanistan, where the supply had been all-but eradicated prior to the U.S. military invasion in 2003. But, whatever complex web of societal and world issues created the current opioid crisis, these studies \u2014 and a potential looming capitulation from the federal government \u2014 prove cannabis holds promise in reducing dependence, if not stamping out the epidemic, altogether. Although the authors of this and other studies have yet to state as much, the irony of cannabis \u2014 a plant \u2014 occupying the same rung on the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s blacklist of substances not meriting any medical value cannot be emphasized sufficiently. However, if the definitive switch in stance from the National Institute on Drug Abuse can be a positive portent for the near future, it\u2019s entirely possible politicians and policymakers have finally \u2014 at long last \u2014 come to their senses on the seeming innumerable benefits of cannabis. Ending cannabis prohibition \u2014 and the entire drug war \u2014 would do more to help those addicted to Big Pharma\u2019s opioids than any disingenuous moralizing about \u2018drugs\u2019 ever could.",

        "title":"After Years of Protesting Trump\\'s Policy, Left Silent as Biden INCREASES Funding for ICE",
        "link":"https:\/\/thefreethoughtproject.com\/cop-watch\/after-years-of-protesting-trumps-policy-left-silent-as-biden-increases-funding-for-ice",
        "text":"One day after Joseph Robinette Biden was sworn in as President, TFTP predicted that he would continue the most destructive policies of the Trump administration. We predicted he would bolster the police state \u2014 he did. We predicted he would continue the wars and expand the military industrial complex \u2014 he has. And, we predicted that he would not end the program of \"kids in cages\" and defund ICE \u2014 he has not \u2014 and in fact, he is increasing their funding. For people outraged by Trump putting \u201ckids in cages\u201d as part of his crackdown on illegal immigration, Joe Biden is not different. Remember, he was vice president during the Obama administration which aggressively deported more immigrants than Trump and who also put \u201ckids in cages.\" In fact, the photos used to first bring attention to kids in cages under Trump, were actually taken during Biden's tenure as VP. Biden's cheerleading team in the mainstream media has been insultingly silent as the kids in cages program has continued under his tenure. As Republicans blame the lack of a wall, they completely ignore the fact that not only is Biden continuing Trump's immigration policy \u2014 he is spending more on it. As Reason points out: Biden's budget proposal calls for appropriating more than $7.99billion in discretionary funding to ICE during the fiscal year that begins on October 1. That's about $18 million higher than what Congress authorized for the current fiscal year. If implemented as proposed, Biden's budget would see the federal government spend more on ICE than it did during three of former President Donald Trump's four years in office\u2014and it represents a 23 percent increase over the final budget overseen by former President Barack Obama. In short, Biden's budget locks in the Trump-era surge in funding for ICE\u2014a surge that caused significant outrage on the political left, as the protesters at Biden's April speech evince. According to the report, the increase in budget would serve to hire 100 more attorneys and staffers to \"address the backlog of immigration cases.\" As Reason points out, however, the number of ICE agents in \"Enforcement and Removal Operations,\" still make up the largest portion of the entire agencies budget. Not surprisingly, the establishment right is still playing their role in demonizing Biden for \"defunding ICE\" or \"abolishing ICE\" when he is doing the exact opposite. This move by the Biden administration to use smoke and mirrors to convince his base that change is happening is not uncommon. In fact, as we reported earlier this year, though he stopped construction of Trump's easily scalable border wall, his administration is planning something far worse. Earlier this year, TFTP reported on how Joe Biden picked up where Donald Trump left off in regard to the border wall. While he doesn't plan on constructing a physical wall, Biden's plan is far more sinister and will deploy AI technology to create a \"smart wall\" akin to something out of a dystopian science fiction movie. The smart wall will not be as obvious and physically offensive as an actual wall, but aerial drones, infrared cameras, motion sensors, radar, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence is far more ominous than steal and bricks. According to the Nation: These implements have the veneer of scientific impartiality and rarely produce contentious imagery, which makes them both palatable to a broadly apathetic public and insidiously dangerous. Unlike a border wall, an advanced virtual \u201cborder\u201d doesn\u2019t just exist along the demarcation dividing countries. It extends hundreds of miles inland along the \u201cConstitution-free zone\u201d of enhanced Border Patrol authority. It\u2019s in private property and along domestic roadways. It\u2019s at airports, where the government is ready to roll out a facial recognition system with no age limit that includes travelers on domestic flights that never cross a border. A frontline Customs and Border Protection officer, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly, told The Nation that they had concerns about the growth of this technology, especially with the agency \u201cexpanding its capabilities and training its armed personnel to act as a federal police.\u201d These capabilities were showcased this summer when CBP agents joined other often-unidentified federal forces in cities with Black Lives Matter protests. The deployments included the use of ground and aerial surveillance tech, including drones, as first reported by The Nation. This sort of mission creep illustrates the folly in complacency over the use of advanced surveillance tech on the grounds that it is for \u201cborder enforcement.\u201d It is always easier to add to the list of acceptable data uses than it is to limit them, largely owing to our security paranoia where any risk is unacceptable. One of the most minacious aspects of this smart wall is that it will extend the police and surveillance state tactics used at airports \u2014 around the entire country. Imagine you are checking into a flight at an airport, excited to go on vacation but when you attempt to get your ticket, you are told you cannot fly. Suddenly, you are surrounded by security and hauled off for questioning. You have committed no crime and you have no recourse to ask why you cannot fly. This happens every day in this country as Homeland Security enforces the unconstitutional No Fly List. But fret not woke liberals, under Biden's plan, kids will be put in cages by folks wearing LGBTQ arm bands and using proper pronouns thereby correcting the horrible policy Trump carried out for years.",

The international pandemic response has generally been perceived as a total disaster and a complete chaos. Yet this is only true if seen from a public health perspective. If seen from a technological and strategic perspective, the response may be described as an unprecedented success. Within months of the WHO pandemic declaration in March 2020, PCR genetic tests became widely available, Apple and Google inserted contact tracing interfaces into the operating systems of billions of mobile phones, and numerous governments had developed contact tracing apps. Within less than a year, novel \u201cprogrammable\u201d mRNA vaccines became available internationally. And in March 2021, Israel was the first country to introduce a digital vaccination certificate (\u201cGreen Pass\u201d), followed by almost every other country in the world, including no-lockdown Sweden. Throughout this time, digital technologies were leveraged to manage remote work, remote learning and lockdowns, enforced in some places by the use of modern police drones and robotic dogs. None of these innovations worked to contain or stop the pandemic, and none of them had been recommended by existing pandemic guidelines. Yet most of these policies were recommended by billionaire-funded organizations such as CEPI and GAVI, and many of them were publicly announced in March 2020 by the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful doctor\u201d (Politico), Bill Gates, a major sponsor of the World Health Organization and a leading investor in mRNA vaccine technology. Furthermore, most of these innovations tie in neatly with other strategic initiatives, such as the WEF-linked ID2020 digital identity program, or they might be repurposed later on in the context of \u201cclimate change policy\u201d, \u201cterrorism prevention\u201d, or Chinese-style \u201csocial credit\u201d population control systems. In this regard, Israeli military historian and \u201cWEF philosopher\u201d, Yuval Harari, argued already in October 2020 that \u201cCovid is critical, because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize total biometric surveillance.\u201d It is also noteworthy that while lockdowns, face masks and covid vaccines totally failed to stop coronavirus transmission, the false idea that they could stop transmission was crucial to justifying the introduction of QR-based digital vaccination certificates in the first place. The EU recently decided to extend the legal basis of these certificates for another year, while the US is about to fire 60,000 unvaccinated National Guard and reserve soldiers. In February, the WHO tasked Deutsche Telekom with building a global QR-based vaccine passport system. Read more: Did CEPI\u2019s bio-spooks lock down the West? (TCW) and Cock-up or Conspiracy? Understanding COVID-19 as a \u2018Structural Deep Event\u2019 (Dr. Piers Robinson) The Dubious SARS\/MERS \u201cDeath Rate\u201d A quite important yet mostly overlooked aspect of covid fearmongering was the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS and MERS. Specifically, the media and many scientists repeatedly stated that SARS had a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of 10% and MERS had a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of 35%, which made it seemingly reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-like coronavirus, might also have a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of at least several percent and might kill hundreds of millions of people, or even a third of mankind. Yet a quick review of these \u201cdeath rates\u201d shows that these are not, of course, infection fatality rates, but case fatality rates, and the \u201ccases\u201d were not just any cases, but mostly patients hospitalized with a severe case of SARS or MERS. This is because during both the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 and the MERS outbreak in 2012-2015, there was not yet any PCR mass testing available, and only severe cases were tested at all. Thus, it is quite likely that the original SARS and MERS outbreaks were in fact larger than recorded, and the SARS and MERS infection fatality rates in the general population were much lower, perhaps only a fraction of one percent, similar to the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2. Ironically, if the recent pandemic had been caused by an aggressive influenza virus instead of a coronavirus, the actual death rate, especially in young people, could have been much higher. See also: Covid fatality rates (SPR) China and Zero Covid China is the last country on Earth to still pursue a hopeless \u201czero covid\u201d policy, and Chinese authorities continue to impose devastating lockdowns on major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Various theories have been proposed as to why China would follow such a seemingly irrational and destructive policy, including \u201cChina is deceiving the West\u201d, \u201cChina is putting health over profits\u201d, or \u201cChina deliberately disrupts Western supply chains\u201d. Yet most likely, the Chinese government simply doesn\u2019t want to admit defeat against coronavirus. Furthermore, the fact that the US suffered one million covid deaths and India suffered three to five million covid deaths, while China until 2022 had suffered very few covid deaths, is seen as confirmation that China is in fact a superior civilization. The Chinese government is also perhaps the most technocratic government in the world, and they are the only government that has even tried to preempt or disrupt aerosol transmission, which comes at an enormous economic and social cost. Finally, the Chinese government likely sees covid as an opportunity to further enhance its QR-based population control scheme. Remarkably, though, Beijing city authorities recently had to withdraw a planned vaccination mandate for some public venues after massive online protest by citizens. To get a glimpse of the Chinese \u201czero covid\u201d reality, see the eye-opening Twitter video channel of \u201cSongpinganq\u201d (16+, contains disturbing footage). To learn more about the Chinese digital \u201csocial credit\u201d system, see this 5-minute report by France24. See also: Did China stage the early covid videos? (SPR) Coronavirus Origins As previously discussed, the novel coronavirus almost certainly emerged out of US-Chinese virological research. Moreover, the current omicron variant, which features two dozen immune-evasive spike mutations \u201ccopied from scientific publications\u201d, most likely emerged from pan-coronavirus vaccine research (presumably in a South African lab). Thus, within the span of just three years, the world has likely seen not one, but two man-made virus pandemics. After the delta variant, several countries with covid infection rates above 70% had achieved a kind of \u201cherd immunity\u201d and had seen the return of influenza viruses (e.g. India, Brazil and Sweden); yet the immune-evasive (but milder) omicron variant has undone this achievement and has launched several massive new waves within just a few months. Most recently, the Chair of the Lancet Covid Commission, US professor Jeffrey Sachs, stated that he is \u201cpretty convinced [SARS-CoV-2] came out of US lab biotechnology, not out of nature\u201d and that this is \u201cnot being investigated, not in the United States and not anywhere, for real reasons\u2026 I believe they do not want to look under the rug too much.\u201d Professor Sachs also wrote an in-depth article and a scientific paper on the likely origins of SARS-CoV-2. A lab-related virus origin either in China or in the US, and either accidental or deliberate \u2013 all of these possibilities remain entirely plausible. In particular, a deliberate release does not even have to be a \u201cconspiracy\u201d, as any single researcher involved in this type of research could decide to release such a pathogen, as the US FBI (falsely) claimed in the case of the 2001 anthrax letters. See also: On the Origins of SARS-CoV-2 (SPR) Why Face Masks Have Failed It has been known for decades that face masks don\u2019t work against respiratory virus epidemics, and the current coronavirus pandemic has once again confirmed this reality. Even N95\/FFP2 masks have had no impact on infection rates in the general population, neither in Germany and Austria, nor in Taiwan and South Korea (which saw record infection rates in recent months). A recent Australian study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has finally shown why face masks fail so badly. The experimental study for the first time used actual virus aerosols (of a virus harmless to humans) and actual human participants (not puppet heads) in an aerosol chamber. The study found that neither face masks nor unfitted N95 masks had any measurable effect on virus loads in the nostrils of study participants (fig. 2B); only fit-tested N95 masks significantly and strongly reduced virus loads in nostrils, as they prevent aerosols from bypassing the mask. This result is fully consistent with real-world observations that face masks and N95 masks worn by the general population are useless, whereas fit-tested N95 masks worn by medical professionals can make a real difference \u2013 although during an epidemic, medical professionals may then get infected at home or during social activities, as masks cannot be worn 24\/7. See also: The Face Mask Folly in Retrospect (SPR) The Dark Side of Covid Vaccine Trials How sincere were the original covid vaccine trials? It was already known that the Russian Sputnik vaccine trial most likely forged its results (to achieve an efficacy at least as high as Western mRNA vaccines). It was also known that both AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson declared some severe adverse events that were likely related to the vaccine \u2013 a case of transverse myelitis and a case of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis \u2013 as being \u201cunrelated\u201d. Furthermore, it was known that the Pfizer vaccine trial had strangely excluded, without explanation, five times more people from the vaccine group than from the control group. Pfizer and the US FDA attempted to hide the original Pfizer vaccine trial documents for a full 75 years, but a determined New York lawyer forced them to immediately release the documents on a monthly basis. While almost totally ignored by traditional media, many of these documents have since been analyzed by independent investigators who coordinate themselves on Twitter. Their preliminary results indicate that Pfizer and its subcontractors (which ran the trial sites) really may have suppressed some serious vaccine adverse events (by excluding the participants or by miscategorizing the events) and may have exaggerated vaccine efficacy to some extent (by not testing symptomatic participants or by simply excluding positive participants). There have also been claims that hidden anti-N antibody data showed that the Pfizer vaccine actually had zero efficacy, but this was not the case: most of these infections occurred prior to the second vaccine dose or shortly thereafter. To learn more about the dark side of the Pfizer vaccine trial, take a look at the following articles: The covid vaccines may have saved a few million lives in 2021, mainly by mitigating the alpha and delta waves in Europe, the United States and elsewhere (though not \u201c20 million lives\u201d as recently claimed by some Gates-funded researchers). But vaccine protection even against severe disease is rapidly waning: the Netherlands recently reported 75% protection after four doses weeks ago, 60% protection after three doses months ago, and 0% protection after two doses a year ago. Overall, covid vaccines may yet win a Nobel Prize in Medicine, or turn out to be the biggest medical scandal in recent history, or perhaps both. At any rate, the vaccination of people not at risk of severe acute covid was almost certainly a mistake, and in some cases a crime. See also: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events (SPR) Covid Drugs I: The Failure of Antivirals To treat covid, pharmaceutical companies mostly focused on the development of novel and rather expensive antiviral drugs. Yet all of these drugs, sold for billions of dollars to desperate health authorities, ultimately failed. Antiviral drugs that were given only to hospitalized patients with severe covid had to fail almost by definition, as most of these patients had already progressed to the post-viral, hyper-inflammatory phase of covid. This was the case of convalescent plasma therapy and Gilead\u2019s highly expensive yet toxic and totally ineffective Remdesivir. Monoclonal antibodies, which were given to high-risk outpatients as quickly as possible, initially proved effective, but they lost the battle against new coronavirus mutations. Merck\u2019s Molnupiravir was a non-starter, both ineffective against most variants and dangerously mutagenic (\u201cavoid unprotected sex for 30 days after treatment\u201d). Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid, which directly inhibits the main coronavirus replication enzyme, looked most promising. Yet it soon turned out that it was effective only in unvaccinated high-risk patients, not in standard-risk patients or in vaccinated high-risk patients. Moreover, up to half of all patients experienced a \u201ccovid rebound\u201d immediately after discontinuing the drug; the side effect profile was worse than expected (\u201cPaxlovid mouth\u201d); and SARS-CoV-2 quickly started developing Paxlovid-resistant mutations. Another expensive bummer. SPR had warned in advance that Remdesivir was a fraud, Molnupiravir was outright dangerous, and Paxlovid might lead to rapid reinfections. The reality is that antiviral drugs may simply not be the ideal choice against a ubiquitous and fast-mutating respiratory virus. Covid Drugs II: Ivermectin, HCQ, and more Given the many issues with antiviral drugs, another approach to tackle covid is to try to improve the immune response and to mitigate the health impact of the virus. At the population level, this could be done by reducing obesity rates, since obesity has been shown to be linked to an ineffective and even destructive immune response. It could also be done by removing any deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (e.g. vitamin D and zinc). Two of the most controversial covid treatments during the pandemic have been Nobel Prize-winning anti-parasitic drug ivermectin and history-making anti-malaria drug HCQ. Most trials of these and other off-patent drugs were rather pointless, involving low-risk participants, late administration, or unrealistic endpoints (e.g. infections or symptom duration instead of disease progression). Nevertheless, concerning ivermectin, a yet unpublished, updated meta-analysis of non-fraudulent trials indicates that ivermectin is indeed about 30% effective at reducing severe and fatal covid. Furthermore, the lead investigator of the TOGETHER trial acknowledged in a leaked email that \u201cthere is a clear signal that ivermectin works in COVID patients\u201d. The renowned French Institute Pasteur previously found a \u201cmore favorable clinical presentation\u201d in a detailed coronavirus animal study. The apparent usefulness of ivermectin is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, but due to the known immuno-modulatory and anti-asthma effects. This would also explain why Merck, in early 2021, claimed ivermectin was \u201cnot effective\u201d: if anything, they only looked into anti-viral activity. Concerning HCQ, an updated retrospective study from the group of French professor Didier Raoult found a 30% effectiveness against death in hospitalized patients, and a similar or higher effectiveness in outpatients. A yet-to-be-published meta-analysis also found a 30% effectiveness against hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients. In the case of HCQ, the apparent usefulness is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, either, but instead due to the known anti-coagulation and anti-autoimmune effects. In sum, it looks like some of these medications could really have been beneficial in reducing the risk of severe covid, but they clearly did not \u201ccrush the curve\u201d anywhere. See also: On the treatment of covid (SPR) Asymptomatic Transmission: A Myth? Many authorities tried to use the idea of \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d to justify mask mandates and lockdowns, while many skeptics pushed back by arguing that \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d was a myth. In truth, asymptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic transmission are real and well-known from influenza and other viruses, but due to aerosol transmission, face masks and other restrictions still don\u2019t work. Some recent press reports claimed that a new meta-study showed \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d was very rare, but the meta-study in fact showed the opposite: it found that pre-symptomatic transmission was just as likely as symptomatic transmission (risk ratio 1.00) and that it accounted for 30% to 50% of all transmission. Only people that remain fully asymptomatic throughout their infection are less likely to infect others (risk ratio 0.32), likely because of a lower viral load. Indeed, without insidious pre-symptomatic aerosol transmission \u2013 which doesn\u2019t require any \u201cdroplets\u201d produced by coughing or sneezing \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic would probably not have been possible. Given that aerosol transmission occurs almost only indoors and face masks are ineffective against aerosols, public health policy should likely focus on improving indoor air quality, especially in important public venues. See also: Pre-symptomatic transmission is very real (SPR) Long Covid: Another Myth? Similar to the case of \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d, many health authorities tried to use the risk of \u201clong covid\u201d to justify mask mandates or vaccination mandates even for young people, while many skeptics tried to push back by arguing that \u201clong covid\u201d was a myth or a psychological condition. Yet ever since the summer of 2020, the clinical reality of long covid has been obvious, and it has also been clear that long covid can seriously impact the quality of life and performance even of previously healthy young people who had only seemingly mild covid. The pathology of long covid isn\u2019t a total mystery anymore, either. First, there are patients who do not (fully) recover their sense of taste or smell. Second, there are patients who show respiratory problems due to asthma-like conditions, gas exchange abnormalities, or lung perfusion (blood flow) issues (presumably due to endothelial damage). Third, there are patients who develop new-onset neurological or auto-immune conditions that are often difficult to diagnose. On the other hand, heart inflammation is not generally a covid or long covid risk, but rather a covid vaccination risk, especially in young males. Studies that claim \u201clong covid\u201d is a myth typically make one of three mistakes: first, they compare non-specific symptoms unrelated to covid and long covid; second, they rely on unreliable antibody data; or third, they assume that if a general practitioner cannot identify a cause, no cause exists. In this regard, a study recently published in Lancet eBioMedicine found that almost 50% of long covid patients that showed no SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did show a SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response (i.e. they had been infected). It is also known that some widely used antibody tests (e.g. Abbott) have a sensitivity of just 20% one year after mild infection. The real questions concerning long covid are rather these: how many people are affected, how severe are these cases, what is the recovery rate, do reinfections increase the risk of long covid or exacerbate long covid, and are there any treatments? For instance, a recent German insurance study found that among covid patients in 2020, 1% to 5% received a medical long covid diagnosis in 2021; the average long covid sick leave from work in 2021 was 90 days even in non-hospitalized patients, and 105 days overall. Denying long covid is about as reasonable as denying vaccine injuries. It is part of the complex reality of this pandemic, unfortunately, even though the condition has indeed in some cases been abused for fearmongering and political ends. Read more: Post-Acute Covid and Long Covid (SPR) Children: Little Heroes or Big Losers? A comprehensive Icelandic study recently confirmed once more that covid remained asymptomatic or mild in almost all children, and that prior to omicron, almost 90% of infections in children occurred outside of school, mostly at home, and mostly from adults to children, not the other way around (omicron removed this difference to some extent). On the other hand, UNESCO found that over 150 million children missed more than half a year of in-person schooling (and up to two years in some countries), which caused reading and math abilities to decline substantially, especially in developing countries. According to the World Bank, the pandemic response has caused \u201cthe worst educational crisis for a century, and certainly since the world wars.\u201d Children should have been the little invincible heroes of this pandemic, but unfortunately in many countries they have been turned into perhaps the biggest losers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this pandemic, it is to never repeat this mistake. See also: Covid and Kids: The Evidence. (SPR) You have been reading: Secrets of the Pandemic.

        "text":"Published: June 2022 Share on: TW \/ FB \/ TG Magic potion or snake oil? An honest look at the international data. Abstract Prior to the omicron variant, covid vaccine protection against infection decreased from 95% to 0% and protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens decreased from 95% to 50% within about half a year. Since omicron, which is both milder and more infectious, vaccine protection against infection decreases from 60% to 0% and protection against severe disease in senior citizens decreases from at most 80% to less than 50% within a few months. There is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection. Thus, while the risk\/benefit ratio appears to remain positive in senior citizens and other covid risk groups, this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children, as vaccine adverse events remain an issue. Finally, both \u201cvaccine passports\u201d and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned. Introduction: Different positions towards covid vaccines There are three different, fundamental positions towards covid vaccines than can be distinguished: Positive\/promotional: This is the position taken by vaccine manufacturers, many politicians and many (but not all) health agencies. It is typically driven by commercial or political considerations. In addition, many scientists who depend on government or industry money or who want to publish in high-impact journals have also taken a promotional position. Negative\/adverse: This is the position taken by vaccine skeptics. An adverse position can be based on various considerations, such as: 1) a fundamental rejection of vaccines in general; 2) a rejection of covid vaccines in particular, e.g. due to their novel technology and\/or limited trial data; 3) a rejection of vaccines produced by companies with no track record (Moderna, Biontech) or with a criminal track record (Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson, AstraZeneca); 4) or based on strategic considerations (e.g. \u2018vaccine passports\u2019 as potential tools of population control). Neutral \/ skeptical but open-minded: This is the position taken by some independent investigators and research groups, including Swiss Policy Research. This group of analysts tries to obtain and provide as comprehensive and as nuanced a picture as possible on both vaccine effectiveness and vaccine safety, as well as on strategic considerations. Different aspects of vaccine protection In the following analysis, we will distinguish between protection against (symptomatic) infection and protection against severe disease (hospitalization, ICU, death). Furthermore, we will distinguish between the pre-omicron period and the omicron period, and between senior citizens and non-senior citizens. Unless otherwise stated, protection refers to mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) and is expressed in relative percentage terms. Protection against infection Prior to omicron (i.e. during the alpha and delta periods), several large studies showed that vaccine protection against symptomatic infection decreased from about 90%\/95% shortly after vaccination to close to 0% within about half a year (Lancet). This decrease was first seen in Israel during the delta wave in summer 2021 (SPR). There have been claims that vaccine protection \u201cturns negative\u201d at some point beyond half a year. However, based on the currently available data, it looks like vaccinated people, who enjoyed a lower infection rate for about half a year, are simply \u201ccatching up\u201d with unvaccinated people, but their infection risk is not actually higher than in unvaccinated people without prior infection (which would require some kind of immune suppression). This analysis is backed by the fact that a \u201cbooster vaccination\u201d restores protection against infection to the initial level, but again only for a short period of time (Lancet). Since omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50%-60% shortly after vaccination and decreases to 0% within 4 to 6 months. A booster vaccination restores protection to 50%-60%, but again only for a short period of time. (NEJM) The lower peak protection is due to the partial immune escape of the omicron variant. In contrast to vaccine protection, a previous covid infection confers a more durable protection against re-infection (\u201cnatural immunity\u201d). Prior to omicron, a previous covid infection provided 75% to 90% protection against re-infection for over a year, with only a slight decline (JAMA). Since omicron, a non-omicron infection 4 to 12 months earlier still provides a protection of 70% to 50% against re-infection with omicron, according to a study from Qatar (Lancet). According to a study from Denmark, which included more older people, protection decreased from 50% to 20% for a previous infection 6 months to 12+ months ago (Lancet). Furthermore, it has been shown that viral load and infectiousness are identical in unvaccinated and in vaccinated people (once infection occurs) (medRxiv). In addition, there is no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid (once infection occurs), contrary to countless claims on Twitter (\u201cgrateful to be vaccinated and boosted\u201d). In other words, covid vaccination cannot prevent mild to moderate covid infection. There is also no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens (Nature). Concerning negative vaccine protection, there is one important exception: for about 7 to 10 days immediately after vaccination \u2013 especially after the first vaccination and apparently also after a later \u201cbooster vaccination\u201d \u2013 the risk of infection is indeed increased, possibly due to the known, transient immune suppression (lymphocytopenia) and increased exposure (\u201cpost-vaccination spike\u201d). This effect is important because it looks like in several countries, mass vaccination campaigns have indeed triggered new covid waves or amplified ongoing covid waves (if the vaccination campaign was running in parallel to such a wave, e.g. in Israel). In sum, the fact that current covid vaccines provide only short-term, rapidly waning protection against infection and transmission means that covid vaccines do not contribute to infection control, neither at the individual level nor at the population level. However, contrary to claims by skeptics, there is also currently no evidence that vaccination increases infection rates (with the exception of the post-vaccination spike mentioned above). Rather, covid waves, similar to flu waves, oscillate at global and continental scales (e.g. between Western and Eastern Europe). The fact that vaccine protection against infection and transmission is waning rapidly means that so-called \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are epidemiologically inappropriate or indeed counter\u00adproductive. For the same reason, vaccine mandates, even in healthcare workers, are medically unjustified. Based on Israeli data from early summer 2021, these facts had already been known before most countries even introduced such schemes. Nevertheless, covid vaccines may provide protection against severe disease and death in high-risk groups. This question will be discussed in the next section. Protection against severe disease and death Prior to omicron, vaccine protection against severe disease in senior citizens (hospitalization, ICU and death) decreased from about 95% to about 60% within half a year (Lancet). It was this decrease that triggered the first booster campaigns, beginning in Israel in the summer of 2021. In younger people, the protection was somewhat more durable (about 80% after half a year) (Lancet). The omicron variant has achieved substantial immune escape, and neutralization power of existing vaccines, which are still based on the spike protein of the original 2019 Wuhan variant, decreased by a factor of 10 to 50 compared to previous variants (SPR). Initially, it was uncertain if current vaccines would still provide any protection against omicron infection and severe disease. Nevertheless, an analysis from Taiwan, which had almost no covid infections before experiencing a massive omicron wave in the spring of 2022, shows that in senior citizens (70+), a recent booster vaccination provides about 75% to 80% protection against covid death; in contrast, double vaccination (several months ago) provides only about 40% protection against death (TCDC). Similarly, a British study on the risk of omicron hospitalization found that double vaccination months ago provided about 40% protection and a recent booster about 60% to 80% protection (Lancet). Clearly, the decisive point here is not the number of vaccinations, but rather the time since the last vaccination (as is the case with flu vaccination). A recent study from Qatar found higher values: two doses several months ago provided about 75% protection against severe disease or death, whereas a booster a few weeks ago provided about 90% protection. However, in the Qatar study, only 2% of participants were over 70 years of age, i.e. these results are not directly applicable to Western or Asian populations. (NEJM) Thus, it looks like against omicron, vaccination several months ago reduces the risk of severe disease by about 50%, while recent vaccination may reduce the risk by about 75% (in senior citizens). It is possible that this continuing protection is due to a combination of limited levels of neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and the T-cell response (NIH). In comparison, natural immunity from a previous infection (without any vaccination) provides more durable protection against severe disease upon reinfection. Prior to omicron, studies found a protection against hospitalization of about 90% for over a year with no declining trend (JAMA). Against omicron, the Qatar study, which included mostly young people, found a protection of 75% to 95% (NEJM). The important question of how strongly a previous (non-omicron) infection protects against severe omicron disease in senior citizens has not yet been answered. Concerning vaccine protection against severe disease, the decreasing immune response with age (so-called immunosenescence) is of importance. Most vaccine studies did not include very old citizens (80+) or nursing home residents, despite the fact that these are the groups most at risk of severe covid. Already in early 2021, studies showed that one third of people over 80 did not develop any neutralizing antibodies in response to covid vaccination, and that in nursing home residents, vaccine protection against infection reached at most 65%. (SPR) This fact is important when analyzing country-level data, as will be done in the next section. Update: Official Dutch data shows that against severe disease caused by omicron, two vaccine doses (a year earlier) provide 0% protection, three doses 63%, and four doses 77%. New data from Qatar shows that even in people over 50, a previous infection provides 95% protection against severe disease upon reinfection with omicron for more than a year. Country analyses Vaccine study data reviewed above suggested that since omicron, protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months. Are these values consistent with what has been observed in various Western and Asian countries? The analysis of vaccine protection against omicron is complicated by the fact that in terms of hospitalizations and deaths, the omicron variant itself is about 60% to 80% milder compared to previous variants (Lancet). Furthermore, the mildness and very rapid spread of omicron means that 50% to 70% of PCR+ hospitalizations and deaths are just \u201cwith covid\u201d, not \u201cfrom covid\u201d, compared to about 10% to 20% during previous covid waves (SSI). Finally, the fact that many people already had a previous covid infection further adds to the complexity of calculating vaccine protection. Even excess mortality data can be difficult to interpret. This is because of pandemic and lockdown-related non-covid deaths (e.g. from cancer and heart disease); a return of strong flu waves in several countries; potential vaccine deaths; and seasonal factors (e.g. an out-of-season covid wave causes higher relative excess mortality than a seasonal wave). Nevertheless, it is worth taking a look at real-world data from some notable countries. Switzerland: Switzerland is an interesting case because it is the only country that has been using mainly the high-dosed Moderna vaccine (40% Moderna, 25% Pfizer, 30% unvaccinated). Swiss authorities provide detailed covid hospitalization and death data per age group and vaccination status (BAG, in English). Thus, one can see that during the two omicron waves in January and March 2022, double-vaccination provided still about 60% protection and recent booster vaccination provided about 90% to 80% protection against severe disease in senior citizens. Furthermore, Moderna provided consistently higher protection compared to Pfizer. Hong Kong: Hong Kong is another fascinating case, as it had almost no infections for two years but then experienced a record-breaking omicron wave in February\/March 2022 with very high covid death figures. At first glance this looked like total vaccine failure, but a closer inspection showed that vaccination rates in senior citizens were only 30% to 50%; 60% of deaths occurred in nursing homes; 90% of deaths were not yet double-vaccinated; and excess mortality was only about 65% of covid mortality (i.e. a third of PCR+ deaths weren\u2019t actually covid deaths). A comparison with Taiwan (80% booster rate in senior citizens (TCDC)) shows that the omicron wave in Taiwan reached about 40% of peak infections, but only 20% of peak deaths compared to Hong Kong (OWD). Thus, the case of Hong Kong does not contradict vaccine protection. Australia: Due to strict border controls, Australia largely avoided pre-omicron infection waves, but the country has experienced several large omicron waves from January to June 2022. Compared to Hong Kong, total cases stand at 200%, but total deaths stand at only 30% (despite a much higher obesity rate in Australia); compared to the UK, total Australian PCR cases currently stand at 90%, but total PCR+ deaths stand at only 15% (per capita) (OWD). Thus, Australian data, too, appears to be consistent with continuing vaccine protection in senior citizens. Israel: Covid vaccination pioneer Israel is the only European country that suffered higher excess mortality during the first omicron wave than during previous waves (EuroMomo). Nevertheless, official Israeli data shows that during the omicron wave, recently vaccinated senior citizens (3rd or 4th dose) had a 90% lower risk of severe disease, and senior citizens vaccinated a few months ago still had a 50% lower risk compared to unvaccinated citizens (IMH). The Israeli omicron wave was ten times higher than any previous wave in Israel, and it was higher even than the omicron wave in Hong Kong one month later (OWD). It is possible that the Israeli wave was so explosive because Israel once again vaccinated right into an ongoing wave. In conclusion, one can see that real-world data from several countries are consistent with a short-term vaccine protection against severe disease in the range of 50% to 90%. Nevertheless, even highly vaccinated populations continue to see non-trivial levels of covid disease. This is likely because of several factors: first, vaccination simply cannot limit transmission; second, vaccine protection against severe disease is typically only twofold to five-fold (50% to 80%) and not twenty-fold (95%); and third, omicron, although milder, has produced unprecedented infection rates (ten times higher than during previous waves). Updated vaccines and antigenic priming Will updated omicron vaccines improve protection against omicron infection and disease? It looks like this is not going to be the case, as prior vaccination or prior infection has \u201cprimed\u201d the immune response to the pre-omicron virus or spike protein, and an updated vaccine can no longer significantly change the immune response (so-called antigenic priming) (Nature). Moderna recently reported that its updated omicron vaccine increased neutralizing antibodies against omicron by a factor of 8, but a factor of 8 is very low (not even one order of magnitude), especially since the baseline was very low already, and it only applies to people without any prior infection, which by now is a small minority (Moderna). It has also been shown that vaccinated people, once infected, often produce antibodies only against the spike (S) protein (as induced by the vaccine), but not against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the virus, in contrast to unvaccinated people (NIH). The significance of this limited immune response in vaccinated people is not yet clear, as anti-N antibodies are not neutralizing antibodies, and children often do not produce anti-N antibodies, either (Nature). Anti-N antibodies could be beneficial, irrelevant, or even detrimental against future variants and infections. In sum, it looks like SARS-CoV-2 antigenic priming now is a reality, both in vaccinated and in previously infected people, and current vaccine products are unlikely to significantly improve their effectiveness against future variants. On the other hand, there is still no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of covid infection or disease. Rapidly declining effectiveness is not unique to covid vaccines; rather, it is a phenomenon already known from influenza vaccines (CID). Indeed, it looks like injecting specific antigens is simply not an ideal long-term strategy in the fight against quickly mutating respiratory viruses. Distorting vaccine protection Vaccine protection can be exaggerated (by vaccine promoters) or downplayed (by vaccine skeptics). Typical methods to exaggerate vaccine protection are: 1) not counting infections shortly after vaccination (\u201cvaccinated\u201d vs. \u201cinjected\u201d); 2) counting patients with missing vaccination data as \u201cunvaccinated\u201d; 3) using outdated population data to exaggerate infections and hospitalizations in the unvaccinated; 4) quoting peak protection without acknowledging the rapid decline. Typical methods to downplay vaccine protection are: 1) Ignoring infection rates when comparing death rates; 2) confounding age groups; 3) comparing vaccinated to recovered people instead of unexposed people (\u201cnegative protection\u201d); 4) not distinguishing between with\/from covid (especially since omicron). Vaccine skeptics have correctly pointed out that in addition to relative effectiveness, one should also consider absolute effectiveness, which strongly depends on age. For instance, a 90% relative effectiveness translates into an absolute reduction of pre-omicron covid lethality from 1% to 0.1% (i.e. \u20130.9%) in senior citizens (outside of nursing homes) and from 0.05% to 0.005% in 45-year-old people (i.e. \u20130.045%) (SPR). Vaccine injuries While the current review has focused on vaccine protection only, it should be recalled that covid vaccines are first-generation investigational vaccines with controversial short-term safety data, especially in young people, and still unknown long-term safety data. Indeed, in several countries authorization of some covid vaccine brands has already been denied, withdrawn, or limited to certain age groups due to significant safety signals. Serious vaccine adverse events include cardiovascular, neurological and immunological conditions. Additional booster vaccinations could further increase covid vaccine adverse events. Read more: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events: An Overview (SPR) Conclusion Both vaccine study data and real-world data reviewed above suggest that since omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months. Furthermore, there is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection. Thus, while the risk\/benefit ratio may still be positive in senior citizens and other risk groups (based on current evidence), this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children. Danish professor in global health and vaccine expert, Dr. Christine Stabell-Benn, recently stated that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t recommend vaccination of anybody under 50 years of age.\u201d Finally, both \u201cvaccine passports\u201d and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned.

But first I\u2019d like you to focus on just where this massive peak of unvaccinated deaths occurs. What do you notice? Shock horror! It\u2019s in the peak of winter when mortality is always at its highest and, wait for it, at a time when less than 5% of the population were vaccinated. From march onwards, the numbers decline as the unvaccinated proportion of the population decreases and winter subsides into summer. In fact, the vaccinated begin to rise above the unvaccinated. But undeniably, yes, the double jabbed death rate does appear to be significantly lower from COVID-19 related deaths. But here\u2019s the thing, there have been more deaths following vaccination reported via the UK\u2019s vaccine injury reporting system since the middle of March through to the beginning of March than there has of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated in the same timeframe.

        "text":"These include heavier than usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after all three Covid vaccines, out of more than 47 million doses given to women in the UK to date.- BBC News[1] Did you notice the misleading data included in that statement? \u201947 million doses given to women in the UK to date\u2019 \u2013 So what are we discussing here, menstrual cycles. Right, so how many of this 47 million doses were given to post-menopausal women. Well, we have around 12.5 million women between the ages of 20 and 50. I\u2019ve used this age range because young women commonly have menstrual cycle issues due to developing hormones, birth control and lifestyle and 50 is the average age of menopause. This brings the number down to around 12 million. Now we have to reduce this further based on vaccination status. This is more tricky to determine if we are to believe the commonly touted percentage of 80% this brings the amount down to 9.6 million. Early menopause occurs in amount 5% of women under 45[2], so we can reduce this number to 9.1 million. Polycystic ovaries effects 10% of the population[3] and so this brings the number down further to around 8.2 million. Of course, we can reduce this number further if we had the data, but since this is quite a crude calculation anyway, we\u2019ll leave it there in \u2018their\u2019 favour. Now consider the fact that 30,000 reports do not equate to 30,000 actual incidences of menstrual irregularity. As you well know, studies on the VAERs reporting system found that as little as 1% of adverse events were reported. When it comes to menstrual irregularities, this number could be even less considering the perceived seriousness of it. But for argument\u2019s sake let us assume 5% have been reported. This would bring the total number of incidences to 2.8 million. That\u2019s an incidence rate of 34%. Now I know, these calculations are crude, however the error on my part I have tried to leave to the downside of the final value, but you see my point and you see how the statements made by the BBC are intentionally deceptive. But Don\u2019t Worry \u2013 It Doesn\u2019t matter anyway! That\u2019s right, even if a link is found, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can just prepare, as Dr. Male says: \u201cIf a link between vaccination and menstrual changes is confirmed, this information will allow people to plan for potentially altered cycles,\u201d BBC News[1] All links to potential fertility issues are then stated as being \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019. No mention of the study released to the public[4] via a freedom of information act request from Japanese health authorities which shows the lipid concentration in various parts of the body following vaccination. The lipid nanoparticles called ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 which travel with the spike protein, we found to accumulate in the ovaries within fifteen minutes of vaccination. But more concerning is that the nanoparticle accumulation showed a linear increase in the ovaries through the end of the study\u2019s duration window of 48 hours.",

        "text":"The ongoing so-called \u2018pandemic\u2019 has hit everyone hard, no one has escaped the grip of the tyrannical reaction from Governments around the World, but there is a group of the population which is suffering in silence, in plain view, this group are the future of human society and parents are unknowingly through their own ignorance, destroying them both physically and mentally. Let\u2019s talk about the Children. Another Brick in The Wall Witnessing children going to school was a shocking sight to behold, as the bused loaded with fully masked children parked up outside the school gates, children were ushered off the bus by a team of teachers who ensured social distancing was achieved as the children made their way to their new pandemic modified classrooms. With all over 12-year-olds now expected to wear Face Masks throughout the day, social distancing maintained where possible and the constant reminder of the big bad scary COVID-19 lurking around every corner; School is quite the little house of horrors. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Parents are shamefully allowing their children, and likely encouraging them either directly or indirectly to wear face masks out in public, when shopping or at the park. Virtue Signalling While shopping the other day at my local supermarket, I witnessed multiple parents with children as young as 5 fully masked, in one case they had matching pink face masks. Ugggh! Using your children as part of your ridiculous virtue signalling games is disgusting. Under any other circumstances, this unquestionably would be considered as \u2018Child Abuse\u2019. Covering a child\u2019s airways and thus restricting airflow to the child\u2019s lungs is clearly an issue. Where are those lovely child-snatchers over at social services now? But the physical abuse is just a very small part of the problem. It is the ongoing psychological abuse on children that really is at a scale never witnessed before. Fear is the Mind Killer For over a year, children have been placed in a perpetual state of fear, the fear of the killer bug, the fear for their own lives, but even more so, the fear of killing those they love \u2013 their parents, their grandparents. \u201cStay Safe!\u201d. When people I deal with say this to me in closing our conversation I want to scream. It\u2019s everywhere, from billboards to motorway information displays. Everywhere I go, \u201cStay Safe\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d. Please enough, if it makes me feel like I\u2019m loosing my sanity, god only knows how young children are feeling right now. Filthy Little Rats! We live in unprecedented times, a time where social division is promoted and human contact is condemned. For the first time in history, a child is now made to feel guilty for cuddling up to their parents, a time when a hug is needed more than ever. Britons should not hug their children even once they\u2019ve been vaccinated, an expert has stressed \u2013 The Evening Standard[1] And keep away from your much loved Grandparents, don\u2019t touch them \u2013 you might kill them: Grandparents who have received the Covid vaccine should not yet hug their families, a professor has warned, amid fears that those who have had the jab will abandon the lockdown rules. \u2013 The Telegraph[2] \u201cKeep those filthy little child hands to yourself, you are a potentially deadly weapon and you wouldn\u2019t want to kill your own loved ones, would you? Stay Safe!\u201d Mental Abuse I cannot begin to imagine how all this feels for children right now, but new data is emerging and it doesn\u2019t look pretty. Dr. Richard Delorme heads the psychiatric department at one of the largest children\u2019s hospitals in France and what he is seeing is devastating: \u201cWe are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old,\u201d Delorme said. \u201cWe sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it\u2019s not simply aprovocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives.\u201d \u2013AP News[3] Depression in children grew exponentially just through the UK\u2019s first lockdown: \u201cTo give an indication of how large this effect is, imagine ranking the children into 100 \u2018centiles\u2019 depending on their scores,\u201d explained Dr Duncan Astle from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and senior author of the study. \u201cA child in the 50th centile would be exactly at the middle of the distribution. But a child at this position before the pandemic, could expect to be at the equivalent of the 77th centile during the lockdown. \u201cPut differently, if you randomly selected a child from the sample there is a 70% chance that their depression symptoms were worse during lockdown than before the pandemic.\u201d \u2013 University of Cambridge[4] That was the observation of children just after a few months of the pandemic. What are the effects a year on? Ignorance is Bliss In many cases parents play a large part of this abuse, by participating in this pandemic fiasco, reinforcing the lies and fears presented by the Government and media, they are validating fear and confusion in their children. It\u2019s disgusting and unforgiveable. There is no excuse for lack of research and critical thinking, particularly when this neglect to one\u2019s own knowledge results in the abuse of your own children. Parents who pander to these false fears in front of their children should be shamed, they should be held accountable. Not by Government, they\u2019ve done quite enough damage, but by society. Good is Bad; Black is White But in this topsy-turvy World it is I that is shamed; shamed for taking my children out shopping; shamed for failing to sanitize my children\u2019s hands and my own at every entry and exit point; failure to wear a mask or prevent my children from running around like lunatics as if there was nothing to fear. We are the lepers, the freaks, the odd ones out. We who have ensured our children remain free, happy and emotionally satisfied both mentally and physically. We are the parents of concern, simply for loving our children first and foremost. Take this piece from the teen propaganda publication Teen Vogue entitled \u2018Young People on Holiday Risks With Parents Who Ignore COVID-19 Restrictions'[5] for example: Selena\u2019s mom hasn\u2019t tempered her activities because of COVID-19restrictions \u2014 she\u2019s still going on out-of-town trips and gambling in casinos. Selena\u2019s aunt, a nurse, doesn\u2019t wear her mask dependably. She says her mother\u2019s side of the family doesn\u2019t know anyone who has gotten sick or died from COVID, so it\u2019s easy for them to pretend it isn\u2019t real. Plus, she says, they don\u2019t listen to reliable news sources \u2014 \u201csome of them still claim that the election was a fraud, so it\u2019s one of those situations.\u201d \u2013 Teen Vogue[5] This shameful piece of propaganda continues to vilify the parents while validating and indeed amplifying children\u2019s fears using unconfirmed science: But there are now reports of people contracting the virus twice, suggesting immunity may not last. Teen Vogue[5] It is true that there are cases of people contracting the virus twice, but we are talking about a small handful of cases from the millions that have contracted the virus. The article intentionally fails to elaborate on this topic, they simply make the statement that you can catch it twice, and leave it there. This article is just one of thousands designed to turn children against their parents. Its psychological warfare against your children, you and the family unit as a whole. Please, I urge you, no matter what your views on the pandemic are, please put your children first, second and third. There is nothing more important in this world than our children, they are our future, our legacy. Please leave your comments below.",

        "text":"Just a year ago if you asked anyone if they would like an experimental vaccine that has only been in trials for a few months, has no significant safety data, negligible efficacy data and 80% of test subjects had moderate to high adverse effects, to help protect against a disease which effects only a small fraction of society, specifically the old and vulnerable, all but the clinically insane would have told you where to go. How times have changed. So what happened? The Year of Fear Fear is an important human response, it is an emotion with one goal in mind, saving your ass. Fear facilitates adaptation and constitutes a survival and defense mechanism that developed so that individuals could respond to adverse situations quickly and efficiently. In that sense, fear is a normal and beneficial emotion, not just for individual survival but also for the entire human species. Fear is considered \u201cnormal\u201d when its intensity corresponds to the seriousness of the threat. In other words, the object of fear has characteristics that could threaten a person\u2019s life. \u2013 Exploring Your Mind[1] But sadly, as with all human emotions, it can be easily exploited. 2020 saw the greatest exploitation of the human fear emotion the World has ever seen. From the early days in Wuhan where we saw people dropping to the floor in pools of blood, to the piles of bodies outside of hospitals and what about those insane prediction models coming out of the Imperial College! The facts surrounding the events are unimportant, or at least they have been to the Government and media. What is important is that it generates fear in the population. Fear has been the main driver of this pandemic, it has been the very lifeblood of this pandemic. The actual facts just wouldn\u2019t have been enough to ensure compliance. We needed all-out psychological warfare to keep this baby going. Over the past year we have seen people become fearful of the very environment they live in and the people that inhabit it, all thanks to the response to this pandemic. People are so scared of the virus that they would choose to neglect someone in need, even a family member, because their fear overshadowed their love. Our Lord & Saviour, the Vaccine With running commentary all the way back from the beginning about how the only way out of this pandemic was with \u2018a vaccine\u2019, is it any wonder this COVID-19 vaccine has developed something of god-like status? First of all, we were told it was our saviour, our only hope. But then we were left hanging with comments from many experts saying \u201cA vaccine before the end of 2021 is unlikely\u201d. The vaccine-carrot has been just off in the distance, out of reach, every step of the way. But then, hallelujah, we were seeing promise of a vaccine by Christmas! By the New Year we had a choice, we had the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna Vaccine. People had a choice, people could drool over the one they thought was the best. But hang on, you might have to wait?! Wait in Line How exciting it must be to get that letter through the post, much like Charlie receiving his golden ticket to Wonker\u2019s Chocolate factory, the feeling I\u2019m sure is something else. \u2018I was chosen, it\u2019s my turn and I beat you to it!\u2019 Brilliant indeed. How else were they going to convince an entire nation to be the phase three clinical trials of a new experimental vaccine using new technology with absolutely no long-term studies, in fact nothing exceeding just a few months? My hat goes off to them. They did good. Wait, there are shortages, we might have to delay the second dose to ensure others can get their first dose?! \u2026.chief executive of NHS England, said there is a global \u201csupply shortage\u201d of the vaccines, as manufacturers struggle to keep up with demand. \u2013 Sky News[2] This type of narrative is all we have heard since even before the vaccines were being manufactured on mass. Leaders around the World were fighting over who had how many, and when \u2013 it has been like watching a soap opera, with a terrible cast and an equally terrible script. But it works. This sense of missing out, or FOMO(fear of missing out) really does do the trick regarding demand. When people fear they might be unable to have something offered, they want it even more \u2013 it\u2019s human instinct. And this, my friends, is how you get an entire population scrabbling over an experimental vaccine. Stay Informed All I ask of anyone, is that they do their own research and due diligence, your initial thoughts maybe that this decision is a no-brainer \u2013 \u2018of course I\u2019ll have the vaccine\u2019. But this lack of thought is the result of the biased information you have been subjected too. It really isn\u2019t as simple as that. People are dying from the vaccine, people are getting severely injured from the vaccine, as they do with all vaccines. The difference this time is that we do not know what we are dealing with, this time we have literally just a few months of trial data to rely on (all of which is still unreleased by the pharmaceutical companies, so much for their pledge for transparency[3]). Experts are surprised by the high frequency of adverse effects, countries like Norway have experienced dozens of deaths following vaccination of their elderly. And while health officials and the media may shrug all these issues off as \u2018coincidence\u2019, can we really be sure they are? Here is the real question you need to ask yourself: What is the risk to benefit ratio? If you are under 75 and relatively healthy, there is no point in taking this vaccine, it can offer you nothing your immune system can do better. If you are over 75, and\/or have health issues, do you think your immune system is ready for the vaccine? Baring in mind the high rate of adverse effects from the shot. I understand it\u2019s a tough decision for many, the vaccine may feel like an antidote for the perpetual fear you have been going through \u2013 but just know this, all the data on mortality over the past year shows nothing particularly significant is occurring. Excess deaths are up marginally, but we\u2019ve had worse in the past decade. Everything we hear about the hospitals being overrun, bodies piling up in the streets \u2013 it\u2019s all due to the reaction and not the problem. If you put 40+% of your perfectly healthy medical staff into self-isolation due to a testing system that has been proven to be flawed, you can expect to see hospitals fall into chaos. If you reduce your hospital beds every year by 10% for decades (as they have been here in the UK), then you can expect trouble sooner or later. If you have more 85 and above year olds than ever before in the population, then isolate them, throw a few COVID infected patients in with them \u2013 reduce the number of people to look after them \u2013 Well, expect a lot of them to die. There are a million and one reasons why the excess deaths are marginally higher over the past 12 months, and all of them have very little to do with a deadly virus.",

But first I\u2019d like you to focus on just where this massive peak of unvaccinated deaths occurs. What do you notice? Shock horror! It\u2019s in the peak of winter when mortality is always at its highest and, wait for it, at a time when less than 5% of the population were vaccinated. From march onwards, the numbers decline as the unvaccinated proportion of the population decreases and winter subsides into summer. In fact, the vaccinated begin to rise above the unvaccinated. But undeniably, yes, the double jabbed death rate does appear to be significantly lower from COVID-19 related deaths. But here\u2019s the thing, there have been more deaths following vaccination reported via the UK\u2019s vaccine injury reporting system since the middle of March through to the beginning of March than there has of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated in the same timeframe. The UK Column has created an improved frontend for the Governments Yellow Card reporting system HERE[5].

        "text":"What is the best way to convince the general public into taking an experimental vaccine which has limited safety and efficacy trials? Of course, you use actors and other performance artists to convince them. Most people do not want the science or data to hand when making important decisions like this, but give them a familiar face from the little box in the room, telling them to be good little girls and boys and hey presto, informed consent complete! Before I get into these so-called celebrities who have sold their souls to the devil, I\u2019d like to point out the fact that the NHS & the British media warned the public that this was exactly how they were going to convince the public into being human guinea pigs back in November of 2020: NHS bosses plan to enlist celebrities and \u201cinfluencers\u201d with big social media followings in a major campaign to persuade people to have a Covid vaccine amid fears of low take-up. Ministers and NHS England are drawing up a list of \u201cvery sensible\u201d famous faces in the hope that their advice to get immunised would be widely trusted, the Guardian has learned. \u2013 The Guardian[1] This tactic however is nothing new, some of you may remember singer and full-time drug addict Elvis Presley taking the Polio Vaccine on national television in 1956, which led to a staggering 90% vaccine uptake in no time![2] One can only assume that finding \u2018very sensible\u2019 celebrities willing to place the general population into a position of potential harm proved harder than expected.

        "text":"NHS Nurse Tracey McCallum faces losing her career of more than 20 years after sharing he views on the pandemic on social media. The media are claiming McCallum has been spreading \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 online about the pandemic after doing \u2018her own research online\u2019, but in reality all she has done is shared a different opinion on current events. She is being accused of the following: Claiming face masks are helping spread the virus This is something which even the studies raise concerns over, while face masks appear to make a small difference in a medical environment where strict protocols are adhered too, in the general population they may indeed do more harm than good. Even Good Morning Britains Dr. Hillary stated: It can do harm if you do wear a mask, you adjust it, it gets itchy and moist \u2013 which means you are putting your hand to your face more often. If the mask gets moist, it traps the virus. \u2013 Metro[1] While McCallum said there was evidence that masks were a: \u201cbreeding ground for bacteria and viruses\u201d Has Dr Hillary been suspended then, because she has basically repeated verbatum what this well respected TV Doctor publically stated on national television? To date, there is no real evidence to back up the claims that a Face Mask will prevent the transmission of the virus within the general population, it\u2019s purely a matter of opinion. Openly slamming the new vaccine comparing it to \u201cgenocide\u201d Tracey McCallum has also opened fire on the new COVID-19 vaccines, she has publically compared them to \u2018genocide\u2019. Of course they have yet to be released onto the general public, so no genocide has occurred\u2026..yet. When asked about her comments, she responded: \u201cWhat I was meaning was that nurses were fooled in the war, through the Holocaust, into giving people medication. There have been a lot of bad side effects. I know a lot of nurses who don\u2019t want to take it and I think \u2018if you don\u2019t want to take it then why give it to someone else?\u2019\u201d Is this a Conspiracy Theory, no, it\u2019s an opinion based on real concerns. All the COVID-19 vaccines are being designed, produced, trialed and then mass produced all within a few months. The safety trials haven\u2019t shown huge promise, and clearly even the UK Government are expecting major problems when the vaccine finally does hit the publics bloodstreams: The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) \u2013 OYE NEWS[2] Backing hydroxychloroquine taken by Donald Trump but dismissed by world health chiefs Hydroxychloroquine may indeed have been dismissed by \u2018World Health Chiefs\u2019, but these so called chiefs are not leaders in the field of medicine.

        "text":"These include heavier than usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after all three Covid vaccines, out of more than 47 million doses given to women in the UK to date.- BBC News[1] Did you notice the misleading data included in that statement? \u201947 million doses given to women in the UK to date\u2019 \u2013 So what are we discussing here, menstrual cycles. Right, so how many of this 47 million doses were given to post-menopausal women. Well, we have around 12.5 million women between the ages of 20 and 50. I\u2019ve used this age range because young women commonly have menstrual cycle issues due to developing hormones, birth control and lifestyle and 50 is the average age of menopause. This brings the number down to around 12 million. Now we have to reduce this further based on vaccination status. This is more tricky to determine if we are to believe the commonly touted percentage of 80% this brings the amount down to 9.6 million. Early menopause occurs in amount 5% of women under 45[2], so we can reduce this number to 9.1 million. Polycystic ovaries effects 10% of the population[3] and so this brings the number down further to around 8.2 million. Of course, we can reduce this number further if we had the data, but since this is quite a crude calculation anyway, we\u2019ll leave it there in \u2018their\u2019 favour. Now consider the fact that 30,000 reports do not equate to 30,000 actual incidences of menstrual irregularity. As you well know, studies on the VAERs reporting system found that as little as 1% of adverse events were reported. When it comes to menstrual irregularities, this number could be even less considering the perceived seriousness of it. But for argument\u2019s sake let us assume 5% have been reported. This would bring the total number of incidences to 2.8 million. That\u2019s an incidence rate of 34%. Now I know, these calculations are crude, however the error on my part I have tried to leave to the downside of the final value, but you see my point and you see how the statements made by the BBC are intentionally deceptive. But Don\u2019t Worry \u2013 It Doesn\u2019t matter anyway! That\u2019s right, even if a link is found, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can just prepare, as Dr. Male says: \u201cIf a link between vaccination and menstrual changes is confirmed, this information will allow people to plan for potentially altered cycles,\u201d BBC News[1] All links to potential fertility issues are then stated as being \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019. No mention of the study released to the public[4] via a freedom of information act request from Japanese health authorities which shows the lipid concentration in various parts of the body following vaccination. The lipid nanoparticles called ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 which travel with the spike protein, we found to accumulate in the ovaries within fifteen minutes of vaccination. But more concerning is that the nanoparticle accumulation showed a linear increase in the ovaries through the end of the study\u2019s duration window of 48 hours.",

        "text":"(Natural News) Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a second time, even though he was injected with four doses of the clot shot. In an Aug. 15 statement posted on the Department of Defense\u2018s (DoD) website, Austin said he tested positive for COVID-19 that morning and that he was \u201cexperiencing mild symptoms.\u201d \u201cI will retain all authorities and plan to maintain my normal work schedule virtually from home,\u201d said the top official, adding that he \u201cwill quarantine \u2026 for the next five days\u201d as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2018s COVID-19 guidelines. He first contracted COVID-19 in January, also with mild symptoms. \u201cAs in January, my doctor told me that my fully vaccinated status, including two booster shots, is why my symptoms are less severe than would otherwise be the case. I will continue to consult closely with my doctor in the coming days.\u201d According to Austin, his last in-person contact with President Joe Biden was on July 29. Incidentally, the commander-in-chief tested positive for COVID-19 eight days earlier on July 21. Since his last in-person contact with Biden, the head of the Pentagon traveled to the U.S. Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and met with U.S. troops and government officials in Latvia. Charlie Dietz, public affairs officer at the Pentagon, said contract tracing has commenced, and that all of Austin\u2019s close contacts had been notified of the defense secretary\u2019s illness. Austin\u2019s Aug. 15 announcement makes him the latest White House official to contract SARS-CoV-2. Biden himself became COVID-positive on July 21, with mild symptoms. The quadruple-vaccinated president started taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid and subsequently tested negative on July 27. However, he experienced a rebound infection on July 30 \u2013 a day after his in-person interaction with the defense secretary. Earlier, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci caught COVID-19 in June. The infectious disease expert reported \u201cmild\u201d symptoms, which he attributed to the four COVID-19 vaccine doses he received. Just like Biden, he took a course of Paxlovid that initially addressed his infection \u2013 only for his COVID-19 to return with a vengeance. Austin\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandates undermine military readiness Back in August 2021, Austin mandated that all military members receive the COVID-19 vaccine under penalty of termination. \u201cI, therefore, direct the secretaries of the military departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed forces under DoD authority \u2026 who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d the secretary stated in an Aug. 25 memo. However, the COVID-19 vaccines Austin ordered military members to get failed to protect him from contracting COVID-19. Worse, these lethal shots only caused vaccine injuries. A July 2022 analysis by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) warned that the military could lose $4 billion in training costs if it discharges 62,000 troops turning down the COVID-19 vaccine. Aside from monetary losses, the analysis warned that the military could lose thousands of man-years of experience, rank and grade. \u201cThe Pentagon\u2019s absurd mandate for an experimental vaccine puts our national security at risk,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cLosing tens of thousands of soldiers during a time of recruitment shortages would be a catastrophe.\u201d (Related: Our nation\u2019s security is at risk due to Biden\u2019s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn.) According to the U.S. Army, between $55,000 and $74,000 is spent on every recruit for initial training alone. With 62,000 soldiers facing termination over their refusal to comply with the Pentagon\u2019s vaccine mandate, it will take about $4 billion and a long period of time to replenish this loss. Furthermore, the number of military members to be axed for noncompliance is almost as big as the whole Canadian military \u2013 which has 68,000 troops. \u201cDespite the dubious efficacy of the vaccine in protecting the lives and readiness of our warfighters, the COVID-19 vaccine is still being required through coercion and force. If allowed to proceed uncontested, this threat presents a significant curtailing of unit manning and, therefore, readiness.\u201d Watch this G News report about Austin\u2019s first COVID-19 infection back in January 2022.

        "text":"(Natural News) A triple-jabbed doctor and professor from Israel is speaking out against Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d \u2013 which he helped develop, by the way. Prof. Shmuel Shapira, MD, MPH, who led the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) from 2013 to 2021, worked alongside Pfizer to unleash experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) technology on the world. But, ever since he personally suffered adverse events from the shots, Shapira has become something of a crusader against them. Shapira has an extensive resume working for the Israeli government. He is a Full Colonel (Res.) in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and is also the head of IDF\u2019s Head of Trauma Branch. He has published more than 110 peer-reviewed studies and was previously considered to be Israel\u2019s top-dog military scientist involved with chemical and biological weapons. For Shapira to go on Twitter and warn about how the jabs cause myocarditis and stroke certainly caught the social media platform\u2019s attention. He is, after all, one of the world\u2019s highest ranking medical scientists. Then, for Shapira to go on Twitter and link covid injections to the alleged outbreak of monkeypox was the final straw, apparently. (Related: Trump played a critical role as one of the ringleaders in unleashing Fauci Flu shots at warp speed). \u201cMonkey pox cases were rare for years,\u201d Shapira wrote in a now-deleted tweet that Twitter forced him to censor. \u201cDuring the last years a single case was documented in Israel. It is well established the mRNA vaccines affect the natural immune system. A monkey pox outbreak following massive covid vaccination: *Is not a coincidence.\u201d Even the top dogs are now speaking out Ever since Shapira first joined Twitter back in January, he has been on a tweeting spree concerning the jabs. His first post criticized Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was given the Israeli Genesis Award for his \u201caccomplishments.\u201d \u201cInstead of giving it to an Israeli scientist, and all this for a mediocre, short-acting vaccine that yielded Pfizer a profit of billions, a wretched and exiled one,\u201d Shapira chided. \u201cBourla will be appointed the King of Israel now. Let me remind you that vaccinated Israel is the fourth-leading in the number of corona patients in the world. There is a championship!\u201d he added sarcastically. In a post a couple weeks later, Shapira appears to have referenced himself by suggesting that he has gotten sick twice, \u201c[n]ot to mention significant side effects,\u201d despite being triple-injected for the Chinese Flu. \u201cThe CEO of the company, millions of whose vaccines were used in Israel for vaccination, stated in an interview with NBC that Israel serves as the world\u2019s laboratory,\u201d Shapira later wrote in an April 9 tweet. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, this is the first case in history where experimental guinea pigs paid an exorbitant rate for their participation.\u201d Once again in May, Shapira mentioned his three injections and how they left him \u201cphysically injured in a very significant way as many others were injured.\u201d \u201cAnd in addition, my trust in the nature of the decisions and in the processes of making them has been severely eroded,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one asked and checked. I will fight with all my might so that truthful answers regarding all decisions and not just regarding the vaccine are given.\u201d Other criticisms from Shapira\u2019s now-censored Twitter account include one about how Israel is now on jab five, despite the latest \u201cvariants\u201d being so distinctly different from original that there is no chance they will provide even a modicum of protection. \u201cI will continue and ask why give an outdated fifth vaccine that does not prevent disease and apparently causes many significant common side effects,\u201d Shapira wrote.

However, the group\u2019s posts are now being censored by Facebook. \u201cWe will be moving our group over to a new uncensored TrialSite News soon due to the growing censorship we are facing,\u201d said Catherine Parker, the group\u2019s founder. She stressed the need for support groups like these to not be taken down from social media sites. (Related: Global campaign aims to break silence around COVID vaccine injuries.) Parker, who was injured by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, added: \u201cA lot of us have anxiety and depression from this now. And I hear people who just want to give up or they feel like they are dying or that [they] wanted not to wake up.\u201d She said she was never an anti-vaxxer. As a requirement for her job, she took the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on April 1, 2021 and the Pfizer booster on November 9, 2021. Within two to three weeks of receiving the first shot, she began having chronic insomnia and exhaustion. But she ignored these and proceeded to have the Pfizer booster. Less than two weeks after getting the booster, she began losing hair and was diagnosed with dysautonomia, pseudoparkinsonism and Epstein Barr virus, also known as human herpesvirus 4. Parker, 49, wanted to help others enduring similar experiences and founded the support group. Within two weeks, over 200 members from all over the world joined to \u201ctell their heartbreaking stories and also inspire resiliency to keep going through the health conditions.\u201d \u201cIt has been difficult to get out our stories to the world,\u201d Parker said. \u201cEverywhere we turn, we are blocked and banned on social media. Our videos are removed for \u2018community standards violations,\u2019 which makes no sense when they are videos of our pain and suffering or us going through tremors and brain fog.\u201d She added that groups like hers are ridiculed and made fun of as crazy, lying pigs, \u201canti-vax\u201d and people with agendas to stop others from getting the vaccine. \u201cIt breaks my heart, how far humanity has fallen that it is okay to make fun of others\u2019 suffering and downplay what others are going through,\u201d she said. COVID-19 vaccine brings physical and emotional injuries Donna Zuk Adley, 64, is a 33-year nurse from Connecticut and holds degrees in criminal justice and legal studies. She is the co-administrator of the vaccine injury support group. In an exclusive interview with the news website Defender, she said that she was reluctant to get the coronavirus vaccine from the get-go because she had \u201ctwo previous reactions to vaccines, one of which [tetanus] left her with a permanent partial disability.\u201d She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia after a tetanus shot. \u201cI had restricted my lifestyle, and did all the protocols to avoid COVID,\u201d she stated. \u201cI had been working on a COVID floor with up to 32 COVID patients, and never got COVID.\u201d However, in August 2021, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont mandated all workers in a broadly defined list of medical and long-term care facilities to get vaccinated. Adley got her first dose of the mRNA vaccine in August and her second dose in September 2021. \u201cAfter the first Moderna [dose], I had severe lower back pain that felt like shattered glass. I did not realize at the time that many have this symptom after the vaccines. [On] September 17, eight hours after my second dose, I began to get the initial symptoms that I had expected (fever, muscle aches), [but] I felt very strange and weak as if I had a mono relapse, which I hadn\u2019t had in over a decade.\u201d she said, adding that her symptoms worsened after that. She began to have lapses in memory and blurred vision. She also began to feel confused and felt like she has a \u201cbrain disconnect\u201d as she lost the ability to think right, comprehend and follow directions. Adley likened the experience to feeling like \u201ca voodoo doll where someone keeps taking turns stabbing me in my different body systems,\u201d and a \u201cpinball machine in slow motion.\u201d She kept a notebook of her symptoms and injuries and categorized them broadly as brain and cognitive, gastrointestinal, lungs (respiratory), muscular and skin. These symptoms \u201caffected everything,\u201d she said. She was terminated from her job of 10 years because she \u201ctook too long\u201d to return from the leave due to her vaccine injuries. Finding a new job has also been a challenge as she often received feedback that her medical [vaccine] exemption was denied by \u201ccorporate.\u201d The loss of her employment also meant the loss of her health insurance and she added that \u201cwalk-ins were not accepting me.\u201d Visit VaccineInjuryNews.com for more news related to the COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.

She says the hospital system where she used to work never would have tolerated any of what she does now. (Related: Check out our earlier coverage about some of the natural remedies that science shows are effective against the Fauci Flu.) \u201cThey will not consider protocols outside of what\u2019s given to them by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the NIH (National Institute of Health),\u201d Kay told The Epoch Times. \u201cAnd nobody is asking why.\u201d How many covid patients were murdered by staff at American hospitals?

Fortunately for Kay, she found an inpatient protocol designed by Dr. Paul Marik, a founding member of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance. That protocol is said to have about a 94 percent success rate \u2013 a success rate far higher than anything Kay\u2019s hospital was doing. Kay tried to pitch the protocol to the pulmonary critical care department, only to be scoffed at and have the idea dismissed. At the time, that department was only seeing about a 66 percent survival rate. \u201cI told him, \u2018I feel like we can do better,\u2019 but I was very quickly shut down,\u201d Kay says about her encounter with her superiors. \u201cI became very angry because I\u2019m watching people die and I knew we could have been doing better.\u201d Formerly smart, or at least smart-seeming, people at Kay\u2019s hospital had suddenly become fully and totally brainwashed by Fauci and his minions, and could not in any way be reasoned with in the interest of patient health and safety. Kay says the people she used to work for and with went from being brainwashed to \u201cjust dumb,\u201d which is something that many other nurses just like her experienced at their hospital systems in other states. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s corporate control over medicine, whether it\u2019s Medicare or private insurance companies, you\u2019re always going to have providers who are forced, pressured, and coerced to do things that they wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d says Kay, who now runs her own private consulting and telemedicine service.

Because of this, say lawyers, those suing for damages over the mandates now have an even stronger case against the government and every institution that engaged in medical tyranny. The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) says it fully expects that defendants in natural immunity challenges will try to argue that such lawsuits are now moot because of the CDC\u2019s backtracking. But according to attorney Jenin Younes, those cases are still fully valid, no matter the CDC shenanigan of the day. \u201c\u2026 because we argued that their constitutional rights were already violated, and we are seeking recognition of that going forward, the courts should not dismiss the appeals (or cases still pending in lower courts) on mootness grounds,\u201d Younes wrote in an email. At least four separate NCLA cases are potentially affected by the CDC\u2019s policy reversals, including one against Michigan State University\u2018s employee mandate, another against Rhode Island\u2019s healthcare worker mandate, and a number of class-action suits against federal employees and federal contractors. Every American negatively affected by covid mandates needs to sue the CDC Attorney Michael Senger is outraged over the CDC\u2019s about-face, seeing as how millions of workers, students, and others lost their jobs, were told they could not receive an education, or were forced to take unwanted jobs while facing exclusion \u201cfrom everyday life activities and basic medical care,\u201d all because of \u201ca differentiation that the CDC now admits does not make sense.\u201d Senger was involved with a now-dismissed Big Tech case that is seeking to be reinstated. There are other cases as well within the military, for instance, which is not changing its jab mandate requirements despite the changes made to the CDC guidance. Attorney R. Davis Younts, who successfully represented a Navy lieutenant in a mandate challenge from back in the spring, says the military \u201cabsolutely should\u201d change its policy \u201cbecause the whole justification for denying religious accommodation [requests] is that there\u2019s no safe alternative to the vaccine.\u201d Now that the CDC has admitted that the shots are medically useless, Younts hopes that military servicemen resisting them will resubmit their RARs based on the fact that the CDC\u2019s position on the matter has changed. \u201cIt seems like every day the FDA or the CDC or some report continues to confirm what we\u2019ve been saying: that there\u2019s no reason for these shots,\u201d says Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver. Liberty Counsel is actively challenging the jab requirement in the armed forces, and Staver has promised to provide updates about the \u201cvarious different courts we\u2019re in.\u201d \u201cI think this is another mile marker in the long march of incompetence from Washington bureaucrats that claims to follow \u2018science\u2019 yet this science has been out for well over a year and has been ignored by the CDC and the corporations that are clearly state actors,\u201d added U.S. Freedom Flyers co-founder Joshua Yoder, whose group challenged jab mandates for pilots.

        "text":"(Natural News) A new study on cardiovascular impacts of the COVID vaccines done in Thailand is particularly troubling: 29% of the young adults experience non-trivial changes in their cardiac biomarkers. (Article by Steve Kirsch republished from SteveKirsch.Substack.com) It is amazing what you find when scientists doing a study are honest and want to know the truth. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t a study like this being done in the US?\u201d asks UCSF Professor Vinay Prasad. Heck, we don\u2019t even know the d-dimer of people before vs. after the vax. This is just more evidence of corruption of the medical community that nobody was calling for any of this data. These vaccines are a disaster. Every day, the evidence gets worse and worse. Will this new study stop the vaccines for kids? Of course not! Look, even if the shots killed every child under 20 who takes it, they\u2019d write off the death to something else and recommend that kids get the shot. The brainwashing is that bad. It\u2019s stunning. Facts do not matter. Note: This was originally buried in my Fox justification article but it\u2019s important enough to call out in a separate article. The Thailand study Consider this Thailand study: 18% of kids had an abnormal EKG post-vaccine?!? That has to be extremely troubling. A vaccine is not supposed to do that. Are doctors telling parents the vaccine causes serious heart issues in 18% of kids? At least let them know. The paper noted that \u201cCardiovascular effects were found in 29.24% of patients, ranging from tachycardia, palpitation, and myo\/pericarditis.\u201d Wow. Almost 30% of the cases?!?! That\u2019s not \u201crare.\u201d Finally a 3.5% rate of myo\/pericarditis (including subclinical) among males 13-18 is not rare either. We were lied to by the CDC. Big time. Interestingly, this is consistent with the number of myocarditis rates at Monte Vista Christian School in Watsonville, CA which was in excess of 1% but they wouldn\u2019t reveal any of the details beyond that publicly; gotta keep the school safe from lawsuits. Major credit there goes to Head of School Nikki Daniels for making sure that nobody found out that the shots they gave at the school were hurting kids. When adverse reactions started showing up, they did the right thing: they kept their mouths shut. Read more at: SteveKirsch.Substack.com",

        "text":"(Natural News) If your child is suffering from \u201cfull spectrum movement dysfunction\u201d or \u201cneuroleptic malignant syndrome\u201d (NMS), then it\u2019s most likely due to the \u201cbi-polar\u201d anti-psychotic medications he\/she is receiving based on a false diagnosis by a shrink. NMS is a life-threatening \u201creaction\u201d to psychotropic drugs, and symptoms or \u201cside effects\u201d include high fever, altered mental status (thoughts of suicide), muscle rigidity and autonomic dysfunction. An autonomic dysfunction occurs when the nervous system no longer regulates properly. Drugs known to cause this are called anti-psychotic prescriptions and go by the names of Latuda and Vraylar, as you may have seen commercials for them while watching streaming media (shows and movies). Doctors are now slinging these deadly drugs on kids as young as ten, without any regard to the horrific side effects that include complete muscle shut down, CNS imbalances, deepened depression, erratic behavior and suicidal tendencies. If you\u2019re considering treatment options for certain mental health conditions, it might be wise to avoid deadly Vraylar and Latuda Got schizophrenia? It might just mean you swing from angry to happy easily, or focused to confused. It could easily be the clot shots you got for COVID-19, that clog the blood leading to the brain. Experiencing episodes of \u201cbipolar mania\u201d lately? That could just be your ten year old child hyper on high fructose corn syrup, and then crashing a few hours later, unable to concentrate on boring school work. Psychiatrists refer to the DSM and diagnose combinations of emotions as bipolar depression and clinical depression so they can sling dangerous psychotropic drugs and get bonuses and spiffs. Side effects of Vraylar bi-polar drug are very scary, and much more so than the conditions being addressed Side effects of Vraylar bi-polar drug include suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and young adults. Older adults can suffer psychosis due to dementia as a adverse event from taking bi-polar prescription drugs. In clinical trials, humans suffered uncontrolled movements (called tardive dyskinesia) that could easily cause automobile accidents if the person is driving during a side effect \u201cepisode.\u201d Also be on the lookout for other side effects of Vraylar that include hyperglycemia that leads to diabetes, low white blood cell count, drops in blood pressure, seizures, irregular body temperatures and trouble swallowing. These side effects, as admitted in the black box warning, can be both short-term and long-term, including uncontrollable movements. In other words, after taking this bi-polar medication, you could have muscle spasms for the rest of your life. Side effects of Latuda bi-polar prescription are very scary, and what 10-year-olds are really \u201cbi-polar\u201d and in need of suicide-thought-inducing drugs? Latuda is just as scary as Vraylar, and maybe even more so. So if a child 10 to 17 years young is diagnosed by some quack shrink as being \u201cbi-polar,\u201d they will get prescribed a crazy drug that is \u201cpart of a treatment plan\u201d that also includes \u201cmood stabilizers\u201d (lithium or valproate). Supposedly, this plan reduces \u201csymptoms\u201d of bipolar depression, while causing side effects that are enough to make the non-prescribed parents go insane (with worry and regret) themselves. Yes, Latuda may INCREASE suicidal behaviors in \u201csome\u201d children, teenagers and young adults, which would explain all the mass shootings over the past two decades, where almost every one of them was on these types of meds. This happens within the first few months of treatment, according to the pharma giants that make it. If you know someone taking these \u201cbi-polar\u201d pills, be sure to watch for \u201cnew or worsening depression symptoms\u2026\u201d \u2013 wait, isn\u2019t that the problem the medications are supposed to stop? That\u2019s like taking medicine for diarrhea that causes worsened diarrhea, but this is more likely to end in death rather than just hospitalization. Lastly, the bi-polar pills might cause NMS (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) that\u2019s so serious it can kill you, so be sure to go to the nearest hospital after contemplating this medication because that would mean you are crazy enough to risk taking it. Did we mention nausea, weight gain and problems sleeping? Go figure. Anything to exploit our children, huh? Tune that internet frequency to BigPharmaNews.com for updates on how lots of other pharma shills are trying to lobotomize American children with dangerous drugs.

        "title":"Scientists denounce flawed study pushing for the return of school mask mandates",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-17-scientists-denounce-study-pushing-return-mask-mandates.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Scientists have denounced a study promoting the return of school mask mandates supposedly as a way to mitigate the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The preprint of the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was recently publicized online and immediately drew intense criticisms, with some scientists calling it \u201cirredeemably flawed.\u201d (Related: Yale professor scoffs at the idea that mask mandates are based on science.) The study was conducted on school districts in the Greater Boston metropolitan region. It noted that out of the 79 school districts in Greater Boston, only two cities \u2013 Boston itself and neighboring Chelsea \u2013 kept their mask mandates in K-12 schools. The researchers investigated weekly COVID-19 rates among students and staff. Of the 79 school districts in Greater Boston, 72 school districts with 294,084 students and 46,530 staff were included in the study. They also used district-level data from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education on COVID-19 cases, enrolment and staffing for the 2021 to 2022 school year. Additional data on COVID-19 indicators from the surrounding communities were obtained from the state Department of Public Health. The study allegedly found that universal masking effectively minimizes the number of severe COVID-19 cases that pop in up given areas as well as prevents widespread transmission, especially in school and community settings. The 72 school districts studied allegedly had similar COVID-19 case rates before the mask mandates were lifted. After the end of the mandates, case rates supposedly began diverging substantially, with the Boston and Chelsea school districts having far lower COVID-19 case rates among students and staff compared to the rest of the metro area. The researchers further claim that removing mask mandates in schools might have contributed to around 45 excess COVID-19 cases per 1,000 students and staff. The study\u2019s findings strongly recommend that school districts should begin developing proactive COVID-19 mitigation policies in anticipation of a surge in cases in the winter of 2022 to 2023. These policies include enforcing mask requirements as winter approaches and only lifting them later in 2023 when COVID-19 cases drop. Experts say study is riddled with errors and inaccuracies Scientists universally pushed back against the study. Dr. Alasdair Munro, a pediatric infectious disease researcher, wrote that studies like this are how \u201cjunk science\u201d spreads like wildfire. Munro added that the preprint is \u201cso riddle with basic errors\u201d that he wondered if it was an academic hoax or some kind of elaborate prank. University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad noted that the study \u201cdoes not adjust for community burden,\u201d which is a strange choice given how earlier research has proven that schools are not epicenters for superspreader events. This omission is such an elementary mistake that Prasad said \u201cthe paper should never appear in a journal.\u201d Prasad added that Massachusetts health policy exempts masked individuals from being tested for COVID-19 as \u201cclose contacts.\u201d \u201cThis is a classic research problem, and why it is always good to include skeptical voices on research teams,\u201d said Prasad. When she received pushback for her study, epidemiologist and study co-author Ellie Murray dismissed critics by arguing that masks keep children in school because they aren\u2019t required to test. Ioana Cristea, a professor at the University of Pavia in Italy and a research affiliate for Stanford University School of Medicine, argued that by Murray\u2019s logic, the solution to keeping kids in schools is to stop all COVID-19 testing altogether. \u201cIs it correct to interpret this argument as masks are an excuse to test less, which thus leads to missing more cases, which thus leads to less absences from school? Because along these lines, not testing at all fixes the issue altogether,\u201d wrote Cristea. Read more news about COVID-19 at Pandemic.news.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-12-israeli-expert-remains-unfazed-despite-tech-censorship.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Dr. Shmuel Shapira, an Israeli professor censored by Big Tech over his claim that the monkeypox outbreak is linked to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, said he remains unfazed and will continue to spread the truth about the mRNA shots. In an Aug. 7 tweet, Shapira pointed out that he now has more followers than the Twitter account of the Israeli Ministry of Health \u201cdespite their huge [public relations] budgets, trolls, bots and media support.\u201d He wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t have any of these \u2013 but my truth, transparency, evidence-based science, reputation and good name are winning.\u201d The founder and head of the Military Medicine Department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\u2018s Faculty of Medicine found himself blocked on the social media platform. Twitter prohibited him from posting unless he deleted a tweet that purportedly linked the monkeypox outbreak to the COVID-19 vaccines. (Related: Israeli doctor who linked monkeypox outbreak to covid jabs CENSORED by Twitter.) \u201cMonkeypox cases were rare for years. During the last [year], a single case was documented in Israel,\u201d Shapira wrote in the flagged tweet. \u201cIt is well established [that] the mRNA vaccines [against COVID-19] affect the natural immune system. A monkeypox outbreak following massive COVID-19 vaccination is not a coincidence.\u201d The Israeli scientist himself had suffered vaccine injuries in May after being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine, lending credence to his tweet about the risks of the mRNA shot. \u201cI received three vaccinations, [and] I was physically injured in a very significant way as many others were injured,\u201d he tweeted on May 14. \u201cIn addition, my trust in the nature of the decisions and the process of making them has been severely eroded. No one asked and checked. I will fight with all my might so that truthful answers regarding all decisions, and not just regarding the vaccines, are given.\u201d Shapira keeps on tweeting the truth about the COVID-19 vaccines Shapira\u2019s background is no joke, given his extensive medical experience. He formerly served as the director general of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) from 2013 to 2021. The professor also led the country\u2019s efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, spearheading the initiative until his departure from the IIBR in May 2021. Shapira tweeted in June that he \u201cwill continue [to] ask why [authorities would] give an outdated fifth vaccine [dose] that does not prevent disease and apparently causes many significant and common side effects.\u201d \u201cWhen misunderstandings and doubts that are difficult to deal with are raised, they start preaching morals [and] slanders. It\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to Your Honor.\u201d A month later, on July 28, the professor mentioned Twitter\u2019s warning in a post. \u201c[Twitter] warned me to remove the [tweet] connecting monkeypox to COVID-19. Each day, I understand better [the] year in which we live.\u201d Artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eli David commented on the social media site\u2019s censorship of the Israeli expert. He wrote: \u201cTwitter locked his account and forced him to delete [the offending tweet]. They know more about biology than him. \u201cThe victory will be ours. The spell is fading, and the shocking truth regarding the various damages and side effects is showing up,\u201d Shapira posted in August, unaffected by the Big Tech suppression he underwent. The Israeli scientist also enumerated the different risks that come with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. These included myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), fatal arrhythmias, abnormal heart rate, facialis (paralysis of the facial nerve) and tinnitus (ear ringing). Aside from these, the vaccines also caused a 20 percent increase in strokes and excessive gynecological bleeding. They also gave rise to conditions such as herpes zoster and monkeypox. \u201cNo worries, be happy,\u201d Shapira sarcastically concluded the tweet where he outlined all of the vaccine-linked adverse reactions.

Elizabeth Alexander, the first lady\u2019s communications director, announced the development in an Aug. 16 statement. \u201cAfter testing negative for COVID-19 on [Aug. 15] during her regular testing cadence, the first lady began to develop cold-like symptoms late in the evening. [She] tested negative again on a rapid antigen test, but a PCR test came back positive.\u201d \u201cShe is currently staying at a private residence in South Carolina and will return home after she receives two consecutive negative COVID tests,\u201d Alexander wrote. \u201cClose contacts of the first lady have been notified.\u201d The first lady, 71, is double vaccinated and has received two boosters, proving that the vaccines do not prevent infection at all. According to her spokeswoman, this was the first time Jill contracted COVID-19. This happened nearly a month after President Joe Biden contracted COVID-19. The 79-year-old chief executive tested positive for the disease on July 21, with mild symptoms. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the president is \u201cfully vaccinated and twice boosted.\u201d Aside from the Bidens, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also tested positive for COVID-19 again despite getting four vaccine doses. \u201cThis morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I am experiencing mild symptoms, and will quarantine at home for the next five days in accordance with CDC guidelines. I will retain all authorities and plan to maintain my normal work schedule virtually from home,\u201d he said in an Aug. 15 statement published on the Department of Defense\u2018s website. Jill Biden set for rebound infection following Paxlovid treatment According to Alexander, the first lady was given a course of Pfizer\u2019s antiviral drug Paxlovid. However, the drug has been known to cause rebound infections \u2013 where people who take the drug experience worse symptoms and test positive for COVID-19 once more. (Related: FDA admits Pfizer antiviral oral drug paxlovid causes life-threatening reactions when taken with common medicines.) Her husband experienced this firsthand, three days after finishing his isolation. The president returned a negative test result on July 27 after completing the five-day treatment.

Despite the rebound infection, White House Chief Physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor advised that there is no reason for the chief executive to undergo another round of Paxlovid treatment. Manufactured by the New York-based Pfizer, Paxlovid is a combination of two antiviral drugs \u2013 nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir \u201chas demonstrated antiviral activity against all coronaviruses that are known to infect humans,\u201d as per the National Institutes of Health. Ritonavir, which was previously used against HIV, ensures that there is enough levels of nirmatrelvir in the body. Back in May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an alert about rebound infections in people who take Paxlovid for COVID-19. \u201cA brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 \u2026 infection in some persons, independent of treatment with Paxlovid and regardless of vaccination status,\u201d said the alert. \u201cLimited information currently available from case reports suggests that persons treated with Paxlovid who experience COVID-19 rebound have had mild illness; there are no reports of severe disease.

        "title":"Civil rights group joins growing lawsuit against big tech for collective censorship of COVID data",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-08-civil-rights-group-joins-lawsuit-against-big-tech-censorship-covid-data.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) A noted civil rights organization has joined a lawsuit initially filed by Missouri and Louisiana that is challenging government-directed censorship of data and viewpoints regarding COVID-19 that contradicted pre-ordained deep state narratives. The New Civil Liberties Alliance, or the NCLA, represents Drs. Martin Kulldorff and Jayanta Bhattacharya, as well as Jill Hines and Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter published in October 2020 that challenged enduring coronavirus lockdowns as nonsensical, dangerous and even deadly, Reclaim The Net reports. The group is joining the suit on the heels of recently unveiled emails from the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that the federal government essentially directed the major social media platforms to censor and throttle certain opinions, viewpoints and data regarding the pandemic to include threats of legal action from federal agencies if the platforms did not comply. Reclaim The Net adds: The censorship came in many forms, including permanent and temporary suspension of accounts, as well as shadow banning, de-monetization of content, warning labels, taking down content, and limiting the spread of content. According to the NCLA, government-directed censorship is a violation of the First Amendment, which protects free speech. The government is not supposed to decide which voices get heard and which don\u2019t. \u201cThe government may not work through private entities to accomplish censorship that the First Amendment forbids the government from doing directly. Yet that is precisely what these federal defendants have been up to. NCLA is delighted to join forces with these state attorneys-general to reverse this constitutional outrage and restore free speech to the social media platforms that are today\u2019s public square,\u201d NCLA\u2019s president Mark Chenoweth noted in a statement. Added NCLA\u2019s litigation counsel Jenin Younes: \u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s involvement in silencing the voices of those who have critiqued its responses to Covid-19, through pressure exerted on social media companies, is unprecedented in nature and degree.\u201d Two of the plaintiffs, Drs. Bhattacharya and Kulldorff, are among the world\u2019s most renowned epidemiologists, and had crucial insights to share on the flawed reasoning and science underlying lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates,\u201d Younes continued. \u201cDr. Kheriaty, a professor of medical ethics, and Ms. Hines, a consumer and human rights advocate, also offered thoughtful, reasoned opposition to government-imposed Covid-19 restrictions. The government\u2019s sweeping campaign to suppress the perspectives of the plaintiffs, and others like them, represents the most severe abrogation of the First Amendment in modern times, and we look forward to seeing this constitutional atrocity rectified in a court of law,\u201d Younes noted further. As of this writing, the Great Barrington Declaration had garnered more than 930,500 signatures. \u201cAs infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection,\u201d the declaration began. \u201cComing from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,\u201d the declaration continued. \u201cThe results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health \u2013 leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice,\u201d it added. The declaration also predicted, essentially, that \u201c[k]eeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.\u201d Turns out that they were right. According to new studies, the closures \u201chave had a devastating impact on children\u2019s mental health, development and future earnings potential,\u201d Fox News reported earlier this week, adding: \u201cAccording to data released last month by the National Center for Education Statistics, 70% of U.S. public schools have reported an increase in students seeking mental health services since the start of the pandemic.\u201d We wish the plaintiffs luck in holding big tech accountable as well as any government official who had a role in the insanity.

        "text":"(Natural News) The elitist World Economic Forum should be laser-focused on the fact that nearly every country on the planet is struggling with pandemic-induced supply chain issues and stagflation, which have combined to cause record inflation \u2014 which comes as the West continues to wage war on cheap, plentiful fossil fuels under the phony guise of \u2018climate change.\u2019 But the WEF isn\u2019t really focused on economic problems now being experienced by the masses. Rather, the latest policy focus has to do with ensuring that social media platforms can automatically censor as much countervailing information as possible using the latest technology. Specifically, as reported by Reclaim The Net, the WEF wants social media platforms to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) in order to combine with human censors to strip the platforms of any political, social, cultural, economic, or policy viewpoints the globalist elite disagree with. \u201cBy uniquely combining the power of innovative technology, off-platform intelligence collection and the prowess of subject-matter experts who understand how threat actors operate, scaled detection of online abuse can reach near-perfect precision,\u201d the organization claims. Reclaim The Net noted: But what is this supposed to mean? At some point toward the end, the WEF finally spits it out (but spoiler: it still doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense): instead of relying on what is throughout the article continuously and erroneously referred to as \u201cAI\u201d \u2013 the WEF says it is proposing \u201ca new framework: rather than relying on AI to detect at scale and humans to review edge cases, an intelligence-based approach is crucial.\u201d It\u2019s well worth quoting the entire techno-bubble word salad that is supposed to be the sales pitch of the writeup. \u201cBy bringing human-curated, multi-language, off-platform intelligence into learning sets, AI will then be able to detect nuanced, novel abuses at scale, before they reach mainstream platforms. Supplementing this smarter automated detection with human expertise to review edge cases and identify false positives and negatives and then feeding those findings back into training sets will allow us to create AI with human intelligence baked in,\u201d the WEF notes in its blog post. In this way \u2013 \u201ctrust and safety teams can stop threats rising online before they reach users,\u201d the organization continued. \u201cAs the internet has evolved, so has the dark world of online harms. Trust and safety teams (the teams typically found within online platforms responsible for removing abusive content and enforcing platform policies) are challenged by an ever-growing list of abuses, such as child abuse, extremism, disinformation, hate speech and fraud; and increasingly advanced actors misusing platforms in unique ways,\u201d the post adds. The WEF post goes on to argue that platforms adding more human censors isn\u2019t enough: That technology should be used to impose more of it programmatically. \u201cThe solution, however, is not as simple as hiring another roomful of content moderators or building yet another block list. Without a profound familiarity with different types of abuse, an understanding of hate group verbiage, fluency in terrorist languages and nuanced comprehension of disinformation campaigns, trust and safety teams can only scratch the surface,\u201d the post argues. Of course, what constitutes \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cabuse\u201d is always highly arbitrary; far-left platforms think most conservative viewpoints are wrong and \u2018triggering,\u2019 as conservatives themselves are compared to and likened to \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cfascists\u201d \u2014 therefore, their opinions are fascist. \u201cA more sophisticated approach is required. By uniquely combining the power of innovative technology, off-platform intelligence collection and the prowess of subject-matter experts who understand how threat actors operate, scaled detection of online abuse can reach near-perfect precision,\u201d the WEF Forum post claims. The fact is, the mainstream social media apps and platforms are going to be used from here on out to shape and guide public opinion, not serve as a true reflection of it. Better to just disengage from them and go somewhere your voice isn\u2019t censored or muted, and where you can think for yourself. Sources include: WEForum.org NaturalNews.com ReclaimTheNet.org",

        "text":"(Natural News) We have two bombshell stories to bring you in today\u2019s article and Situation Update podcast (shown below). The first story concerns new intel from commercial suppliers, indicating that governments of the world are stockpiling supplies like never before, seemingly in anticipation of an Extinction Level Event (ELE) that threatens to wipe out the vast majority of human beings living today. The second story concerns the CDC suddenly reversing itself on all the key pillars of COVID theater: Masks, quarantines, social distancing, vaccines, testing asymptomatic patients and more. Suddenly, the CDC has essentially admitted it was all theater from the very start and was never backed by actual \u201cscience\u201d in the first place. You can catch my full commentary on both of these breaking stories in the Situation Update podcast shown here, with additional editorial explanations found below: Brighteon.com\/189b2b22-ea87-4fd2-90e9-4088198d93af Governments are preparing for an Extinction Level Event (ELE) Right now all across America, government agencies are buying up a long list of survival and preparedness gear, depleting the supply that remains available to civilians. Large-scale government purchases currently include: Storable food, MREs and emergency food supplies. Ammunition and firearms. Night vision devices. High-efficiency HVAC system components. Potassium iodide pills (for protecting the thyroid from radiation damage). Garden seeds and fertilizer. Diesel fuel, diesel engine oil and other transportation-related components. These supplies are being transported by the millions of pallets into underground caves, bunkers and even cities that are run by governments of the world. For example, it\u2019s no longer a secret that even the nation of Taiwan runs a massive underground air force base, complete with its own aircraft hangars built inside caves, along with aircraft taxi ways and transport lanes, all underground. From TheDrive.com: The Taiwanese Air Force, also known as the Republic of China Air Force, or ROCAF, has uncharacteristically released photos of weapons loading operations that were carried out in the highly-fortified underground cave-like complex connected to Chiashan Air Force Base. The photos offer a very rare look inside the subterranean tunnel network that houses some of the ROCAF\u2019s most capable fighter jets\u2026 And that\u2019s information based on what\u2019s being publicly released. What actually exists that\u2019s classified is far more extensive. In the United States, the US government has constructed massive underground cities and bunkers with tunnels connecting them across thousands of miles of underground transport tunnels, some of which are of course used for human trafficking. The point here is that the US government is preparing for the end of the world while telling civilians everything\u2019s fine. The people will never be told to prepare for anything. The people are being fed to the wolves and left to die while the government is tripling down on its own COG (Continuity Of Government) emergency plans and trying to provoke World War III with both China and Russia, all while the domestic regime wages a war of tyranny and violence against the American people via the FBI, IRS, DOJ, ATF, EPA, etc. The CDC reverses itself, admitting the entire \u201ccovid theater\u201d charade was a giant lie Also covered today is the astonishing reversal of covid guidance by the CDC, which has spent the last 2.5 years spreading quack science lies and propaganda to the world, resulting in the needless deaths of millions of people worldwide. Suddenly now, the CDC says their previous guidelines don\u2019t apply any longer. They\u2019ve dropped their demands on masks, vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people, social distancing, mandatory quarantines, keeping exposed children out of school and even about running covid tests on asymptomatic people (i.e. testing those who aren\u2019t even sick). This is a shocking, wholesale reversal of most of the lies the CDC been pushing for years, and it begs the question: Will all the employees who were fired for questioning the CDC\u2019s previous \u201cguidance\u201d now get their jobs back? Will they get back pay? Will Big Tech reverse all the censorship and deplatforming of people who questioned the CDC\u2019s lies? Will there be any apology from the complicit media outlets that peddled the CDC\u2019s propaganda for the last 2+ years? And what will be done to compensate all the children and families for the pain and suffering of unnecessary lockdowns, mandatory mask policies, the cruel isolation of children, the mask policies on airlines and all the other examples of medical insanity that ruled America since early 2020? Isn\u2019t there some sort of national apology that we are owed? What about all the small businesses that were destroyed? The lives destroyed? The marriages that were obliterated? The hospital homicides committed in the name of CDC compliance? It\u2019s time to criminally indict all the top leaders of the CDC, FDA, NIH, NIAID and everybody else involved in this massive global scam that has destroyed millions of lives while generating tens of billions of dollars in profits for the corrupt pharmaceutical giants. This CDC reversal only admits that we were right all along. The entire covid theatrical production was a quack science scheme from day one, and the people who refused to obey the CDC\u2019s absurd \u201cguidance\u201d are now completely vindicated.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-16-lloyd-austin-covid-positive-despite-four-doses.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a second time, even though he was injected with four doses of the clot shot. In an Aug. 15 statement posted on the Department of Defense\u2018s (DoD) website, Austin said he tested positive for COVID-19 that morning and that he was \u201cexperiencing mild symptoms.\u201d \u201cI will retain all authorities and plan to maintain my normal work schedule virtually from home,\u201d said the top official, adding that he \u201cwill quarantine \u2026 for the next five days\u201d as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2018s COVID-19 guidelines. He first contracted COVID-19 in January, also with mild symptoms. \u201cAs in January, my doctor told me that my fully vaccinated status, including two booster shots, is why my symptoms are less severe than would otherwise be the case. I will continue to consult closely with my doctor in the coming days.\u201d According to Austin, his last in-person contact with President Joe Biden was on July 29. Incidentally, the commander-in-chief tested positive for COVID-19 eight days earlier on July 21. Since his last in-person contact with Biden, the head of the Pentagon traveled to the U.S. Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and met with U.S. troops and government officials in Latvia. Charlie Dietz, public affairs officer at the Pentagon, said contract tracing has commenced, and that all of Austin\u2019s close contacts had been notified of the defense secretary\u2019s illness. Austin\u2019s Aug. 15 announcement makes him the latest White House official to contract SARS-CoV-2. Biden himself became COVID-positive on July 21, with mild symptoms. The quadruple-vaccinated president started taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid and subsequently tested negative on July 27. However, he experienced a rebound infection on July 30 \u2013 a day after his in-person interaction with the defense secretary. Earlier, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci caught COVID-19 in June. The infectious disease expert reported \u201cmild\u201d symptoms, which he attributed to the four COVID-19 vaccine doses he received. Just like Biden, he took a course of Paxlovid that initially addressed his infection \u2013 only for his COVID-19 to return with a vengeance. Austin\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandates undermine military readiness Back in August 2021, Austin mandated that all military members receive the COVID-19 vaccine under penalty of termination. \u201cI, therefore, direct the secretaries of the military departments to immediately begin full vaccination of all members of the Armed forces under DoD authority \u2026 who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d the secretary stated in an Aug. 25 memo. However, the COVID-19 vaccines Austin ordered military members to get failed to protect him from contracting COVID-19. Worse, these lethal shots only caused vaccine injuries. A July 2022 analysis by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) warned that the military could lose $4 billion in training costs if it discharges 62,000 troops turning down the COVID-19 vaccine. Aside from monetary losses, the analysis warned that the military could lose thousands of man-years of experience, rank and grade. \u201cThe Pentagon\u2019s absurd mandate for an experimental vaccine puts our national security at risk,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cLosing tens of thousands of soldiers during a time of recruitment shortages would be a catastrophe.\u201d (Related: Our nation\u2019s security is at risk due to Biden\u2019s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn.) According to the U.S. Army, between $55,000 and $74,000 is spent on every recruit for initial training alone. With 62,000 soldiers facing termination over their refusal to comply with the Pentagon\u2019s vaccine mandate, it will take about $4 billion and a long period of time to replenish this loss. Furthermore, the number of military members to be axed for noncompliance is almost as big as the whole Canadian military \u2013 which has 68,000 troops. \u201cDespite the dubious efficacy of the vaccine in protecting the lives and readiness of our warfighters, the COVID-19 vaccine is still being required through coercion and force. If allowed to proceed uncontested, this threat presents a significant curtailing of unit manning and, therefore, readiness.\u201d Watch this G News report about Austin\u2019s first COVID-19 infection back in January 2022.

        "title":"Dr. Ryan Cole: COVID shots linked to rising CANCER rates",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-17-ryan-cole-covid-shots-linked-cancer-rates.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Board-certified pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole believes that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are linked to rising cancer rates. The owner of Idaho-based medical laboratory Cole Diagnostics cited a January 2018 paper published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery to bolster his claim. The paper, written by researchers from Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, warned of a \u201cpossible concern\u201d with mRNA vaccines \u2013 including the ones for COVID-19. \u201cSome mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation, but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to take,\u201d the paper stated. Cole also cited animal trials for mRNA vaccines as evidence of their dangers. Test subjects developed \u201codd cancers\u201d and \u201cautoimmune diseases\u201d up to a year after they were injected, he added. Moreover, the pathologist\u2019s direct clinical experience also lent credence to his argument. According to Cole, he saw a dramatic increase in the number of people coming into his practice with gynecological cancers. The number of endometrial cancers he encountered rose by 20 times compared to what he typically sees on an annual basis. (Related: Mass COVID-19 vaccination is a deadly and unscientific policy that will cause surge in cancer rates, warns pathologist.) Given this, Cole interpreted this increase in cancers and autoimmune problems as caused by the COVID-19 vaccines damaging the immune system. Back in July 2021, the Idaho pathologist revealed that the COVID-19 vaccines causes catastrophic damage to human organs. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used as the main component in the vaccines was responsible for this vaccine damage, he said. \u201cThe spike protein doesn\u2019t just stay in the deltoid. [It] circulates in [the] blood and lands in multiple organs in the body,\u201d Cole said during the July 2021 White Coat Summit organized by America\u2019s Frontline Doctors. Spike protein in COVID shot driving force behind cancer Cole explained how the vaccines compromise the immune system during a January 2022 interview with Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American. He reiterated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used in the shot attacks receptors in the human cells that identify healthy cells from disease-causing ones. According to the Idaho doctor, he initially saw viral skin lesions \u2013 commonly found in children \u2013 developing in his adult patients. Following many biopsies, he noticed an upward trend in women\u2019s cancers, including endometrial and cervical cancers, among older individuals. \u201cAfter I reported those, I had tons of oncologists coming forward and saying \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m seeing the weird cancers \u2013 [those] we\u2019ve been able to keep in check and treat \u2013 taking off like wildfire,\u201d he told Kyrylenko. \u201cThat\u2019s because of the immune dysregulation that these shots cause.\u201d Cole pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccines turn off some of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human cells, compromising the immune system\u2019s alert mechanism. The deactivated receptors include TLR7 and TLR8, which detect viruses, and TLR3 and TLR4, which keep cancer in check. The spike protein also binds to different genes, including the P53 gene that suppresses tumors; the TMPRSS-2 gene linked to prostate cancer; and the BRCA genes linked to breast cancer in women. \u201cWe\u2019re giving a shot that makes a spike protein. That\u2019s a toxin that triggers cancer genes in bad ways and turns off other pattern receptors,\u201d said Cole. \u201c[It] causes the same disease as the virus and is predisposing people to auto-immune attacks and potentially short-term cancer risks.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long the immune system is suppressed after these shots and how long these receptors are shut off \u2013 because those studies aren\u2019t done,\u201d he concluded. Head over to VaccineDamage.news for more about how the COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer.

        "text":"(Natural News) There are varying educated opinions about the true number of deaths caused by Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d worldwide. According to Steve Kirsch, a conservative estimate is around 12 million people, a figure 40 times higher than the number of Americans who died during World War II. Kirsch says a reasonable way to estimate covid jab deaths is to divide the number of doses by 1,000. Based on the 600 million doses delivered just in the United States, this amounts to 600,000 deaths, which he says \u201cis right in the ballpark.\u201d An even more conservative calculation is to divide the number of doses by 2,500. This is the method Mathew Crawford used to conclude that 411 people die per one million doses of shot administered. (Related: Remember when the medical establishment was doing everything possible to avoid autopsying the bodies of people who took covid \u201cvaccines\u201d from the likes of Pfizer?) As a type of independent peer review, Kirsch offered up a $1 million reward to anyone who is able to debunk Crawford\u2019s figure. So far, nobody has even attempted to refute it. Using Crawford\u2019s conservative estimate, the global total of covid jab deaths is around five million, or only 16 times the number of Americans killed in WWII. \u201cWe are approaching the 6M Jews killed in the Holocaust over a period of 12 years,\u201d Kirsch writes. \u201cBut we are killing people worldwide at a rate at least 6X faster than the Germans did.\u201d \u201cWe are killing nearly close to 10,000 people every single day (the latest rate was roughly 8.46 million doses a day).\u201d Fauci Flu shots are a kiss of death Since 385,000 babies are born every day, this killing spree can theoretically go on forever, Kirsch notes \u2013 even if the birth rate ends up dropping by 90 percent due to the long-term sterilizing effects of the shots. No matter how you look at it, a lot of people are dying from these things. And governments have yet to acknowledge that fact, or the fact that covid jab deaths are far higher than actual covid deaths \u2013 assuming covid is even real as the virus they claim it is. \u201cWe are killing an awful lot of people, but world leaders are looking the other way and saying nothing while all of us watch the high number of death reports in the media of people who died \u2018unexpectedly\u2019 and hear no explanation from the medical community or the CDC,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cWe are supposed to trust that they have things well in hand, even though they won\u2019t appear on camera in front of anyone who doesn\u2019t have scripted, pre-approved questions. The vaccine is never mentioned in any of these unexplained death reports.\u201d Oddly enough \u2013 or perhaps not to readers in the know \u2013 almost nobody who refused the shots is getting sick with \u201ccovid\u201d anymore. The only people falling ill or dying are those who got \u201cfully vaccinated,\u201d \u201cboosters\u201d included. \u201cThe CDC will not require medical examiners to do the proper tests to make the association,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cThey could easily do that. But they won\u2019t. That tells you everything you need to know about the corruption.\u201d \u201cSo it will be an unexplained rise in unexplained deaths due to unknown causes because nobody in the mainstream media is ever going to admit they were wrong and ask a few unscripted questions.\u201d Kirsch also believes that Donald Trump is too afraid to speak out against the jabs, which somehow explains why he repeatedly promoted them while calling himself \u201cfather of the vaccine.\u201d To learn more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of covid \u201cvaccines\u201d and other products from Pfizer, be sure to check out ChemicalViolence.com.

Anyone who knows me, knows how much my brother meant to me and how much this loss will affect my life and my family.\u201d Those responsible for covid jabs need to face justice Though the Buyting family did not publicly indicate Buyting\u2019s cause of death, it is speculated that the clot shot is the likely culprit. Dr. William Makis, M.D., a cancer researcher at the University of Alberta and a nuclear medicine physician employed at the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) of AHS, says that all Canadian medical schools, including the one Ryan attended, mandated that all students and residents be fully vaccinated in order to get an education. \u201cI\u2019ve just been informed that Dr. Ryan Buyting, age 26, who was a promising medical student from Dalhousie and had just started Neurosurgery residency at Alberta Health Services in Edmonton, Alberta, has \u2018died suddenly,'\u201d wrote Makis, who has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed medical papers over the years. \u201cCanadian medical schools require ALL medical students and residents to be fully vaccinated (triple vaccinated) to be able to continue their education. I\u2019ve stated before that those responsible (including Deans of Faculty of Medicine) should face criminal charges and long prison sentences.\u201d Just days before Buyting perished, ASH published a news release stating that covid injections would no longer be required as a condition of employment. \u201cAlberta Health Services (AHS) is rescinding its Immunization of Workers for COVID-19 Policy, effective July 18, meaning AHS healthcare workers will no longer be required to be immunized for COVID-19 as a condition of employment,\u201d the agency announced. Buyting\u2019s sudden and unexpected death is just one of seven that have been reported throughout the region. Five occurred in the greater Toronto area \u2013 and three of these occurred at the same Toronto-area hospital \u2013 one was from Saskatchewan, and Buyting was in Alberta. Here are all seven cases along with cause of death: \u2022 Dr. Paul Hannam, July 16 \u2013 cardiac arrest while running \u2022 Dr. Lorne Segall, July 17 \u2013 lung cancer \u2022 Dr. Stephen McKenzie, July 18 \u2013 serious illness \u2022 Dr. Jakub Sawicki, July 19 \u2013 rare gastric cancer \u2022 Dr. Shariar Jalali Mazlouman, July 23 \u2013 cardiac arrest while swimming \u2022 Ryan Mackenzie Buyting, July 26 \u2013 unknown \u2022 Dr. Candace Nayman, July 28 \u2013 cardiac arrest while swimming Makis says that, in total, he has tracked a total of 13 Canadian doctors who have mysteriously died not long after getting injected for Chinese Germs. \u201cAll of them were at least triple vaccinated due to illegal vaccine mandates,\u201d he writes.

        "text":"(Natural News) Scientists have denounced a study promoting the return of school mask mandates supposedly as a way to mitigate the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The preprint of the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was recently publicized online and immediately drew intense criticisms, with some scientists calling it \u201cirredeemably flawed.\u201d (Related: Yale professor scoffs at the idea that mask mandates are based on science.) The study was conducted on school districts in the Greater Boston metropolitan region. It noted that out of the 79 school districts in Greater Boston, only two cities \u2013 Boston itself and neighboring Chelsea \u2013 kept their mask mandates in K-12 schools. The researchers investigated weekly COVID-19 rates among students and staff. Of the 79 school districts in Greater Boston, 72 school districts with 294,084 students and 46,530 staff were included in the study. They also used district-level data from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education on COVID-19 cases, enrolment and staffing for the 2021 to 2022 school year. Additional data on COVID-19 indicators from the surrounding communities were obtained from the state Department of Public Health. The study allegedly found that universal masking effectively minimizes the number of severe COVID-19 cases that pop in up given areas as well as prevents widespread transmission, especially in school and community settings. The 72 school districts studied allegedly had similar COVID-19 case rates before the mask mandates were lifted. After the end of the mandates, case rates supposedly began diverging substantially, with the Boston and Chelsea school districts having far lower COVID-19 case rates among students and staff compared to the rest of the metro area. The researchers further claim that removing mask mandates in schools might have contributed to around 45 excess COVID-19 cases per 1,000 students and staff. The study\u2019s findings strongly recommend that school districts should begin developing proactive COVID-19 mitigation policies in anticipation of a surge in cases in the winter of 2022 to 2023. These policies include enforcing mask requirements as winter approaches and only lifting them later in 2023 when COVID-19 cases drop. Experts say study is riddled with errors and inaccuracies Scientists universally pushed back against the study. Dr. Alasdair Munro, a pediatric infectious disease researcher, wrote that studies like this are how \u201cjunk science\u201d spreads like wildfire. Munro added that the preprint is \u201cso riddle with basic errors\u201d that he wondered if it was an academic hoax or some kind of elaborate prank. University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad noted that the study \u201cdoes not adjust for community burden,\u201d which is a strange choice given how earlier research has proven that schools are not epicenters for superspreader events. This omission is such an elementary mistake that Prasad said \u201cthe paper should never appear in a journal.\u201d Prasad added that Massachusetts health policy exempts masked individuals from being tested for COVID-19 as \u201cclose contacts.\u201d \u201cThis is a classic research problem, and why it is always good to include skeptical voices on research teams,\u201d said Prasad. When she received pushback for her study, epidemiologist and study co-author Ellie Murray dismissed critics by arguing that masks keep children in school because they aren\u2019t required to test. Ioana Cristea, a professor at the University of Pavia in Italy and a research affiliate for Stanford University School of Medicine, argued that by Murray\u2019s logic, the solution to keeping kids in schools is to stop all COVID-19 testing altogether. \u201cIs it correct to interpret this argument as masks are an excuse to test less, which thus leads to missing more cases, which thus leads to less absences from school? Because along these lines, not testing at all fixes the issue altogether,\u201d wrote Cristea. Read more news about COVID-19 at Pandemic.news.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-15-doctors-scientists-sue-biden-over-online-censorship.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Multiple doctors and scientists have filed a lawsuit alleging that the Biden administration has cooperated with Big Tech companies to censor American netizens from discussing issues related to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) joined the case representing Stanford University medicine professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and Harvard University former medicine academician Martin Kulldorff as well as a former member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2018s (CDC) vaccine safety subgroup. Doctors Jill Hines and Aaron Kheriaty are also represented by NCLA in the suit. \u201cPublic statements, emails, and recent publicly released documents establish that the president of the United States and other senior officials in the Biden administration violated the First Amendment by directing social media companies to censor viewpoints that conflict with the government\u2019s messaging on COVID-19,\u201d the NCLA press release read. According to the complainants, insidious censorship was the direct result of the federal government\u2019s ongoing campaign to silence those who voice perspectives that deviate from those of the Biden administration. \u201cSocial media platforms, acting at the federal government\u2019s behest, repeatedly censored NCLA\u2019s clients for articulating views on those platforms in opposition to government-approved views on COVID-19 restrictions,\u201d the lawsuit stated. The government-induced censorship has imposed complete bans, temporary bans, \u201cshadow bans\u201d (where neither the user nor his audience is notified of the suppression of speech), deboosting, de-platforming, de-monetizing, restricting access to content, requiring users to take down content and imposing warning labels that require click-through to access the content. Facebook has allegedly inserted warning labels on posts that may have challenged the CDC\u2019s claims regarding COVID. Twitter reportedly banned contradictory voices. \u201cThis state action deprives Americans of their right to hear the views of those who are being silenced, a First Amendment corollary of the right to free speech. The government\u2019s policy of coercing social-media companies to censor plaintiffs\u2019 viewpoints should be declared unlawful and halted immediately,\u201d the NCLA press release stated. Secret documents containing top health officials conniving with Big Tech uncovered America First Legal (AFL) foundation, a public charity group, recently obtained some secret correspondences revealing that top U.S. health officials worked hand-in-hand with Big Tech to moderate content related to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Related: CDC sent Big Tech platforms \u2018instructions\u2019 on who to censor.) The documents were released back in July following a Freedom of Information Act request by the foundation. The said papers reportedly show that companies such as Twitter and Facebook were notified repeatedly by the CDC on how to moderate posts and what are to be flagged as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d One of the unearthed emails from May 2021 showed that Carol Crawford, CDC\u2019s Chief Digital of Media, sent to Twitter a list of tweets that the agency regarded as misinformation about vaccine shedding and microchips. Similarly, FB was also found coordinating with CDC as Crawford also sent Meta a list of posts containing \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Facebook gave the CDC and Department of Health and Human Services $15 million in free advertising during the pandemic. The tech company also set up a misinformation reporting channel for CDC and Census Bureau officials to report posts to FB\u2019s team. Moreover, CDC also asked Google to include its vaccine finder page at the top of search results about the vaccine, and one of the search engine\u2019s employees said they were working with the CDC to set up a \u201cQuestion Hub\u201d related to the pandemic. These explosive smoking-gun documents, obtained as a result of AFL\u2019s litigation against the Biden Administration, conclusively demonstrate that Big Tech has unlawfully colluded with the federal government to silence, censor, and suppress Americans\u2019 free speech and violate their First Amendment rights. \u201cThe government is expressly prohibited from censoring competing or dissenting viewpoints or from silencing its political opponents, whether it does so directly or whether it uses an outside corporation to achieve its draconian, totalitarian ends. AFL will not rest in the fight against illegal collusion between Big Tech and Big Government to trample on your voices and the Bill of Rights,\u201d said AFL President Stephen Miller.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) There are varying educated opinions about the true number of deaths caused by Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d worldwide. According to Steve Kirsch, a conservative estimate is around 12 million people, a figure 40 times higher than the number of Americans who died during World War II. Kirsch says a reasonable way to estimate covid jab deaths is to divide the number of doses by 1,000. Based on the 600 million doses delivered just in the United States, this amounts to 600,000 deaths, which he says \u201cis right in the ballpark.\u201d An even more conservative calculation is to divide the number of doses by 2,500. This is the method Mathew Crawford used to conclude that 411 people die per one million doses of shot administered. (Related: Remember when the medical establishment was doing everything possible to avoid autopsying the bodies of people who took covid \u201cvaccines\u201d from the likes of Pfizer?) As a type of independent peer review, Kirsch offered up a $1 million reward to anyone who is able to debunk Crawford\u2019s figure. So far, nobody has even attempted to refute it. Using Crawford\u2019s conservative estimate, the global total of covid jab deaths is around five million, or only 16 times the number of Americans killed in WWII. \u201cWe are approaching the 6M Jews killed in the Holocaust over a period of 12 years,\u201d Kirsch writes. \u201cBut we are killing people worldwide at a rate at least 6X faster than the Germans did.\u201d \u201cWe are killing nearly close to 10,000 people every single day (the latest rate was roughly 8.46 million doses a day).\u201d Fauci Flu shots are a kiss of death Since 385,000 babies are born every day, this killing spree can theoretically go on forever, Kirsch notes \u2013 even if the birth rate ends up dropping by 90 percent due to the long-term sterilizing effects of the shots. No matter how you look at it, a lot of people are dying from these things. And governments have yet to acknowledge that fact, or the fact that covid jab deaths are far higher than actual covid deaths \u2013 assuming covid is even real as the virus they claim it is. \u201cWe are killing an awful lot of people, but world leaders are looking the other way and saying nothing while all of us watch the high number of death reports in the media of people who died \u2018unexpectedly\u2019 and hear no explanation from the medical community or the CDC,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cWe are supposed to trust that they have things well in hand, even though they won\u2019t appear on camera in front of anyone who doesn\u2019t have scripted, pre-approved questions. The vaccine is never mentioned in any of these unexplained death reports.\u201d Oddly enough \u2013 or perhaps not to readers in the know \u2013 almost nobody who refused the shots is getting sick with \u201ccovid\u201d anymore. The only people falling ill or dying are those who got \u201cfully vaccinated,\u201d \u201cboosters\u201d included. \u201cThe CDC will not require medical examiners to do the proper tests to make the association,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cThey could easily do that. But they won\u2019t. That tells you everything you need to know about the corruption.\u201d \u201cSo it will be an unexplained rise in unexplained deaths due to unknown causes because nobody in the mainstream media is ever going to admit they were wrong and ask a few unscripted questions.\u201d Kirsch also believes that Donald Trump is too afraid to speak out against the jabs, which somehow explains why he repeatedly promoted them while calling himself \u201cfather of the vaccine.\u201d To learn more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of covid \u201cvaccines\u201d and other products from Pfizer, be sure to check out ChemicalViolence.com.

        "text":"(Natural News) Board-certified pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole believes that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are linked to rising cancer rates. The owner of Idaho-based medical laboratory Cole Diagnostics cited a January 2018 paper published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery to bolster his claim. The paper, written by researchers from Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, warned of a \u201cpossible concern\u201d with mRNA vaccines \u2013 including the ones for COVID-19. \u201cSome mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation, but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to take,\u201d the paper stated. Cole also cited animal trials for mRNA vaccines as evidence of their dangers. Test subjects developed \u201codd cancers\u201d and \u201cautoimmune diseases\u201d up to a year after they were injected, he added. Moreover, the pathologist\u2019s direct clinical experience also lent credence to his argument. According to Cole, he saw a dramatic increase in the number of people coming into his practice with gynecological cancers. The number of endometrial cancers he encountered rose by 20 times compared to what he typically sees on an annual basis. (Related: Mass COVID-19 vaccination is a deadly and unscientific policy that will cause surge in cancer rates, warns pathologist.) Given this, Cole interpreted this increase in cancers and autoimmune problems as caused by the COVID-19 vaccines damaging the immune system. Back in July 2021, the Idaho pathologist revealed that the COVID-19 vaccines causes catastrophic damage to human organs. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used as the main component in the vaccines was responsible for this vaccine damage, he said. \u201cThe spike protein doesn\u2019t just stay in the deltoid. [It] circulates in [the] blood and lands in multiple organs in the body,\u201d Cole said during the July 2021 White Coat Summit organized by America\u2019s Frontline Doctors. Spike protein in COVID shot driving force behind cancer Cole explained how the vaccines compromise the immune system during a January 2022 interview with Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American. He reiterated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used in the shot attacks receptors in the human cells that identify healthy cells from disease-causing ones. According to the Idaho doctor, he initially saw viral skin lesions \u2013 commonly found in children \u2013 developing in his adult patients. Following many biopsies, he noticed an upward trend in women\u2019s cancers, including endometrial and cervical cancers, among older individuals. \u201cAfter I reported those, I had tons of oncologists coming forward and saying \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m seeing the weird cancers \u2013 [those] we\u2019ve been able to keep in check and treat \u2013 taking off like wildfire,\u201d he told Kyrylenko. \u201cThat\u2019s because of the immune dysregulation that these shots cause.\u201d Cole pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccines turn off some of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human cells, compromising the immune system\u2019s alert mechanism. The deactivated receptors include TLR7 and TLR8, which detect viruses, and TLR3 and TLR4, which keep cancer in check. The spike protein also binds to different genes, including the P53 gene that suppresses tumors; the TMPRSS-2 gene linked to prostate cancer; and the BRCA genes linked to breast cancer in women. \u201cWe\u2019re giving a shot that makes a spike protein. That\u2019s a toxin that triggers cancer genes in bad ways and turns off other pattern receptors,\u201d said Cole. \u201c[It] causes the same disease as the virus and is predisposing people to auto-immune attacks and potentially short-term cancer risks.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long the immune system is suppressed after these shots and how long these receptors are shut off \u2013 because those studies aren\u2019t done,\u201d he concluded.

        "text":"The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today\u2014plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late. If the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible: The Mark of the Beast Passage Revelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) \u2014 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone \u2014small and great, rich and poor, free and slave\u2014 to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666. This passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long. It's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that. Not A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight) More importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count! Despite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that: Revelation 20:4 (HCSB) \u2014 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God\u2019s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands . This passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion. Click here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy Four Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark The first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15). The second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image\/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10). Understanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation \/ 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13). Once you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems\u2014including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.) Thus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations. But there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark. Refuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture The passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution. It points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs. (Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.) Article continues below... \"Depart From Me, I Never Knew you!\" - Jesus Jesus predicted that he will tell many sincere believers to basically \"get lost\" instead of welcoming them into the Kingdom. So...who are they and what did they miss or do wrong? In this study, get those answers and the one requirement for salvation Jesus taught (that Christianity misses) so that you can make sure you don't hear these dreaded words yourself! In summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark: The 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark Convinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture \"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal? Terrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it. Yet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking\/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)? A big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign\/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18): Exodus 13:16 (HCSB) \u2014 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand. Orthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative). But we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors\/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24). Why Only a Literal Mark Works Whenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast. This passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\" Revelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) \u2014 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels Now think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions. If the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure? Since a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand\/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it. But Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark? With that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark? This is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out: 3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes Mark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters\/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture) The first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now. Faith Needed To Obey the Warning By way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well. Similarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark. The faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive. It has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too. (Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps) No Visible Angels Another reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively. I think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men. \"My pastor said not to go\" It should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and\/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark. Then, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later). The mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2. Option 3, of mark evasion, will have expired. Why It's Not Already Here You may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple. That said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology. \"COVID Vaccines\/Passports Are the Mark!\" Along those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit: People say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666. So you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one. What Do I Think the Mark Is? Then what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society. Rev 13:17 \u2014 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. Considering that verse you can rule out a few things right off: The mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" Is trade\/bartering stopped, too?: What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark? If the mark is only an ID\/currency account, then I doubt trade\/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural\/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce. All that to say, when I consider the buying\/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast. What To Do Today To Escape the Mark Clearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions. The question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know: Luke 18:8 (HCSB)\u2014 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) \u2014 5 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201c Increase our faith .\u201d 6 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cyou can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) \u2014 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d Ever notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere. In the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it. If you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast. By the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation. What Not To Do... Lastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about. Conclusion The Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact. The proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did. For help on what aspects to focus on changing in your life, from Jesus' words, see my article on Rapture Requirements. P.S.

        "text":"We publish the below anonymously for self-evident reasons. I wrote an article for UK Column a year ago which accused legacy media newspaper proprietors of being criminally negligent for allowing Covid disinformation and fear-based propaganda in their titles. Since that time, levels of hatred have increased against journalists who operate in this industry that I myself have been part of for a quarter of a century. In this second anonymous whistleblower account of what it is like to work in UK newspapers during the Covid era, I hope to direct some of that hatred away from the journalists and to refocus it on the newspaper industry chiefs who serve Big Pharma before truth. Censorship? What censorship? Nearly all of the journalists I know are completely unaware of global censorship; they are often new in their roles and are thrust into a working world of increasingly aggressive public relations officers. One community reporter, whom I class as a friend, listened to my concerns about tech giants censoring scientists and health professionals who went against World Health Organisation guidelines for the alleged pandemic. This reporter\u2019s wages are paid for by Facebook, so I was expecting they would be aware of this, but they responded with: \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Add to this ignorance the chronic levels of understaffing we endure, with redundancies being announced most years across all editorial departments, and we have an industry where press releases are pumped out without challenge. As an example of this, I had one editor ask me to upload directly onto our newspaper website an NHS press release urging pregnant women to take the Covid injection, as it was \u201csafe and effective\u201d. This same editor was too fearful to return to the office early this year, even though others were coming back in, so I genuinely believe the editor thought the press release was nothing more than legitimate public health advice. In sum, the entire backbone has been ripped out of the news industry\u2014and that happened more than a decade ago. And we are dealing with clueless individuals who work within it, many of them programmed to be \u201cwoke\u201d by their \u201ctrusted\u201d news sources like the BBC and the Guardian, but do they deserve our hate and scorn? At the time of writing my last whistleblower account, I was angry, frustrated and scared about where the world was heading and how my industry was pushing it there. I hated my colleagues for their ignorance and their blind faith in authority. But after another year of continuing to take pay cheques from what I still believe is the PR unit for globalist billionaires, I have become sorry for these foot soldiers who have caused so much harm by failing to challenge authority. And I fear for them as well. Bewitched It won\u2019t be long before a British journalist is physically hurt (if it hasn\u2019t happened already) for their role in what has happened in the Covid era, and I have experienced some of this public hatred towards journalists myself. During a recent public meeting highlighting the documented life-changing harm and death caused by the Pfizer Covid injections, I had some audience members turn on me, shouting that I was a disgrace and that I should quit my job when I announced that I worked in the mainstream media. If it had not been for a senior local politician, who knows me, speaking up for my integrity, I would have had to have made a sharp exit for my own safety. The mainstream news has become one of the country's most hated professions during the last two years, especially among those who have either recently learned or already knew not to trust authority on global issues. Having now returned to the office on a sporadic basis, I have had the chance to speak face-to-face with colleagues for the first time in more than a year\u2014and it has dawned on me how ignorant they are. They are not stupid, they are not controlled opposition, they are not just being told what to write, they are just completely unaware of any counter-narratives about Covid. They are under a spell, a spell of remarkable simplicity that has just two elements\u2014censorship and propaganda\u2014which brings about the end product of fear. Most of my colleagues are fairly low down in the editorial structure of the global mainstream behemoth, but they represent a microcosm of what is happening further along the corridors of power. This hierarchical consideration goes some way to explain the absolute ignorance among those reporting the news. There is a handful of my colleagues who are aware that the human race is being railroaded into a new world order controlled by technocrats. A few others are starting to realise that politicians have no problems lying to us about the most important global issues. This second group, although aware of something bad happening around them, recoil at the thought of a global conspiracy to enslave humanity. When discussing Covid, especially, they make it clear they do not subscribe to conspiracy theories and are not conspiracy theorists. These comments are made because they are fearful their reputations could be harmed by discussing Covid through the lens of holding authority to account, following the money, and asking who benefits. I have noticed that mainstream media managers are far more fearful of being branded a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d than a reporter. And I know of one reporter who was branded the \u201coffice conspiracy theorist\u201d for writing an article detailing a woman\u2019s Covid injection harm. Some of my colleagues I also count as friends, and many of them I still have not seen since our offices were shut down across the country more than two years ago. But recently we have been returning to our desks\u2014which we have to book online beforehand\u2014and this has allowed me to be able to speak to some of them and to look them in the eye as I hear their thoughts about what has been going on. It has been a shocking experience, and disheartening. The propaganda pumped out by the Government, and regurgitated by the national newspapers and television news networks, has done a good job of scaring them\u2014to such an extent that real psychological trauma has been caused to some of them. Several colleagues have admitted to me they are \u201cpro-vax\u201d and are worried about any \"messaging\" that could reduce Covid injection uptake. Another just felt it was their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to receive all their injections, and thought no more about it. One colleague even messaged me to urge me to be injected, as they were so worried for my wellbeing. Some months later, I provided that colleague with evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the increased levels of death among those who did get injected, and I urged them not to continue taking any Covid boosters offered. I received no response. Cloud of unknowing More shocking examples of ignorance came from a colleague who told me how fortunate it was that a reporter we worked with had been triple injected, as they had become seriously ill with Covid. No connection between the injections and becoming ill was made. This same colleague had written an opinion piece some months earlier, pleading with people to continue taking their Covid injections, despite referencing a report of a woman dying in agony from blood clots\u2014after being injected\u2014which featured in that same day\u2019s newspaper. Is this cognitive dissonance? Mass formation? I don\u2019t pretend to know, but it is isolating and lonely to be working among these people who are so programmed by the television news. And they certainly do not like be challenged about their beliefs. I have done it, and have been victimised for it. One seasoned reporter who prided themselves on knowing the ways of the world was talking to me about the alleged pandemic. I asked them what they knew about midazolam, and they replied they had never heard of it. This censorship in the legacy media has left my colleagues and former colleagues blissfully unaware of Covid counter-narratives. Some truly believe in Bill Gates as a charitable benefactor for humanity and Chris Whitty as a responsible scientist looking to help guide the UK out of troubled waters. They are living in a different reality to myself and do not want to dip their toes in the information streams of those who disagree with them so fundamentally. As one colleague recently told me, they only get their information on global affairs from the mainstream media. I told her I didn\u2019t get any of my information on global affairs from the mainstream media. The conversation ended there. We were both so wrapped up in our own worlds that to even engage in debate with someone who thought so differently would be too uncomfortable. These types of people who build their understanding of the world from the television, radio and mainstream newspapers do not just work in the mainstream media. They exist in health, education, politics, councils, entertainment, sport, church, you name it. Whatever the sector of employment, there are people who trust those with the loudest microphones. But in the mainstream news, there are more of these people; a lot more. Careers in this industry depend on consuming other mainstream outlets: especially so at a local level, where \u201cnews sense\u201d is guided by what the national news is saying. Victims So here I am, a journalist of 25 years who has worked only in the mainstream news arena. I have been unable to wake up the vast majority of colleagues and have withdrawn into my shell, apart from occasional spats with them over e-mail or, on rare occasions, in person. I know what is going on in the world and they don\u2019t. I have been restricted from writing about what I know about, or even to ask questions of authority that my editor does not want asked. I am not giving up, though; I am not walking away. I am staying at my post, as I know things are very likely to get worse; and when things get worse, more of my colleagues will start waking up, and I\u2019ll be here to guide them and point them towards official documents that they will know nothing about, since the national newspapers and the broadcast news have chosen to ignore them. Ask a journalist about what they know about PCR test cycle rates or a SPI-B Government document recommending the use fear-based propaganda in the media to turn civilians against each other, and you will just get a blank stare. A friend consoled me recently that the way to bring down an edifice of unchecked control that operates under the power of censorship and propaganda is to set just one mouse gnawing away at the foundations. Eventually, that one mouse becomes two, and then four, then eight, and so on. That is how we get out of this mess, from the bottom of whatever corporate pyramid we operate in. There is no point in hoping for change from above: as I can tell you with absolute certainty, and experience, it is not coming. Journalists whom I work with, trust, and respect, and have known for years are just as clueless about Covid now as they were at the start of 2020. Don\u2019t hate them; feel sorry for them. They are victims in all this. I concluded my last UK Column article with a plea: a plea to those who made the editorial decisions, to allow for debate. That plea was never answered, but I make another plea now, to the reporters, to those venturing out of the office to speak to those in authority, building contacts and getting the stories. (And above all else, keep an open mind.) My plea is this: Please, please, do not be afraid of asking difficult questions, and make it your business to seek out information that is being censored and then to decide for yourself whether that information has any validity. The fight against tyranny has to come from the bottom, not the top. Don\u2019t wait for a knight in shining armour; there isn\u2019t one coming. It is up to you\u2014the coalface journalist\u2014to get out there and hold authority to account. And then, perhaps, our industry will become less hated than it is today; it could even become a profession again.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.ukcolumn.org\/video\/unvaccinated-or-unmasked-bbc-documentary-participant-speaks",
        "text":"In a fascinating and significant interview, Luca Barbarossa\u2014one of seven participants in the BBC's Unvaccinated documentary screened on 20 July 2022\u2014agreed to talk to UK Column for the first time since the programme was aired and to set the record straight about what really happened on and off camera. Luca describes his stay as like living in a \"Big Brother unvaccinated house\", complete with a diary room for the participants to offload any concerns to the production team. What was it like to live with strangers, all with different reasons for not having taken a Covid vaccine and all determined to question the narrative? A career actor since 2016, Luca Barbarossa has recently appeared in a major bank's commercial for financial compatibility matchmaking. He is refreshingly open in this interview. Luca is not, and has never been, a 'crisis actor', and had only applied to take part in the documentary to address his own concerns about Covid-19 vaccine safety, the serious side effects and the impact the injection has had on his own family. Luca reveals what impact watching the heavily-edited documentary had on him, and how he feels utterly misrepresented, ridiculed and lambasted by many on social media. He discusses having felt panic-stricken on the last day of filming when, with no forewarning given to any of the participants, they were told that they were expected to attend a vaccination centre to be asked if they would now take the vaccine. Offensive, inaccurate and inappropriate games, such as jellybean roulette to illustrate victims of myocarditis\u2014a recognised serious adverse reaction from the injection, affecting thousands of young people globally, some fatally\u2014were among the simplistic presentational techniques that Professor Hannah Fry attempted, to the horror of the participants' group. Yet the consternation runs deeper than simply stunts. Scripting, misinformation, exaggerated and incorrect data are among the problems with Unvaccinated. Scientists with huge conflicts of interest from their Big Pharma commitments were the only experts presented to the group. Luca describes the documentary process as being one-sided with no fair debate. Normally chatty and confident himself, Luca was left with the impression that others in the group were being given more opportunity to comment during the documentary because they were more insistent than he was. This led to dissension within the group; strife which Professor Hannah Fry and the production team appeared to enjoy and even encourage. Crucial conversations were edited out, such as a serious one with well-known former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, yet squabbles among the participants made the final cut. It is evident from Luca's testimony here that he is a highly-informed, passionate and confident man. He spent many hours researching the Covid vaccine issue, yet\u2014despite strongly challenging the evidence with experts presented to him by the BBC\u2014he never received any satisfactory answers. Luca admits that the whole experience has made him even more suspicious, not merely of the injection but also of scientists, academics, doctors, nurses and government. Indeed, he is far from alone: many have expressed their complete mistrust of professionals across the board, some professing that they never want to see an NHS medic or trust a Big Pharma-affiliated doctor again. What was conceived of as a candidate for a BAFTA award-winning documentary appears to have become one of the most revelatory moments in the two-year history of the Covid pandemic to date, for all the wrong reasons. Unvaccinated could perhaps more aptly have been dubbed Unveiled or Unmasked. The participants\u2014braving the BBC and navigating their way through a frankly horrific experience\u2014should be applauded for having achieved far more than their principal aim of bringing attention to serious adverse reactions and the question of whether to go for a Covid jab or not. They have done nothing short of exposing a chasm of mistrust of all experts and the media. The BBC was taken to task and failed spectacularly. The producers thought their supposedly trusted celebrity messengers would be able to persuade seven very well-read participants to go against their better judgement and offer their arms up for an experimental injection for which there is simply no long-term safety data. The BBC failed and the participants triumphed. Far from succeeding in demeaning the group, the BBC met its match and then some. Unwittingly, the BBC allowed those better informed than its own staff to ask questions that they could not answer. None of the group accepted Professor Hannah Fry's offer of a Covid jab. The participants concluded that there was no new evidence to induce confidence in the word of the BBC's experts, and Luca Barbarossa\u2014a healthy young man\u2014cannot see any point in having an injection which protects neither him nor others from the 'infection'. This is a warning that we would all do well to heed. We would like to thank Luca for his bravery and candour. His account affords invaluable insight into how the BBC works, or rather doesn't work, on the strength of its \u00a35 billion budget. Professor Hannah Fry, a prolific tweeter, has been curiously very quiet about Unvaccinated. Will this be the documentary the BBC wishes it had never aired? UK Column will be doing further work on this monumental documentary, it has opened the BBC's very own Pandora's box. Unvaccinated might be destined long to remain a thorn in the BBC's side.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.ukcolumn.org\/article\/exercise-cygnus-uk-government-exercise-justifies-covid-19-lockdown",
        "text":"It\u2019s April 2020, and since March, the UK has swiftly commissioned and built vast, temporary, intensive care hospitals, in readiness for a predicted epidemic number of severe COVID-19 cases. They are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals, and to date there are seven of them, either open or planned. The first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre. It has a capacity of some 4,000 beds. The other temporary field hospital sites are in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, and Washington. Additionally, over the last month, some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use, along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK. By the beginning of April, one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients. Yet, by 12 April, the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients, and to date, only 41 patients have been treated. This sudden blitz is both unusual and unprecedented. We regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population; in fact in recent years, some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance. Yet no new mega-hospitals, temporary or otherwise, were ever built to cope with them, nor were they seen to be needed. Why now? According to the King\u2019s Fund, over the last thirty years, the number of ICU beds has declined, at a time when the population has risen. Over that period, around 34% of general and critical care beds in England have been lost. Peter Donaghy, an independent data analyst, reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population: in 2019, and across the four UK nations, he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [interpolation of his figures mine]. Cyprus has double that number, Germany has 29, the USA 34, and even Kazakhstan and Mongolia do better than the UK. Bed shortages are not news, however. In 2008, it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997, when, ironically, the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds. Between 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK: In 2016, the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages, so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89%, when 85% is considered the maximum safe level. This complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in, reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries, and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections. And in 2018, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) astonishingly reported that across the UK, 80% of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals, either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff, particularly nurses. To cap things off, by 2019, it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations, and that when more emergency beds were needed, a policy of \u201cescalation beds\u201d came into force. The BMA drily reported that there was \u201clittle sign of this practice ending\u201d. When one thinks of the NHS, intensive care is at the heart of most people\u2019s perceptions of it. Yet the decline in the number of ICU beds over the last 30 years is so counterintuitive that it\u2019s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import, but that intensive care beds are even more expendable. But whatever the case, in the event of a mass epidemic, the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020. What official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds? To get a general feel, looking back to 2011, the government published the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper, outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be. This paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Its precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic, which could occur suddenly at any time: must be evidence based be proportional to the level of threat be flexible be based on ethical principles. emergency powers must last no longer than 30 days Significantly, it states that during any pandemic, it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and notes that its recommendations are in line with an earlier, 2007, National Framework paper\u2019s \u201cdefence in depth\u201d approach to a pandemic. The Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic, but must remain on their normal defence duties. So of course, this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals, transport patients, or manage the public. Military convoy off the coast at Devonport on the morning of 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown In fact, the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies; it takes it as read that there would be enough UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients \u2013 for in 2009\u2019s H1N1 swine flu outbreak, generally, hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients. There were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England, and 138 fatalities at the time, or 0.026% of those infected. Exercise Cygnus Following the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper, however, the number of ICU beds continued to fall. Then, five years later, government held an unusual and secretive event called Exercise Cygnus. It involved all government departments, all local authorities, and the NHS, right across the UK. Its report has not been published for \u201cnational security reasons\u201d and so as not to \u201cfrighten the public\u201d. However, according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation, Cygnus\u2019 script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment. Based on its given hypotheses, it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required, large parts of the NHS would need to be switched off to redeploy staff, frail patients would be denied care, and mortuaries would be overwhelmed. Was this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other, like some kind of Grand Guignol? Did the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony, in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds, in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital, were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs? The modelling of Cygnus was done by Imperial College, London, under the aegis of Neil Ferguson, who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19. Tellingly, it is said that last month\u2019s Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown, is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus. Ferguson\u2019s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions \u2013 for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley\u2019s article: Who controls the British Government response to Covid\u201319? Outside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages. So why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries? The Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt. Simon Stevens was Chief of NHS England. Both had been involved in cutting bed numbers. Yet, since 2016, and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm, there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity. Following Exercise Cygnus, in 2017, the NHS Board published a short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR). Its approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament: the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), the NHS Act (2006), and the Health and Social Care Act (2012). Drawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board, Matthew Swindells (sic), it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year, and that the NHS was in a state of pandemic readiness. EPRR was rubber stamped, but as we have seen above, the somewhat rosy, self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017, and later, by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018, the BMA in 2019, and Peter Donaghy in 2020. Back to Exercise Cygnus. This was supposed to be merely a computer simulation. So why would it be an issue of \u201cnational security\u201d? Why would it \u201cfrighten the public\u201d? Perhaps because it was intended to change the real world into its simulated image? It\u2019s an uncanny coincidence that, after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared, it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment, that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas, that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d orders, and large, temporary, mortuaries have also been built up and down the country, just as in the simulation. Temporary mortuary set up in Ernesettle Fort, Plymouth Since the first reported UK Covid-19 case, there has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths, and its threat. All the while, there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty, that beds of other sorts are empty, and that although accident and emergency visits are down, people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number, are being told to \u201cStay at home \u2013 Save the NHS \u2013 Save Lives\u201d. Many of these callers have then died for lack of care. It has also emerged that standards in death registration have been lowered by the government, and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies, of any underlying condition, as a Covid-19 death. There need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it. Despite these efforts to inflate the death rate, actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS's depleted intensive care units. In that regard, Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus\u2019 computer-generated scenario. The government response, however, seems to match it exactly.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.ukcolumn.org\/blogs\/back-to-the-past-a-reemergence-of-victorian-diseases",
        "text":"On Wednesday 22 June 2022, the United Kingdom declared a national incident after vaccine-induced poliovirus was found in sewage samples in North and East London. Wild polio currently exists in only two countries\u2014Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2014and was declared eradicated in the UK in 2003. We are told that positive sewage tests have been found since February 2022, which would suggest that scientists are looking at a hypothesis of \u2018ongoing transmission\u2019 around the country. But is polio the only unusual virus detected in the UK in the last six months, and was it entirely unexpected? Is it sheer coincidence that our very own MHRA is collaborating with the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication Initiative and houses its polio laboratory at the heart of Britain's medicines regulation complex, at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? Not surprising The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), in a March 2019 blog post written when the agency was still designated as Public Health England, warned that a resurgence of Victorian diseases was expected\u2014and that is exactly what we appear to be seeing now, according to current press releases. Professor Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, describes what we are seeing as \u2018chatter\u2019. \u2018Chatter\u2019 is the term regularly used by counter-terrorist officers (a not insignificant context, given that the UKHSA\u2019s new name combines the concepts of public health and national security) to describe the small signals that may signify some more major calamity on the horizon. Infectious disease prevention works in much the same way as counter-terrorism. Currently, we are being alerted that \u2018chatter\u2019 is getting louder; perhaps this increased volume stems from the heightened awareness of the risks since Covid-19. Even though we have seen the world strengthen its security systems, the world\u2019s best-known public health official, Professor Anthony Fauci, warns of a new \u2018pandemic era\u2019. Scabies, rickets, scarlet fever, whooping cough, tuberculosis and typhoid fever, amongst others, are returning to Western nations\u2014but not as we remember them. Some of these old terrors will return with a vengeance, as a new variant or strain. Will our old-fashioned belt-and-braces medications that we have come to rely on for so long be effective, if they even prove to be widely available? What is driving the spread of new, old and existing viruses\u2014or is it simply that we are searching every corner of the planet expecting to track down the next pandemic\u2014a case of seek and ye shall find? Perhaps we should brace ourselves, as the blame for resurgent infections is likely to be attributed in public discourse to a variety of reasons: climate change, population growth, rainforest destruction, intense farming, the increased trade in wildlife combined with the exponential rise in zoonotic disease. As the United Kingdom has been extricating itself from the European Union, non-EU immigration has increased, with large numbers of people travelling to and from Africa and Asia. Despite a couple of years of draconian travel restrictions and Covid lock-ups (sic), travel is still always named as the biggest driver of disease importations. The recent outbreak of monkeypox has been linked to Nigeria, with many more cases attributed to music festivals, adult saunas and orgies around the world. The 2022 British polio outbreak is thought to have been derived from another country, one which still uses a vaccine containing a live weakened strain of the polio virus; this is why the health authorities are describing the strain of poliovirus that they have detected in London as \u2018vaccine-derived\u2019. The UK itself has not used this particular vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, since 2004; we have reverted to the injectable Salk vaccine for our polio immunisations. Many would care to argue that polio has been given the perfect opportunity to reappear due to the Covid-19 pandemic, because of increased vaccine hesitancy and a major shift towards funding Covid-19 campaigns at the expense of other precious public health resources. Furthermore, disruptions to normal childhood immunisation schedules due to lock-ups, and a failure to provide face-to-face appointments with health professionals, will no doubt have contributed to the opportunity for polio. In the UK, vaccine administration to children has decreased in the past couple of years, especially in parts of London. Over-informed Pharmaceutical research is currently travelling at a million miles an hour, with \u2018information cascades\u2019 bubbling with details of the thousands of novel drugs currently in development. This massive volume of information is designed to confuse and overwhelm the general population. As genomic medicines travel down the brand new experimental pipeline at the speed of light, many will relax and participate in clinical trials from the comfort of their armchairs, and millions will come to expect and to rely on brand new drugs which will be delivered in record speed to their door (probably by drone). The norm will be a much shorter delay between demand and delivery. The 100 Days Mission announced by Britain, the vision of Sir Patrick Vallance and Melinda Gates, would appear to be the answer. To put that into context, until 2020 a clinical trial would take years in three back-to-back phases, up to a timescale of 3,652 days. The first Covid vaccine was delivered in 300 days. Generic medicines that the majority of us are used to will start to disappear from pharmacy shelves. Novel \u2018super-smart\u2019 genomic medicines will replace them at alarming speed\u2014but at what cost to our health? Does anyone supplying them actually care? Looking at the serious adverse reactions thus far, it seems not. The new buzzphrase that we will have to get used to will be antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Fortunately for Britain, we have our very own UK Envoy for AMR, in the form of Dame Sally Davies, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge\u2014England\u2019s previous Chief Medical Officer, who was responsible for Generation Genome. What is AMR anyway, and should we be concerned? According to the World Health Organisation, AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of severe illness and death. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial therapies become ineffective, making infectious diseases impossible to treat. The world has neglected to research new antibiotics. Is that an oversight or a deliberate omission at a high level? With no new antibiotics riding to our rescue in this heralded pandemic era, many will find themselves reliant on new experimental heavy-duty cocktails. Those wishing to opt out of the new pharmaceutical armoury that is offered to them will undoubtedly move away from allopathic medicine entirely and opt for alternative naturopathic remedies. New variants of concern, mutants and more virulent viruses will call for super-smart medicine\u2014but not necessarily super-smart patients or super-smart medics. But ultimately, where does that leave us all? What to expect next\u2014Marburg, polio, typhoid, Ebola, Nipah, or perhaps a combination of several? Could we be about to see the elusive Disease X that experts have been warning of? Time will tell. Pandemics create panic and pandemonium; they can even open Pandora\u2019s box.",

        "text":"As bad as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 sickness it causes are, warning cries are increasing over a much bigger threat with the potential to kill 90% of the U.S. population. And, unlike the virus, Washington has known of the threat for decades and done little to nothing. \u201cWe have seen this movie before and are living through it now,\u201d said Peter Pry, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on electromagnetic pulse, the electric grid killer that threatens naturally from the sun and from weapons held by China. \u201cIf we are not even prepared for the coronavirus, imagine the consequences if we get hit with a real existential threat, like EMP,\u201d he said. Advocates for protecting the nation\u2019s electric grid and other vital systems, including military bases, from an EMP attack are seizing on the virus crisis to inject urgency into budgeting to protect electric transformers, transfer stations, and wires from disruption or meltdown. \u201cFor the $2 trillion that will be spent on the coronavirus, we could harden all critical infrastructures against EMP, deploy space-based missile defense Brilliant Pebbles before the end of a second Trump term, modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent from top to bottom (delivery vehicles, weapons, scientific-industrial base), and have over $1 trillion to spare,\u201d said Pry, a key member of congressional EMP commissions and author of the new book The Power and the Light: The Congressional EMP Commission\u2019s War to Save America 2001 \u2013 2020. Brian Sullivan, a government and military security analyst, said, \u201cCan you imagine if our grid went down and we lost electricity for an extended period of time? As bad as our current situation is, it could always be a lot worse. We relied on our government leaders to prepare our country for a pandemic, and we see what that got us. We rely on that same leadership now to protect our electric grid.\u201d While warnings of the current pandemic have been around for less than a year, reports have been written about EMP attacks for decades. The first congressional EMP panel, for example, warned of a yearlong blackout following an attack on the electric grid. \u201cThe EMP Commission estimates a nationwide blackout of the United States lasting one year could kill 90% of Americans from starvation and societal collapse,\u201d said Pry. That would be about 295 million people. In the past, warnings have been met inside the government and energy industry with eye-rolling. But President Trump has taken the threat seriously, especially as China and other foes have developed EMP weapons, and signed an executive order to move toward protecting the grid. The military has also taken steps to protect its operations. But Pry details in his new book the efforts inside the \u201cdeep state\u201d federal bureaucracy and electric industry to \u201cslow-roll and sabotage\u201d Trump\u2019s agenda while making it look like they\u2019re making progress. \u201cThe strategy of pretending to do something but really doing nothing and then throwing money at the threat when it happens will get millions of Americans killed when there is an EMP,\u201d he told Secrets.",

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain. That work has been underway and the next step is for the FDA and CDC to review data from the companies, once they\u2019ve received it. The rollout was expected sometime in September, but Jha\u2019s estimate on Tuesday was the most specific to date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to know more about this in the upcoming weeks and these vaccines will become available by early to mid-September,\u201d Jha said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, again including the caveat that FDA and CDC need to act before anything can be official. \u201cBut the big picture, bottom line, is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd those vaccines are coming very, very soon.\u201d So far the U.S. has contracted for 105 million doses of the newly-updated boosters from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna, the two leading COVID vaccine manufacturers for the country. Both contracts with Pfizer and Moderna include an option for hundreds of millions of more doses down the line, should the U.S. secure the money. Between Pfizer and Moderna, if both companies were able to complete their orders, the U.S. would have about 171 million doses of the new shots. But more than 260 million Americans have had at least one vaccine dose already and would theoretically consider getting a booster. (Source.) The problem is that those who want COVID-19 vaccines are a dwindling market, partly because millions of people in the U.S. have now been crippled or have died after taking the vaccines for the past 20 months, according to the CDC and FDA\u2019s own statistics in the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS). There are more deaths and injuries following emergency-use authorized experimental COVID-19 vaccines in 20 months than have been recorded in VAERS for the previous 30 years following all FDA-approved vaccines. That\u2019s not a very good repeat business model, when so many of your patients are dying and becoming crippled. And it is estimated that only 1% of all vaccine injuries and deaths are reported to VAERS, which would put the number of Americans injured by a COVID-19 vaccine at around 138 million, with around 3 million deaths. The ABC report acknowledged that this is a dwindling market: \u2026 demand for boosters has dropped with each campaign for people to get another shot. About 108 million people have received their first booster shot, for example. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCOVID Data Tracker,\u201d 261,981,618 people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 107,872,738 people have received a first booster, and only 35,200,364 have received a second booster. This is a diminishing market, and I am quite sure that the majority of the 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses will probably never be used. Millions of doses of previous COVID vaccines have already been discarded due to lack of demand and exceeding their expiration dates, but that has not stopped Pfizer and Moderna from recording record profits, even when their vaccines don\u2019t sell and are thrown away. While new polls show flatlining concern about the pandemic among Americans, Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine business continues quietly churning in the background. But amid a recent decline in vaccine demand, the company has written off a sizable chunk of inventory. In its second-quarter results announcement, Moderna said it wrote off $499 million in inventories \u201crelated to COVID-19 products that have exceeded or are expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\u201d In addition, the company took a $184 million charge because of changes in prior purchase commitments, and it recorded an expense of $131 million for \u201cunutilized external manufacturing capacity.\u201d (Source.) Reducing the Population of the Earth is the Goal So why would Big Pharma continue with a product that is killing and injuring so many people, and significantly reducing their market among the pro-vaxxers? The answer, which should be obvious to all by now, at least for those who have refused the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d and can still think for themselves, is that this is part of a global plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d from climate change. Along with reducing the world\u2019s population is a plan that is currently in place, and can especially be seen in Holland right now, to dramatically reduce the world food production as well. Bill Gates is the Billionaire Globalist who has been pushing this agenda for decades now, and a report published in ZeroHedge News today also identifies Bill Gates as the primary influence behind the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d that was just recently put into law. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 which according to the Congressional Budget Office will raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $20 billion \u2013 not to mention unleash an army of IRS agents on working class Americans over the next decade, was made possible by Bill Gates and (in smaller part) Larry Summers, who have been known to hang out together. Pals hanging out The bill, of course, was signed yesterday. This is what dementia looks like: pic.twitter.com\/e9fof5l4RS \u2014 End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) August 16, 2022 In a Tuesday Bloomberg article that reads more like a newsletter for the Gates fan club, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder recalls how earlier this year, as moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema continued to block the tax-and-spend legislation over concerns that it would raise taxes on the middle class (it will), Gates says he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d been cultivating since at least 2019. Gates was banking on more than just his trademark optimism about addressing climate change and other seemingly intractable problems that have been his focus since stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive two decades ago. As he revealed to Bloomberg Green, he has quietly lobbied Manchin and other senators, starting before President Joe Biden had won the White House, in anticipation of a rare moment in which heavy federal spending might be secured for the clean-energy transition. Those discussions gave him reason to believe the senator from West Virginia would come through for the climate \u2014 and he was willing to continue pressing the case himself until the very end. \u201cThe last month people felt like, OK, we tried, we\u2019re done, it failed,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI believed it was a unique opportunity.\u201d So he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d cultivated for at least three years. \u201cWe were able to talk even at a time when he felt people weren\u2019t listening.\u201d -Bloomberg We know, gag us with a spoon. Apparently Gates and Manchin\u2019s bromance began when the billionaire wooed the West Virgina Senator at a 2019 meal in Seattle, in an effort to garner support for clean-energy policy. Manchin at the time was the senior-most Democrat on the energy committee. \u201cMy dialogue with Joe has been going on for quite a while,\u201d said Gates. After Manchin walked (again) on the bill last December over concerns that it would exacerbate the national debt, inflation, the pandemic, and amid geopolitical uncertainty with Russia, Gates jumped into action. A few weeks later, he met with Manchin and his wife, Gayle Conelly Manchin, at a DC restaurant, where they talked about what West Virginia needed. Manchin understandably wanted to preserve jobs at the center of the US coal industry, while Gates suggested that coal plant workers could simply swap over to nuclear plants \u2013 such as those from Gates\u2019 TerraPower. Manchin apparently wasn\u2019t convinced, announcing on Feb. 1 that \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d (the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s previous iteration) was \u201cdead.\u201d In an effort to convince him otherwise, Democrats pulled together a cadre of economists and other Manchin influencers \u2013 including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who convinced Manchin that the bill wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, or add to the deficit. Collin O\u2019Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation, recruited economists to assuage Manchin\u2019s concerns \u2014 including representatives from the University of Chicago and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware brought in a heavyweight: former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who has spent decades advising Democrats. The economists were able to \u201csend this signal that [the bill\u2019s] going to help with the deficit,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slightly deflationary and it\u2019s going to spur growth and investment in all these areas.\u201d Through this subtle alchemy, clean-energy investments could be reframed for Manchin as a hedge against future spikes in oil and gas prices and a way to potentially export more energy to Europe. -Bloomberg Gates also sprang into action again on July 7, when Manchin was spotted at the Sun Valley media conference in Idaho \u2013 which Gates also attended. \u201cWe had a talk about what was missing, what needed to be done,\u201d Gates said. \u201cAnd then after that it was a lot of phone calls.\u201d Gates looks back at the new law with satisfaction. He achieved what he set out to do. \u201cI will say that it\u2019s one of the happier moments of my climate work,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI have two things that excite me about climate work. One is when policy gets done well, and this is by far the biggest moment like that.\u201d His other pleasure comes from interviewing people at climate and clean-tech startups: \u201cI hear about this amazing new way to make steel, cement and chemicals.\u201d -Bloomberg \u201cI don\u2019t want to take credit for what went on,\u201d says Gates \u2013 in the article about how he gets credit for what went on.

        "text":"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The biggest lie that has been perpetrated in modern medicine is that \u201cthe science is settled\u201d when it comes to the issue of vaccines, and that all vaccines are \u201csafe and effective.\u201d We have been exposing this lie for over a decade now, combating the lies with REAL data and truth, such as comparing the health outcomes of children whose parents followed the CDC vaccine schedule and injected their children with all the recommended vaccines, with those parents who decided to not vaccinate their children. This is, by far, the most scientific way to determine if vaccines, ANY vaccine, is \u201csafe and effective.\u201d But such studies have never been conducted by the federal government and their alphabet \u201chealth\u201d agencies such as the FDA, CDC, NIH, etc. And when others privately conduct such studies, these federal bureaucratic medical tyrants do everything they can to discredit and vilify those conducting such studies, to prevent the public from having this information. Here are some previous articles we have published on this topic: Families who suffer from vaccine injuries to their children, and as a result then decide to not vaccinate future children that they have, also become homes in which the health outcomes of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children can be observed. So it should not surprise us at all that the current medical authorities have no desire whatsoever to compare the health outcomes of people who have been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccines with those who have not. This is information that they do NOT want to be disseminated to the public. Steve Kirsch has just published a very revealing article about two groups of people he has studied that contain both people vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines and those who were not, comprising a sample of about 800 people, 200 of which attended a wedding about 8 months ago, and about 600 people who responded to a survey he published. The results of his analysis: In the year after you are vaccinated with the COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d you are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die expect at least a 7% rate of serious injury and a 2% chance of death It is this kind of data the CDC and FDA do NOT want disseminated to the public, and is being heavily censored. You are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die if you get the COVID shot When you combine this result with negative vaccine efficacy, the COVID shots are completely nonsensical. Nobody should take them. We couldn\u2019t find a single supportive anecdote! by Steve Kirsch Substack Executive summary I recently learned about conservative radio show host Wayne Root\u2019s stunning anecdotal evidence about the 200 people who attended his wedding. He tracked what happened just 8 months after the wedding: 26 were injured and 7 died in the vaccinated group but nothing happened to people in the unvaccinated group, even though Wayne estimated that most of the guests were unvaccinated. I loved the setup: it\u2019s an almost \u201cas good as it gets real-life randomized trial.\u201d A single anecdote isn\u2019t compelling. What is compelling is that others are observing the same huge event rates. Wayne is hardly an outlier. And the fact we can\u2019t seem to find any stories equally extreme on the opposite side has got to be very troubling for those supporting the \u201csafe and effective\u201d narrative. This is the type of post-marketing research the CDC should be doing: they should follow matched (or randomly selected) groups of vaxxed and unvaxxed people over time to document injuries and deaths just like Wayne did. If Wayne can do this, why can\u2019t the CDC? The signal is huge. Since none of Wayne\u2019s friends died pre-vaccine (Wayne is 61), this suggests that hypotheses such as this one are consistent with what Wayne observed: In the year after you are vaccinated with the COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d you are 25X more likely to be injured and 20X more likely to die expect at least a 7% rate of serious injury and a 2% chance of death would be consistent with Wayne\u2019s observations. I validated that Wayne\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t just a fluke with surveys of my reader base. Over 600 readers responded and the numbers were very similar: 21 injuries and 5 deaths per 100 vaccinated, which is very close to the numbers reported by Wayne (assuming he had an even mix of vaxxed\/unvaxxed guests). An article on The Expose just claimed that 1 in every 246 Vaccinated People has died within 60 days of Covid-19 Vaccination in England according to the UK Government which is a factor of 5 lower than my hypothesis, but that\u2019s just limited to the first 60 days after a single dose. And then I went even further looking for anecdotal evidence that Wayne was wrong. I asked my 50,000 followers on Gab for opposite anecdotes. None of the 372 people had an anecdote supporting use of the vaccine. Stunning. When you combine this with the evidence of negative vaccine efficacy (VE), such as this article on San Diego by my good friend Mathew Crawford, we are left with the inevitable conclusion that there isn\u2019t any benefit at all in any dimension to support the use of the COVID \u201cvaccines.\u201d I invite all fact checkers to: Verify my data. The survey data, including the full contact info for each of the 600 respondents, is available for any fact checker to verify. Do their own survey. Mine was done in full public view. Explain why nobody I asked knew of any positive anecdotes. When you combine all of this with the fact that The COVID vaccines kill people at a rate that is 1,000X times higher than the Smallpox vaccine (which is deemed too unsafe to use), it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that the \u201cvaccines\u201d should be stopped immediately.

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Another 142 new cases of COVID-19 vaccine injuries to babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old were added to the U.S. Government run VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reported System) database today, bringing the total number of cases filed for this age group to 829 since the shots were authorized by the FDA a few weeks ago in June. (Source.) I have put all new 142 cases that came out today on a separate page you can view here. Brain and heart injuries, hallucinations, anaphylactic shock, seizures, skin rashes, gastrointestinal injuries, hemorrhaging, and other serious conditions continue to be listed as side effects to these toxic shots being injected into babies and toddlers. One of the most tragic things I am reading in these write-ups of vaccine injuries in these babies is that the parents and medical professionals are giving them acetaminophen (sold usually as Tylenol or Paracetamol) which study after study has shown is toxic and harmful to children. See: Here are a few cases showing how these poor children are suffering after receiving the shots. VAERS ID: 2397717, 2-year-old boy in Arizona: Life threatening episode requiring emergency transport: clammy skin and vomiting leading (8 minutes) to difficulty breathing (wheezing and flared nostrils-2 minutes). Turned blue, limp, non-responsive. Fully stopped breathing for two minutes. After several chest compressions started breathing again, rolled over, and threw up. VAERS ID: 2399256, 6-month-old boy in Virginia: (NOTE: In addition to the Pfizer COVID Shot, this poor baby also got at least 5 other vaccines injected into him at the same time!!) 07\/29\/2022 In the morning we had the vaccination and it was his six month check in. He also received other multiple vaccinations that day as well. We did notice spotting in his bowel movement of blood and there was one at 4 that evening. Another bowel movement at 7 that had much more blood in comparison. A third bowel movement around 12 that evening and the blood spots reduced as well. When we looked up his other vaccines and their symptoms they did state that it may have been a different vaccine\u201ds. The doctor stated that they believe the symptoms may be caused by lactose intolerance. Check-up in two weeks to see improvements. VAERS ID: 2393082, 4-year-old girl in Maine: 07\/25\/2020 Around 2:00 AM she woke up with a fever of 102 or 103 degree and vomiting. She slept until around 9:00 in the morning and still had a fever. I gave her acetaminophen. Throughout that day I treated her fever with Tylenol. Her temperature peaked that afternoon at 104 degrees. Tylenol made her fever go down. She woke up several times during the night. Around 1230am, she was hallucinating and very confused saying things that did not make sense. The next day she woke up around 7:30am. She also complained of neck pain. I gave her more Tylenol. I switched to Motrin around noon and that seemed to bring her fever down better. She went to her pediatrician\u201ds office that afternoon and was given a COVID test which was negative. Her doctor said everything looked good. Around 4 o\u201dclock her fever went up to 104 again. Her fever does respond to Tylenol and Motrin. She woke up this morning at 03:30 and had a temperature of 105.5. I gave her Motrin, put a cool washcloth on her. When she woke up at 7:30am this morning her temperature was at 100.4 and she appears to feel better, but am not sure if she is just responding to the medication. VAERS ID: 2393330, 4-year-old boy in Oklahoma: Child received COVID vaccine in Health department clinic on 07\/25\/22. Phone all from mom on 07\/27\/22 to report seizure on 07\/26\/22 at 7:00 am. Child transport to Hospital by ambulance. Temp was 100 upon arrival. Child spent the night at the hospital for \u201cmonitoring\u201d per mom. Per mom DX with \u201ccomplex febrile seizure\u201d. Mom called to report to health department . VAERS ID: 2393754, 10-month old girl in Maryland: Mother reported child had been crawling and pulling to stand for several weeks. Mother noticed in the evening of 7\/25\/2022 about 6 hours after vaccination child\u201ds mobility changed: crawled a few feet then just stopped crawling, flopped, spread her arms and legs out across the floor. She became inactive for a minute; then continued crawling, pulled to stand and then bear weight. Mother reported no fever no signs of discomfort but is concerned about possible neurological problems in her otherwise healthy child. Mother reports normal growth and development. Family is new to the area. They have an established MD. Will follow-up with an appointment 7\/28\/2022. VAERS ID: 2397646, 2-year-old girl in Pennsylvania: Suspected febrile seizure, fever, vomiting, spasms of muscles and then sever shaking\/chills for approximately 15 minutes. Transported to hospital by ambulance at approximately 1am. Discharged at 5:30am after monitoring. VAERS ID: 2399319, 2-year-old boy in Maryland: On July 31 about 49 hours after his second dose around 3pm, patient became very lethargic and started crying. We took his temperature and he had a 104.6. We gave him ibuprofen and put him down for a nap. He slept and when he woke up he had a 102. We gave him Tylenol at that time around 6:45pm. He seemed better and was okay the rest of the evening. Before bed he had a temp of 101 so we gave him ibuprofen. He slept about 13 hours. When he woke up on August 1, he was completely inconsolable. He had a 104.3 temp. He didn\u201dt want to eat but I was able to get him to eat a few pretzels. I gave him ibuprofen in the morning when he woke up after eating around 11:30am. He was inconsolable a lot of the day and only wanted to watch TV. He ate a very small lunch. I gave him tylenol at that point. His temp was better at 100. After his nap he was crying and didn\u201dt want a snack. We went for a walk outside in his stroller and that seemed to help a little. He did eat some dinner but would cry on and off throughout dinner. After dinner, he took a bath and he seemed okay then and the rest of the evening. Before bed, his temp was normal at 98.7. We gave him ibuprofen at that time. He slept 11 hours overnight and when he woke up on August 2nd, he was fussing but not hysterical. His temp in the morning was 99.1 but he started to feel warmer as the day went on. He had a smaller than normal breakfast and a very small lunch. He was crying on and off during lunch. I took his temp again and around 2:30 it was 102. I gave him ibuprofen around 2:30 and put him down for a nap. Overall, hes been better today (August 2) but is not back to normal. He did get bit by a goat on July 31 around 1:30. When I called my pediatrician, they didn\u201dt think his fever was related. They did prescribe him augmentin which he has been taking since August 1st VAERS ID: 2399458, 4-year-old boy in Pennsylvania: 4 days after vaccine patient developed acute ataxia. He was seen at Hospital and had an MRI that was read as normal. He was diagnosed with Cerebellar inflammation. VAERS ID: 2401711, 4-year-old boy in Indiana: This is part 2 to a previous report . My son spent 4 days in hospital was a fever and tachycardia. He is 4 years old about 33lbs and at times his heart rate was above 180. He had 4 days of fever and high heart rate. His second vaccination was on 7\/29\/2022. We went to ER first on 7\/ 30\/10\/22 he was treated for fever and giving Ibuprofen and heart rate monitored and then released: the very next day 7\/31\/2022 we had to go back to hospital due to fever (103) at hospital and high heart rate over 180. He was given ibuprofen, saline because he was not drinking much at that time duration of an hour and yet his heart rate did not decrease enough for discharge and he was admitted after 2:00am on 8\/1\/2022. He had several fevers between 8\/1\/2022-8\/2\/2022 and his heart rate slowly decreased but was still high and they continued to treat with ibuprofen and Tylenol interchangeably for fevers and monitor hear rate, he was given saline on 8\/2\/2022 after labs show n he had ketones in his urine from dehydration ( he was eating solids foods Or drinking water during this time. He was taken off of the saline on 8\/3\/2022 but still struggle to eat, fevers finally subsided and heart rate appeared to stabilize but his eating and drinking was still impacted and was kept an additional day for monitoring. He was released on 8\/5\/022 with recommendations to follow up with cardiologist and primary care doctor. Both were contacted. He saw pcp on 8\/4\/2022 and awaiting follow up appointment with cardiology to be scheduled by that office. COVID-19 Vaccines are Biggest Scam in History of Medicine, and the Children Suffer the Most As we have been reporting frequently for the past few weeks, many pro-vaccine and pro-pharma doctors and scientists are coming forward to sound the alarm on just how horrible these COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d are, and the death and carnage that has followed. A video has surfaced in the alternative media featuring an Israeli Professor, Dr. Zvika Granot, Ph.D., who is on the Faculty of Medicine at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He heads up the Granot Lab as the \u201cPrincipal Investigator,\u201d focusing on \u201cneutrophils\u201d and cancer research. He is also a member of The Public Emergency Council For The Covid19 Crisis in Israel, which is where this video apparently originated. Dr. Granot states: We have already seen many distortions of science, lies and half-truths during the COVID crisis. More than once we have seen aggressive policies based on hopes that lack a scientific basis presented to the public as scientific facts. We have seen how economic and political entities presented distorted science and silence many scientists who think differently. Approving vaccination for babies and toddlers by the FDA in the USA and by the Ministry of Health in Israel, breaks all records of the theater of the absurd and raises deep doubts about the conduct of the regulators in the USA and Israel. We have uploaded the video to our Bitchute, Odysee, and Telegram channels. CDC Backtracks on COVID Measures Less Than 2 Months After Recommending COVID Shots for Babies and Toddlers The truly tragic thing about this corruption within the FDA and the CDC, is that yesterday the CDC finally backtracked on many of their COVID-19 measures that are recommended, stating that the focus should now be on \u201cindividual decisions,\u201d and that \u201cunvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people.\u201d And, just like that, it was over. This is HUGE news folks. In Bureaucrat speak, this is a near-complete cave-in to the actual facts. No symptoms? No problem. Vaccinated or unvaccinated? Same guidance. Exposed? No need to even quarantine. Students exposed? They can stay in class, what the hell, right? If you managed to maintain your integrity through this awful period of time, congratulations! You are one of the rock stars of this story. You are a solid individual who has courage and stood firm and tall when it mattered most. As for the people who didn\u2019t, some can be forgiven. But many cannot. Those who could have and \u201cshould\u201d have known better? The doctors who failed to utilize known and proven early treatments to save lives? The public health authorities that locked people down and forced masks onto children\u2019s faces without a shred of supporting science to back those decisions? Medical hospital administrators who took the monetary bait and forced patients onto toxic and deadly regimens of Remdesivir and ventilators (again, without any supporting evidence!). The NIH treatment panel that still \u2013 to this day \u2013 does not recommend vitamin D, or any of the other actual safe and effective early treatments? Sorry, not sorry, those people need to suffer real and lasting public consequences. Some doctors should lose their licenses. Some bureaucrats need to lose their jobs while others need to go to trial. I feel most acutely for those who got caught up and suffered terribly as a result. I feel truly awful for all the people prevented from being at a loved one\u2019s passing, or who ,as a condition of continued employment, were coerced into getting Covid jabs they neither wanted nor needed. There are far too many tragic cases out there. Far too many young lives were lost and continue to be lost. I am angry that it happened and at the petty, ignorant bureaucrats who forced it to happen. \u201cSudden Adult Death Syndrome\u201d is a thing now, and the attempts to normalize it by the press have left me thinking that those companies and journalists who engaged in this ought to be barred for life from ever being in the business again. (Full article.) The statement \u201cunvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people,\u201d is, of course, a meaningless statement, because those unvaccinated with COVID shots (like myself), are unvaccinated specifically because we don\u2019t follow CDC \u201cguidance\u201d to begin with, but know how to research and think for ourselves. Why the CDC has done this about face is probably a matter of pure speculation, but I think the sheer number of pro-pharma and pro-vaccine doctors and scientists that have come forward in the public these past few weeks, must be a big part of it. Without these medical professionals on board, there is no one left to implement more COVID measures. This especially came to a head last month when LA County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brad Spellberg went public to humiliate Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer\u2019s announcement that COVID-19 cases were on the rise and new face mask mandates were needed soon. See: Without the support of the medical professionals still working in the hospitals, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer backed down on more mandates. See: And remember, it was the former head of the FDA under Donald Trump, who now sits on the board of directors for Pfizer and is a talking head \u201cexpert\u201d for CNBC, who addressed the public earlier this year back in February to explain why it was taking so long for Pfizer to come up with a COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d for young children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old: The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s plan to fast-track Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine for children under 5 years old was delayed because of a \u201clow number of cases overall in the clinical trial,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Monday. \u201cMost kids are not getting symptomatic Covid,\u201d said the current Pfizer board member and former head of the FDA. \u201cOne case in one direction or another can tip the perception of the vaccine\u2019s overall effectiveness.\u201d (Full article.) In other words, there just were not enough sick kids with COVID symptoms to complete the trials. But they ended up putting this product into the market in June anyway, and now the CDC is saying that unvaccinated people should be treated the same as vaccinated, after untold numbers of deaths and injuries, not to mention massive loss of employment due to the COVID-19 vaccine mandates, many of which are still in place. People need to be tried, convicted, and executed over this. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.

        "text":"How the Monkeypox Scam Mirrors the COVID Scam\u2013unbelievable by Meryl Nass, MD Substack The vaccine does not prevent infection Just like the COVID vaccines, turns out that in the animal experiments, Jynneos did not stop monkeys getting monkeypox, but did stop them from dying. Since the current strain of monkeypox is mild, and virtually no one dies from monkeypox, this is another reason to avoid these dangerous vaccines like the plague\u2014they won\u2019t stop the infection! According to the CDC \u2018s briefing to its advisory committee on June 23, which I attended, this is generally a mild disease, requires no specific treatment, and the people who were hospitalized were hospitalized for pain control. (For example, perirectal lesions can induce painful sphincter spasms.) So, in terms of deaths, in 2022 there are now a total of 5 deaths that have been associated with Moneypox reported outside Africa, and 4 reported from Nigeria. I found only two for which there was discussion of cause of death: the Brazilian had lymphoma (lymph cancer), and the person from Peru died of a preexisting condition. We know nothing about what killed the other seven. CDC has been hiding its vaccine study of 1600 Congolese healthcare workers CDC began a study of the Jynneos vaccine in the DRC in 2017 and finished recruiting by September 2020, according to the required notification in ClinicalTrials.gov. The idea was to vaccinate people most susceptible to monkeypox and see how many got monkeypox, and what the side effects were. CDC has a lot of data, and the person who briefed the advisory committee on June 23, Brett Peterson, is the Principal Investigator of this Congo trial. Where is CDC\u2019s briefing on this study\u2019s results? This was the first study of vaccine efficacy in the world\u2014why is CDC being coy about the results? The same 2 scientists who hyped COVID\u2019s natural origin now hyping Monkeypox\u2019 natural origin Two of the same scientists who hyped the natural origin of COVID are now trying to explain the excessive number of mutations in the current Moneypox variant, which appears to be derived from a strain isolated in labs in 3 countries in 2018-9. Double-stranded DNA viruses don\u2019t usually mutate this fast\u2026since we have a 2018 start date, the mutations expected could be calculated. A lot of the mutations could have been induced by an enzyme used in labs. See DoorlessCarp\u2019s June 5 update for more on the science. The two people are Andrew Rambaut and Michael Worobey. Rambaut was one of the 5 authors of the Nature Medicine article that Tony Fauci caused to be written, to cover up the lab origin that Fauci himself funded. Worobey just published an article claiming\u2014despite everything\u2014that COVID came from nature. Now they are doing the same for Monkeypox. https:\/\/virological.org\/t\/initial-observations-about-putative-apobec3-deaminase-editing-driving-short-term-evolution-of-mpxv-since-2017\/830 https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/06\/02\/health\/monkeypox-endemic-silent-spread\/index.html US Government has created a fake shortage of vaccine Well yes, of course, they always do that to fan the flames of demand. But this is a lot bigger than that. The USG already owns 16 million doses, stored frozen in Denmark, and had spent well over $1 Billion on Jynneos vaccines before Moneypox was identified in the west. Despite the Denmark factory\u2019s \u201cfill and finish\u201d facility being completed in 2021, and despite the USG allotting $44 million for \u201cqualification\u201d of that same facility in January 2019, the FDA only got around to finishing its inspection on July 27, 2022. Supposedly this prevented the US from getting its hands on any of its supply stored overseas. Duh? And the USG ordered 1.4 million doses as recently as 2020, yet to be delivered. Meantime, President Biden asked for another $7 Billion for the $Moneypox emergency. No wonder they plan to change the name of Moneypox, which is said to be stigmatizing to Africans. They mislead. It is stigmatizing to politicians. Because of the vaccine shortage, existing vaccine will get a liability waiver How sweet is that? Jynneos is licensed, and is being used for its labelled indication (prevention of Moneypox) so the manufacturer is liable for injuries. The USG might also be liable, if it steered you wrong about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine\u2026or if it hid a study it had conducted, for example. But since we have a shortage, the USG in its benevolence and wisdom is going to dilute it and give recipients instead a 20% dose, administered intradermally instead of subcutaneously. But in order to make this kosher (kosher for whom?) the DHHS and FDA are issuing the vaccine an emergency use authorization, and we all know what that means. You can\u2019t sue anybody even if the vaccine kills you. You can apply to DHHS for small benefits from its Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, but you might be waiting a long time for an answer. The program has denied about 95% of petitioners, and no one has received a payout for a COVID vaccine injury yet. This also means that a USG contractor will now be inserted between the Danish manufacturer and the recipient. I wonder what diluent the USG will instruct them to add, or supply itself, for that matter? Read the full article here. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain. That work has been underway and the next step is for the FDA and CDC to review data from the companies, once they\u2019ve received it. The rollout was expected sometime in September, but Jha\u2019s estimate on Tuesday was the most specific to date. \u201cWe\u2019re going to know more about this in the upcoming weeks and these vaccines will become available by early to mid-September,\u201d Jha said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, again including the caveat that FDA and CDC need to act before anything can be official. \u201cBut the big picture, bottom line, is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd those vaccines are coming very, very soon.\u201d So far the U.S. has contracted for 105 million doses of the newly-updated boosters from Pfizer and 66 million doses from Moderna, the two leading COVID vaccine manufacturers for the country. Both contracts with Pfizer and Moderna include an option for hundreds of millions of more doses down the line, should the U.S. secure the money. Between Pfizer and Moderna, if both companies were able to complete their orders, the U.S. would have about 171 million doses of the new shots. But more than 260 million Americans have had at least one vaccine dose already and would theoretically consider getting a booster. (Source.) The problem is that those who want COVID-19 vaccines are a dwindling market, partly because millions of people in the U.S. have now been crippled or have died after taking the vaccines for the past 20 months, according to the CDC and FDA\u2019s own statistics in the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS). There are more deaths and injuries following emergency-use authorized experimental COVID-19 vaccines in 20 months than have been recorded in VAERS for the previous 30 years following all FDA-approved vaccines. That\u2019s not a very good repeat business model, when so many of your patients are dying and becoming crippled. And it is estimated that only 1% of all vaccine injuries and deaths are reported to VAERS, which would put the number of Americans injured by a COVID-19 vaccine at around 138 million, with around 3 million deaths. The ABC report acknowledged that this is a dwindling market: \u2026 demand for boosters has dropped with each campaign for people to get another shot. About 108 million people have received their first booster shot, for example. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCOVID Data Tracker,\u201d 261,981,618 people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 107,872,738 people have received a first booster, and only 35,200,364 have received a second booster. This is a diminishing market, and I am quite sure that the majority of the 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses will probably never be used. Millions of doses of previous COVID vaccines have already been discarded due to lack of demand and exceeding their expiration dates, but that has not stopped Pfizer and Moderna from recording record profits, even when their vaccines don\u2019t sell and are thrown away. While new polls show flatlining concern about the pandemic among Americans, Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine business continues quietly churning in the background. But amid a recent decline in vaccine demand, the company has written off a sizable chunk of inventory. In its second-quarter results announcement, Moderna said it wrote off $499 million in inventories \u201crelated to COVID-19 products that have exceeded or are expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\u201d In addition, the company took a $184 million charge because of changes in prior purchase commitments, and it recorded an expense of $131 million for \u201cunutilized external manufacturing capacity.\u201d (Source.) Reducing the Population of the Earth is the Goal So why would Big Pharma continue with a product that is killing and injuring so many people, and significantly reducing their market among the pro-vaxxers? The answer, which should be obvious to all by now, at least for those who have refused the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d and can still think for themselves, is that this is part of a global plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d from climate change. Along with reducing the world\u2019s population is a plan that is currently in place, and can especially be seen in Holland right now, to dramatically reduce the world food production as well. Bill Gates is the Billionaire Globalist who has been pushing this agenda for decades now, and a report published in ZeroHedge News today also identifies Bill Gates as the primary influence behind the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d that was just recently put into law. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 which according to the Congressional Budget Office will raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $20 billion \u2013 not to mention unleash an army of IRS agents on working class Americans over the next decade, was made possible by Bill Gates and (in smaller part) Larry Summers, who have been known to hang out together.

Gates was banking on more than just his trademark optimism about addressing climate change and other seemingly intractable problems that have been his focus since stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive two decades ago. As he revealed to Bloomberg Green, he has quietly lobbied Manchin and other senators, starting before President Joe Biden had won the White House, in anticipation of a rare moment in which heavy federal spending might be secured for the clean-energy transition. Those discussions gave him reason to believe the senator from West Virginia would come through for the climate \u2014 and he was willing to continue pressing the case himself until the very end. \u201cThe last month people felt like, OK, we tried, we\u2019re done, it failed,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI believed it was a unique opportunity.\u201d So he tapped into a relationship with Manchin that he\u2019d cultivated for at least three years. \u201cWe were able to talk even at a time when he felt people weren\u2019t listening.\u201d -Bloomberg We know, gag us with a spoon. Apparently Gates and Manchin\u2019s bromance began when the billionaire wooed the West Virgina Senator at a 2019 meal in Seattle, in an effort to garner support for clean-energy policy. Manchin at the time was the senior-most Democrat on the energy committee. \u201cMy dialogue with Joe has been going on for quite a while,\u201d said Gates. After Manchin walked (again) on the bill last December over concerns that it would exacerbate the national debt, inflation, the pandemic, and amid geopolitical uncertainty with Russia, Gates jumped into action. A few weeks later, he met with Manchin and his wife, Gayle Conelly Manchin, at a DC restaurant, where they talked about what West Virginia needed. Manchin understandably wanted to preserve jobs at the center of the US coal industry, while Gates suggested that coal plant workers could simply swap over to nuclear plants \u2013 such as those from Gates\u2019 TerraPower. Manchin apparently wasn\u2019t convinced, announcing on Feb. 1 that \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d (the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s previous iteration) was \u201cdead.\u201d In an effort to convince him otherwise, Democrats pulled together a cadre of economists and other Manchin influencers \u2013 including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who convinced Manchin that the bill wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class, or add to the deficit. Collin O\u2019Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation, recruited economists to assuage Manchin\u2019s concerns \u2014 including representatives from the University of Chicago and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

The economists were able to \u201csend this signal that [the bill\u2019s] going to help with the deficit,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slightly deflationary and it\u2019s going to spur growth and investment in all these areas.\u201d Through this subtle alchemy, clean-energy investments could be reframed for Manchin as a hedge against future spikes in oil and gas prices and a way to potentially export more energy to Europe. -Bloomberg Gates also sprang into action again on July 7, when Manchin was spotted at the Sun Valley media conference in Idaho \u2013 which Gates also attended. \u201cWe had a talk about what was missing, what needed to be done,\u201d Gates said. \u201cAnd then after that it was a lot of phone calls.\u201d Gates looks back at the new law with satisfaction.

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The pharma-funded corporate media announced yesterday that the White House has ordered 171 million \u201cnew\u201d doses of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots that should be available for the COVID-19 pro-vaccine members of the American public who are still alive after receiving previous COVID-19 shots. ABC News reported: Newly updated COVID-19 boosters tailored to target a dominant strain of the virus will be available in the next three weeks or so, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work through their processes for authorization as expected, White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha\u2019s predicted on Tuesday. In late June, the FDA directed Moderna and Pfizer to make vaccines for the upcoming winter that targeted the more contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant, along with the original COVID strain.

        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) If you suffer from eczema, you know how frustrating it can be. Itchy, irritated skin is distracting and uncomfortable. Not only that but having eczema often means having super sensitive skin. Many things can cause eczema flare-ups. But could the food you eat be one of them? This is exactly what one recent study suggests. Can the food you eat worsen eczema symptoms? Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition that causes the skin to be itchy, red, flaky, or blistered. It can occur in both adults and children. However, atopic dermatitis is more common in those with allergies, allergic rhinitis, asthma, or a family history of allergies. Eczema flare-ups can be triggered by stress, heat, fragrances, pollen, and environmental chemicals. In addition, research has shown that common foods can also contribute to symptoms. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD) found that many people experienced a reduction in eczema systems when they eliminated some foods from their diet. The researchers analyzed data from 600 study participants and found that 50% improved their symptoms by cutting out certain foods. The study results suggest that some people may find an elimination diet helpful for eczema. Eliminating these common foods may help reduce eczema symptoms If you have eczema, you may wonder if an eczema elimination diet could help. So what food triggers eczema? Researchers found that eggs, dairy, wheat, and nuts were the most common culprits of inflammation. Unfortunately, these foods are widespread. It can be hard to completely cut out these foods when they\u2019re on so many ingredient labels. However, with so many dairy and wheat alternatives available, it is possible. When eliminating common foods from your diet, you should also ensure you\u2019re not missing out on crucial nutrients. Eating primarily a whole foods (organic) diet can improve your overall health and give you more control over what goes into your body. Here is how to soothe eczema Pharmaceuticals, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, have long been a standard treatment for atopic dermatitis. But you don\u2019t have to rely on drugs alone to manage eczema symptoms. Removing one or more inflammatory foods from your diet may make a difference, as shown by the recent study. Additionally, you might find relief from other supplements, vitamins, minerals, and non-pharmacological treatments. For example, fish oil appears to hold powerful anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, vitamin D3, Zinc, oatmeal compresses, and even honey have been shown to decrease eczema symptoms. Keeping the skin hydrated is essential for eczema sufferers. Moisturizers may even be enough to treat mild eczema flare-ups. Make sure to moisturize after bathing and avoid skincare products laden with chemicals. Common fragrances, preservatives, and allergens can all just make eczema worse. Whether or not food elimination works for your eczema symptoms, you can\u2019t go wrong by eating whole, organic foods and drinking plenty of water. With love and care, eczema relief is possible.

It\u2019s worth mentioning that, regarding the alleged third most common cause of death (COVID-19), it has been shown that many cases are being counted as \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d simply if a person tests positive for COVID-19 at the time of their demise, and there hasn\u2019t been a consistent distinction between dying \u201cfrom\u201d COVID-19 vs. dying \u201cwith\u201d COVID-19. In any case, some experts warn that the COVID shot itself will soon be one of the world\u2019s leading killers. So were these mRNA jabs indeed just a massive bioweapon assault on the planet? Dr. David Martin: 700 million people will die because of COVID vax within the next six years Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog recently posted an interview with Dr. David Martin, who, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is the founder, CEO, and Chairman of M-CAM International, an \u201cintangible asset underwriter and analyst firm spanning work in innovation finance, trade, and intangible asset finance.\u201d Running a company that is \u201ccommitted to the ethical, transparent, and accountable alignment of capital and resources with innovation and creativity,\u201d Dr. Martin has also been heavily involved in the growing collection of lawsuits brought forth against private medical companies and the U.S. federal government surrounding the questionable mass COVID vax agenda. In the interview, Dr. Martin makes several jaw-dropping claims surrounding the COVID mRNA jabs, which he refers to as \u201cbioweapons and bioterrorism.\u201d For example, Dr. Martin says: The shot is \u201cnot a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d but instead simply a \u201cspike protein instruction to make the human body produce a toxin\u201d The COVID shot agenda was \u201cnot a public health measure,\u201d but rather a \u201cpremeditated \u2026 campaign of domestic terror to get the public to accept the universal vaccine platform using a known biological weapon\u201d Warning that the COVID shot fallout is \u201cgoing to get much worse,\u201d Dr. Martin says that by Pharma\u2019s and the government\u2019s \u201cown estimate,\u201d about 700 million people globally will die from the COVID jabs by 2028, including 75 to 100 million Americans. \u201cThere are a lot of reasons why they hope it will be between now and 2028,\u201d he continues, \u201cbecause there is this tiny little glitch of the illiquidity of the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs.

        "title":"WARNING: Why COVID-19 vaccine could become a HUGE failure, according to environmental health scientists",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/covid-19-vaccine-announcement-3636.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) Will a COVID-19 vaccine return us to a sense of \u201cnormalcy,\u201d quelling the global pandemic and putting an end to one of the worst years in human history? Or, is it destined to be just another rabbit hole in which roll-out and distribution are a logistical nightmare, negative side effects more common than initially predicted, and where pharma giants make huge profits from free-riding on research carried out by the public sector? Even worse, thought of by many people, this \u201csolution\u201d could very well be part of a depopulation agenda by the global elite. Whatever you think, there is one simple problem being overlooked \u2013 that we\u2019ll point out today\u2026 According to researchers and environmental health scientists, a successful COVID-19 vaccine could be hindered by the widespread contamination of PFAS chemicals found in everyday products. These man-made chemicals, or forever chemicals, have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s and exist in everything from non-stick pans and waterproof clothes to pizza boxes and fast-food wrappers. \u201cForever chemicals\u201d are inside 99% percent of Americans and can influence the results of a COVID-19 vaccine Once hailed as a miracle of modern chemistry, PFAS are now a public scourge and national health crisis, having been linked to liver damage, decreased fertility, and cancer. Scientists are now warning that PFAS might reduce the effectiveness of certain administered vaccines. Currently, it\u2019s uncertain if PFAS contamination will disrupt the messenger RNA genetic material in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. However, research has shown that children exposed to PFAS had significantly reduced antibody concentrations after given tetanus and diphtheria vaccinations. (Why does this matter? Keep reading\u2026) How confident should we be in a vaccine? Take this news with a grain of salt In a recent press conference, the German company BioNTech and the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said that their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine outperformed expectations in phase 3, proving 90% effective. BioNTech\u2019s CEO even went so far as to say that the vaccine will \u201cbash the virus over the head.\u201d On the surface \u2026 this may appear to be positive news. As COVID-19 numbers spike, grim milestones are met (over 250,000 dead in the U.S.) and new lockdowns and restrictions enforced around the world, many people are desperate to see \u2013 and believe in \u2013 \u201cthe light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d But the idea that forever chemicals might hinder the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine casts a (huge) long shadow, and one can\u2019t help but wonder if two \u201cmiracles of modern chemistry\u201d will result in a terrible outcome. In critic and essayist Elisa Gabbert\u2019s book on disaster, The Unreality of Memory and other essays, she writes: \u201cMy research into past disasters \u2013 the plagues and the almost nuclear wars \u2013 was often oddly comforting. We\u2019re still here, after all. But I can only take so much comfort in the past. This point in history does feel different, like we\u2019re nearing an event horizon.\u201d What if that event horizon isn\u2019t COVID-19 but the inability to develop a fully effective pharmaceutical \u201csolution\u201d because of the PFAS chemicals we\u2019ve polluted our bodies with? This is exactly the reason why we \u2013 at NaturalHealth365 \u2013 promote (so strongly) the importance of supporting a strong immune system. The point is simple: a strong immune system is your best defense against bacterial and viral infections.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/gavi-primes-us-for-the-next-pandemic.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) Is the global elites\u2019 agenda hidden in plain sight? An organization (GAVI) funded largely by Bill Gates recently posted a list of viruses that could be at the heart of future pandemics \u2013 a foreboding message that Gates and others like him continue to allude to. Are the world\u2019s most influential people simply trying to prepare nations and their infrastructures for looming global health threats \u2013 or is this just a massive predictive programming ploy aimed to justify the ongoing production of even more vaxxes, vax mandates, and other globalist measures to increase control over individual lives? Global elites are normalizing the \u201cnext pandemic,\u201d continuing to position vaxxes as the be-all, end-all for public health The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), also called the Vaccine Alliance, is an international organization that aims to \u201csave lives and protect people\u2019s health by increasing equitable and sustainable use of vaccines.\u201d Relying on both public and private sectors for funding, GAVI lists World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the World Bank, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation among its \u201ccore partners.\u201d Currently, on their website, GAVI shares a bold, fear-mongering statement: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t the first to devastate the world, and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d It almost sounds like a voice-over for a thriller film, doesn\u2019t it? Adding that they have rounded up \u201cemerging infectious threats that have the potential to erupt into global pandemics,\u201d GAVI lists 11 viruses that could drive the next pandemic. These 11 viruses and viral diseases include: Rift Valley fever (has been classified as a category A bioterrorism agent because of its potential to devastate large-scale agricultural economies and cause social disruption.) Hantavirus Other evolved or mutated strains of coronavirus Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Lassa fever Marburg (called a \u201ccousin\u201d of Ebola, this virus reportedly can kill up to nine out of ten people it infects) Yellow fever H5N1 and H7N9 influenza Chikungunya Ebola Nipah virus (another virus considered so deadly that it is classified by many global governments as a bioterrorism threat) GAVI states that these viruses have been particularly recognized as potential threats because of factors such as long incubation periods, increasing globalization and international travel, climate change, and massive death of livestock and subsequent \u201cagricultural collapse\u201d (to say nothing of how these viruses may end up affecting human health directly). In addition to developing more vaxxes (and implementing plenty of non-invasive measures, too, such as mosquito netting), GAVI insists that \u201cearly warning systems\u201d are going to be \u201cvital\u201d for preventing outbreaks of any of these viruses from turning into full-blown epidemics or pandemics. GAVI, Gates, and White House want future vaccines to be made in a little over three months \u2013 is this sufficient scientific rigor for mass-marketed drugs that governments want to give to virtually every man, woman, and child? In case you\u2019re curious, there is also an article on GAVI\u2019s website, dated June 8, 2022, that has this questionable title: \u201cSpeeding up vaccine development: Can we go from lab to jab in just 100 days?\u201d Such lightning-speed science is apparently \u201ctotally feasible\u201d according to the U.S. White House Science Advisor Eric Lander, the article states, adding that \u201csafety and efficacy weren\u2019t compromised for COVID-19 vaccine development, as several vaccine trials had independent data monitoring committees to review the data in real-time, rather than the usual lengthy post-development review process.\u201d The article continues: \u201cFor the next pandemic, innovations in review and regulatory approval are likely to allow the whole process to be further sped up\u201d (emphasis ours). GAVI says that \u201cinsights from large COVID-19 clinical trials\u201d will be essential for accelerating future vax development. But is relying on such \u201cinsights\u201d even prudent when we know that there are serious ethical inconsistencies with how Pfizer and other Pharma players conducted their COVID trials in the first place? Are global leaders seriously preparing to rely on questionable clinical trial data to make massive changes in the \u201creview and regulatory approval\u201d for new jabs? What kind of precedent is this setting for pharmaceutical companies? Sources for this article include: GAVI.org GAVI.org Thegatewaypundit.com",

        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) If you suffer from eczema, you know how frustrating it can be. Itchy, irritated skin is distracting and uncomfortable. Not only that but having eczema often means having super sensitive skin. Many things can cause eczema flare-ups. But could the food you eat be one of them? This is exactly what one recent study suggests. Can the food you eat worsen eczema symptoms? Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition that causes the skin to be itchy, red, flaky, or blistered. It can occur in both adults and children. However, atopic dermatitis is more common in those with allergies, allergic rhinitis, asthma, or a family history of allergies. Eczema flare-ups can be triggered by stress, heat, fragrances, pollen, and environmental chemicals. In addition, research has shown that common foods can also contribute to symptoms. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD) found that many people experienced a reduction in eczema systems when they eliminated some foods from their diet. The researchers analyzed data from 600 study participants and found that 50% improved their symptoms by cutting out certain foods. The study results suggest that some people may find an elimination diet helpful for eczema. Eliminating these common foods may help reduce eczema symptoms If you have eczema, you may wonder if an eczema elimination diet could help. So what food triggers eczema? Researchers found that eggs, dairy, wheat, and nuts were the most common culprits of inflammation. Unfortunately, these foods are widespread. It can be hard to completely cut out these foods when they\u2019re on so many ingredient labels. However, with so many dairy and wheat alternatives available, it is possible. When eliminating common foods from your diet, you should also ensure you\u2019re not missing out on crucial nutrients. Eating primarily a whole foods (organic) diet can improve your overall health and give you more control over what goes into your body. Here is how to soothe eczema Pharmaceuticals, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, have long been a standard treatment for atopic dermatitis. But you don\u2019t have to rely on drugs alone to manage eczema symptoms. Removing one or more inflammatory foods from your diet may make a difference, as shown by the recent study. Additionally, you might find relief from other supplements, vitamins, minerals, and non-pharmacological treatments. For example, fish oil appears to hold powerful anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, vitamin D3, Zinc, oatmeal compresses, and even honey have been shown to decrease eczema symptoms. Keeping the skin hydrated is essential for eczema sufferers. Moisturizers may even be enough to treat mild eczema flare-ups. Make sure to moisturize after bathing and avoid skincare products laden with chemicals. Common fragrances, preservatives, and allergens can all just make eczema worse. Whether or not food elimination works for your eczema symptoms, you can\u2019t go wrong by eating whole, organic foods and drinking plenty of water. With love and care, eczema relief is possible.

        "title":"Coronavirus UPDATE: Massive coverup exposed by bioweapons expert",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/coronavirus-death-toll-3285.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) As we continue to report on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic, we\u2019re beginning to realize there\u2019s so much more to 2019-nCoV than mainstream media would have you believe. We only need to start with the virus\u2019s origin story to start pulling back the layers of deception and misinformation. As we\u2019ve stated in an earlier article, the prevalent theory has been that the coronavirus began in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Now, blistering new revelations from an American bioweapons expert shatter this theory and point to a much more sinister beginning for the virus, which has amassed a current death toll of over 800 people. Deadly virus created in a Wuhan laboratory, says U.S. international law professor \u2013 a laboratory specially designated by the World Health Organization Dr. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He holds multiple prestigious degrees, including a doctor of law degree from Harvard Law School and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He\u2019s best known for drafting The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. In a recent interview published on January 30 to YouTube, Dr. Boyle gave a detailed account of how 2019-nCoV didn\u2019t originate in the wet market of the Hubei province. Was the virus ever actually present in the market, and could its presence have accelerated the rapid viral outbreak? Absolutely, Dr. Boyle and others argue. But that doesn\u2019t mean the virus actually began there. So, where did this dangerous strain of coronavirus begin? Dr Boyle contends that the virus was manufactured and bio-engineered in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory \u2013 a laboratory that just so happens to be located directly in Wuhan. This laboratory is specially designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the only lab in China that can contain and work with the world\u2019s deadliest viruses. Dr. Boyle asserts this is proof that the WHO knows far more about the outbreak than they are letting on. The allegation is consistent with a January 2020 paper published by The Lancet, which found that more than a third of the patients tested in their sample had NO contact with the Wuhan wet market, including \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d In other words, growing evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory and into the surrounding community, where it would go on to infect thousands of unsuspecting people \u2013 a number that\u2019s steadily rising. Now scrambling to contain the epidemic, the Chinese government initially tried to cover it up. They even threatened and attempted to silence a Chinese doctor named Li Wenliang who first warned of the coming outbreak. Sadly, breaking reports tell us that Wenliang succumbed to the virus on February 7. New coronavirus has links to manufactured SARS virus, HIV virus Why manufacture and design a lethal and unprecedented virus? Simple, Dr. Boyle asserts: to create biological weapons for warfare. In the interview (which hopefully won\u2019t be removed from YouTube), he hypothesizes that WHO-affiliated Wuhan scientists genetically tinkered with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV) until it became the monstrosity it is now (2019-nCoV). The current coronavirus reportedly has a 15 percent greater fatality rate and 83 percent greater infection rate than SARS did, which ransacked the world in 2002 to 2004. Dr. Boyle also cites evidence indicating that Chinese officials smuggled coronavirus materials out of a Canadian lab that\u2019s known for leading research, development, and testing of biological warfare weapons. Additionally, a team of Indian virologists just revealed in a January 2020 paper that the 2019-nCoV shares an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d of genetic inserts with the virus that causes AIDS. (Their paper has been withdrawn\u2026another thinly-veiled cover up attempt?) Tellingly, Chinese doctors have reportedly been using the HIV drug lopinavir\/ritonavir as an off-label treatment for people with 2019-nCoV\u2026so clearly there\u2019s no denying at least some link between these two viruses. Meanwhile, other scientists seem to be wasting no time to continue tinkering with viruses and trying to capitalize on the outbreak. In an article published by CNN on February 7, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, states rather bluntly: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that as a global community we maximize our effort to get a vaccine available in the shortest possible time.\u201d Big Pharma experts are hopeful that a vaccine will be available as soon as 2021 \u2013 \u201cfaster than it\u2019s been done before,\u201d brags Shattock. Stay tuned for regular updates about the coronavirus and more tips on keeping your family healthy.

        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) Heart disease, cancer, COVID-19, accidents, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, and kidney disease \u2026 these are the current top 10 causes of death in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It\u2019s worth mentioning that, regarding the alleged third most common cause of death (COVID-19), it has been shown that many cases are being counted as \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d simply if a person tests positive for COVID-19 at the time of their demise, and there hasn\u2019t been a consistent distinction between dying \u201cfrom\u201d COVID-19 vs. dying \u201cwith\u201d COVID-19. In any case, some experts warn that the COVID shot itself will soon be one of the world\u2019s leading killers. So were these mRNA jabs indeed just a massive bioweapon assault on the planet? Dr. David Martin: 700 million people will die because of COVID vax within the next six years Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog recently posted an interview with Dr. David Martin, who, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is the founder, CEO, and Chairman of M-CAM International, an \u201cintangible asset underwriter and analyst firm spanning work in innovation finance, trade, and intangible asset finance.\u201d Running a company that is \u201ccommitted to the ethical, transparent, and accountable alignment of capital and resources with innovation and creativity,\u201d Dr. Martin has also been heavily involved in the growing collection of lawsuits brought forth against private medical companies and the U.S. federal government surrounding the questionable mass COVID vax agenda. In the interview, Dr. Martin makes several jaw-dropping claims surrounding the COVID mRNA jabs, which he refers to as \u201cbioweapons and bioterrorism.\u201d For example, Dr. Martin says: The shot is \u201cnot a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d but instead simply a \u201cspike protein instruction to make the human body produce a toxin\u201d The COVID shot agenda was \u201cnot a public health measure,\u201d but rather a \u201cpremeditated \u2026 campaign of domestic terror to get the public to accept the universal vaccine platform using a known biological weapon\u201d Warning that the COVID shot fallout is \u201cgoing to get much worse,\u201d Dr. Martin says that by Pharma\u2019s and the government\u2019s \u201cown estimate,\u201d about 700 million people globally will die from the COVID jabs by 2028, including 75 to 100 million Americans. \u201cThere are a lot of reasons why they hope it will be between now and 2028,\u201d he continues, \u201cbecause there is this tiny little glitch of the illiquidity of the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs. So, the fewer recipients of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, the better. Not surprisingly, the recommendation was [that] people over the age of 65 were the first ones to get injected.\u201d Watch the video below in its entirety to hear more from Dr. Martin: What is a bioweapon? Let\u2019s look at some definitions to help us make sense of this confusing information. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), bioweapons or biological weapons \u201cform a subset of a larger class of weapons sometimes referred to as unconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction, which also includes chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons. The use of biological agents is a serious concern, and the risk of using these agents in a terrorist attack is thought to be increasing.\u201d The WHO warns of potential serious public health effects due to biological agents, \u201cwhether [they are] characterized as a deliberate act or a naturally occurring event.\u201d Weapons of mass destruction indeed. According to Bloomberg, the most recent estimate shows that more than 12.2 billion doses of COVID shots have been given around the world, including nearly 600 million doses in the U.S. alone.

        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) About a year and a half after the first mRNA COVID shots were given in the United States, we are now seeing rising reports of young people experiencing blood clots, heart inflammation, sudden collapse, and other health problems. Many experts have warned that the COVID shots themselves could be contributing to many of these issues, although more clarification and due diligence are needed to establish the possible connection. We do know that public health officials have long admitted that these COVID shots come with both known and unknown health risks. Could cancer now be considered one of those previously unknown risks? Doctor claims COVID injections are driving increasing cancer rates Dr. Ryan Cole is a board-certified pathologist and the owner of Cole Diagnostics, a medical lab in Idaho. Dr. Cole has become a loud voice in the bodily autonomy and health freedom movement, which has gained significant momentum thanks to the pandemic. He has also come out publicly against vax mandates and expressed concerns that the mRNA COVID shots could cause life-altering health problems. Among the evidence he uses to support his claims, Dr. Cole has previously cited a 2018 paper published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery which discussed a \u201cpossible concern\u201d with mRNA-based drugs, namely that \u201csome mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity.\u201d \u201cThus,\u201d the paper continues, \u201cidentification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.\u201d Dr. Cole is also quoted by FactCheck.org as saying that animal trials with mRNA therapy have led to the development of \u201codd cancers\u201d and \u201cautoimmune diseases\u201d among mammalian study subjects, up to a year following injections. In his direct clinical experience, Dr. Cole says he\u2019s seen a dramatic increase in the number of people coming into his practice with gynecological cancers, including a \u201c20 times increase\u201d in endometrial cancers compared to what he typically sees on an annual basis, according to a video made available by Health Freedom Idaho in August 2021. It is his belief, based on his interpretation of the evidence that these rising cases of cancer and autoimmune problems are due to immune damage caused directly by the COVID-19 shots. To listen to more of Dr. Cole\u2019s perspective, watch the video below: Should COVID shot recipients be concerned about their future health? Dr. Cole has so far met with his fair share of fact-checking and counterclaims. Mainstream sources, including Reuters, insist that there is no evidence supporting Dr. Cole\u2019s assertions about the COVID shot\/cancer link. However, and lest we forget: absence of evidence does not necessarily mean evidence of absence \u2026 and don\u2019t you think the burden of proof should be on the people who are coercing individuals to take these products? Despite the overall confusion surrounding this contentious topic, one thing is clear: These COVID shots do not stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases (e.g., vax failures) are no longer rare, as the media first claimed. With this in mind, people should remain free to choose (without coercion) whether the unknown risks of these shots are worth the questionable benefits.

        "title":"Large German Insurer Reports Staggering Rise in Adverse Effects from COVID-19 Vaccines",
        "link":"https:\/\/dailysceptic.org\/2022\/08\/13\/large-german-insurer-reports-staggering-rise-in-adverse-effects-from-covid-19-vaccines\/",
        "text":"According to a response to an official request for information from the German Techniker Krankenkasse insurer, the number of billed cases of vaccine-related adverse effects needing medical treatment skyrocketed in 2021 compared with 2019 and 2020. The request relates to four diagnostic codes: T.88.0: Infection following immunisation T.88.1: Other complications after immunisation U.12.9: Adverse effects after Covid-19 immunisation Y.59.9: Complications due to vaccines or biological substances In 2019, the total number of confirmed diagnoses was 13,777. In 2020 it was 15,044. In 2021 the total number was 437,593. This is more than thirty-fold the average for those four codes in 2019-2020, a 2,937% increase. Number of payouts by the Techniker Krankenkasse related to codes T.88.0, T.88.1, U.12.9 and Y.59.9 by quarter More precisely, it is the T.88.1 \u2013 Other complications after immunization, and U.12.9 \u2013 Adverse effects after Covid-19 immunization \u2013 that are spiking. The latter code of course has no data for the prior years, but close to 150 thousand incidences in 2021. Approximately 11 million people are insured by the Techniker Krankenkasse. 473,593 cases of medical treatment resulting from vaccination thus amounts to around one in every 23 people vaccinated, assuming all 11 million are vaccinated. The rate for 2019 and 2020 is one in every 760 people. The vaccination effort against COVID-19 is unprecedented in its scale and thus a rise in the number of adverse effects is to be expected. But what should be expected? We can try to correct for the difference in scale to compare the COVID-19 vaccination effort with vaccination for other diseases. As the German total numbers are not easy to come by, we approximate this by using worldwide estimates. In 2017, the WHO estimates 2.7 billion vaccine doses were administered worldwide. In 2021, 57.7% of the world\u2019s population had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which amounts to about 4.55 billion people. From this we can conclude the number of persons vaccinated against COVID-19 last year was about 1.7 times the number otherwise vaccinated against other diseases. Thus, assuming the number of people vaccinated against other diseases stayed the same, the number vaccinated in total against any disease in 2021 was 2.7 times the earlier number. Correcting for this difference we get an eleven-fold increase in adverse effects needing medical treatment. This is a rough estimate, but gives us some idea of the actual rate. Last February, a board member of another German insurance company, BKK Provita, Andreas Sch\u00f6fbeck, informed the Paul Ehrlich Institute of a tenfold rise in the incidence rate of adverse effects among the company\u2018s clients, due to the COVID-19 vaccines. Sch\u00f6fbeck was promptly fired from the company after his disclosure. The US VAERS database shows a 35-fold increase in reported vaccine-related deaths in 2021 compared with 2019. In 2021, Iceland saw a 160-fold increase in reports of all adverse effects from vaccination compared with 2019. In July of this year, the Icelandic National Health Insurance had received 40 applications for damages resulting from COVID-19 vaccination, approximately one for every 8,000 people vaccinated. Recent studies of excess mortality and adverse effects indicate the mRNA vaccines especially provide limited if any benefit. Dr. Martin Kulldorff, former professor at Harvard Medical School, member of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and a former member of the Vaccine Safety Subgroup of the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices, concluded in an article last July that the benefits for working age people were unclear and that the elderly only \u201cmay benefit\u201c from being vaccinated. The new German numbers only add to already rising concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. Especially with the now prevalent and much milder Omicron variant, the data indicate that vaccination may increase infection and hospitalisation rates rather than reducing them and produces a rise in all-cause mortality. In light of this, continuing to inject younger people is highly irresponsible, if not criminal. And now, a few weeks after Danish health authorities banned the vaccination of children below the age of 18, new Thai research indicates as many as one in three teenagers suffer from heart-related problems following mRNA vaccination.",
