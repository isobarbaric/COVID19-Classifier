        "Best Mask to Prevent COVID-19 and How Do Cloth, Disposable, N95, and KN95 Masks Compare",
        "Answer:\n\nN95 masks are the gold standard, but other good options exist if you do not have an N95, primarily KN95 masks and well-made, well-fitting, 3-layer cloth masks. Disposable surgical masks are also readily available but tend to leave gaps between the mask and face, reducing their usefulness (although there are ways to improve it).\n\n\n\nIf you want to find and buy a good mask that meets the guidelines of the U.S. CDC as well as the World Health Organization, go right to Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy.\n\n\n\nIf you want an N95 respirator, see Finding the Best N95 Masks section. If you want a KN95 respirator, see the Finding the Best KN95 Masks section.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your own mask (which can be quite effective) see the Best combination of materials for making a mask section. We also identify what seem to be the best disposable filter materials.\n\n\n\nMasks can be used alone or, for increased protection, particularly for the eyes, with a face shield \u2014 which we have also reviewed.\n\n\n\nHere's what we cover in this answer:\n\nWhy and when you should wear a mask\n\nWhile vaccination to protect against COVID-19 has led to a decreased need for masking in certain situations, unvaccinated individuals are still advised to wear a mask when in public indoor settings. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, masks are recommended for fully vaccinated individuals when in indoor spaces with high community transmission rates, as well as for fully vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems or who are taking immune-suppressing drugs. Masks are also required for all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, when required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws (including local business and workplace guidance), on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. (Get more details about masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in our article about COVID vaccines).\n\n\n\nAlong with social distancing, a mask provides additional protection from infecting others as well as preventing exposure. In addition, according to the CDC, \"cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns.\" A review of studies found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses was 82% lower with physical distancing of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or more, compared with shorter distances, and protection might increase with additional distance. Face mask use could result in an 85% reduction in risk of infection versus no face mask, with stronger associations for N-95 or similar respirators, while surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks were less effective but offered more protection than single-layer masks (Chu, Lancet 2020).\n\n\n\nAs wearing a mask may reduce the amount of virus to which a wearer is exposed, it has been postulated that even if a mask-wearing person becomes infected, the reduced viral load to which they were exposed may mean that they suffer a milder disease. For example, on cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of infected patients (81%) were asymptomatic on a ship that had provided masks to all passengers and staff compared to only 18% of cases being asymptomatic on a cruise ship without masking (Gandhi, J Gen Intern Med 2020; Gandhi, N Engl J Med 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother benefit of wearing a mask is that, due to the heat and moisture of exhaled breath, masks have been shown to increase the humidity and temperature of inhaled air, which, researchers have proposed, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as COVID by promoting the clearance of pathogens in the lungs (Courtney, Biophysical J 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nAlthough previously reserved for healthcare workers to due a shortages in supply, the CDC advised on January 14, 2022 that N95 and KN95 respirators may be worn by the general public, with the exception of surgical N95 respirators, which are standardized for fluid resistance, i.e. blood splatter, and continue to be reserved for use in healthcare settings. In its updated guidance regarding masks and respirators the agency stated, \"While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, properly fitted respirators provide the highest level of protection.\" (See our reviews of N95 and KN95 respirators below.) It also emphasized that use of well-fitted masks and respirators are particularly important in high-risk situations and for people who may be at risk for more severe disease.\n\n\n\n[Note: On January 19, 2022, the U.S. government announced that it will make approximately 400 million N95 respirators available free of charge to the public, possibly as early as the week of January 24th. According to a New York Times article about the announcement, the N95s will be distributed through community centers and retail pharmacies and will be limited to three per person. Details about brands or models were not provided.]\n\n\n\nIf using a cloth or disposable mask, be sure it fully covers the nose and mouth. Clear panel masks are acceptable to facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or who otherwise need to see a speaker's mouth in order to communicate. In addition to fully covering the nose and mouth, masks should also fulfill the following guidelines:\n\nCloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source). (See our Top Picks among cloth masks that meet these requirements. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers.\n\n) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. Masks should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face.\n\nMasks should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.\n\nScarves, ski masks, turtlenecks pulled over the face, masks made from loosely woven material, and masks with slits, exhalation valves, or punctures are not acceptable.\n\n\n\nFace shields and goggles can be worn with masks, but cannot be worn instead of a mask. (See our Top Pick among face shields).\n\n\n\nFailure to wear a mask as described above is a violation of federal law and can be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and state and local authorities. The TSA has proposed a fine of $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders (TSA 2021). However, there are several exceptions to the requirement: Masks may be removed for brief periods of time when eating, drinking, or taking medication, while communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when required to verify one's identity, and when requested by a ticket agent or law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\nAny benefit to wearing masks at home?\n\n\n\nAlthough CDC guidelines do not currently include the use of face masks at home, the rate of transmission from one household family member to another was 79% lower when members wore face masks prior to the first member developing COVID-19 symptoms, according to a study of 124 families in Beijing in which there was at least one infected person. Overall, there was a 23% rate of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected family member to another, but this was no lower when mask wearing began after the first member developed symptoms. These results are consistent with the fact that viral load is highest two days before symptoms and on the first day of symptoms. Daily use of disinfectants reduced transmission by 77%. Transmission rates were four times higher if the primary case had diarrhea and 18 times higher when there was frequent daily close contact (less than 3 feet apart). The researchers recommended use of face masks in families in which a member has been at risk of getting infected. In China, over 70% of transmission occurred within families (Wang, BMJ Global Health 2020).\n\n\n\nBest combination of materials for making a mask\n\nCurrently, both the CDC and WHO provide basic guidelines for choosing a cloth mask.\n\nAccording to CDC guidelines, a cloth mask should:\n\nUse a minimum of 2 - 3 layers, preferably with batting between the layers\n\nUse fabrics with high thread count and fine weave, water-resistant fabric, and hybrid fabrics such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel (cotton blends may be better than pure cotton). (In addition, the CDC notes that, due to their electrostatic charge, materials such as polypropylene may enhance filtration efficacy and fabrics such as silk can help to repel droplets.)\n\nCover the nose and chin\n\nFit snugly on the sides of the face without gaps\n\nBe secured with ties or ear loops\n\nUse ties rather than ear loops because ties provide better fit\n\nIt also advises that if wearing a neck gaiter, choose one with two layers or fold it to make two layers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the CDC warns not to choose masks that are:\n\nMade of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, such as vinyl\n\nHave exhalation valves or vents, as this allows virus particles to escape\n\nReserverd for healthcare workers (i.e. surgical N95s\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) provides more details about which types of fabrics may work best. It recommends using three layers of fabric for non-medical, cloth masks in order to achieve the best combination of filtration efficacy and breathability:\n\n\n\n1. Innermost layer: Hydrophilic material (i.e., one that can absorb moisture, such as cotton or cotton blends)\n\n\n\n2. Middle layer: Hydrophobic material (i.e., repels moisture) of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a second cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets.\n\n\n\n3. Outermost layer: Hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearer's nose and mouth.\n\n\n\n(See Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy for our review of masks for sale that appear to meet the WHO requirements)\n\n\n\nNote that polypropylene, a material often used to make disposable surgical masks, has an electrostatic charge which can improve the filtration efficiency of masks. Polypropylene \"spunbound\" is sold in fabric and many other retail and online stores under brand names such as Oly*fun and Pellon. Polypropylene is sold in different weights (measured in grams per square meter or GSM). Most commercially manufactured surgical masks are made of 3-ply 25GSM. Polypropylene materials between 25 and 40 GSM tend to have similar filtration efficacy and breathability, while polypropylene 60 GSM has a higher filtration efficiency but less breathability (Zhao, Nano Lett 2020). Be aware that some forms of polypropylene should not be machine washed.\n\n\n\nSee below for a more detailed discussion of the filtration efficacy of various cotton and synthetic household fabrics.\n\n\n\nNote that Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) has advised against using face masks labeled as containing graphene (or biomass graphene) due to concerns that graphene particles might be inhaled (Health Canada April 2, 2021). Graphene is promoted for use in some masks as having antibacterial and antiviral properties. Preliminary research suggests that graphene particles may cause early lung toxicity in animals, but the agency noted that the \"potential for people to inhale graphene particles from face masks and the related health risks are not yet known, and may vary based on mask design.\" Health Canada has asked distributors in Canada to stop selling graphene masks while it investigates the safety of using graphene in masks, and advised that people who have used graphene face masks and \"have health concerns, or symptoms such as new or unexplained shortness of breath, discomfort or difficulty breathing,\" to consult with their healthcare provider. For examples of graphene masks sold in the U.S., sign in and read the full answer.\n\n\n\nStandards for masks\n\n\n\nASTM International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), has published voluntary standards for non-medical cloth face masks. Masks labeled \"Meets ASTM F3502\" must be shown, in an accredited laboratory, to meet one of two designations that will also appear on the mask label:\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 20% and airflow resistance of < 15 mm H2O\n\n\n\nLevel 2: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 50% and airflow resistance of < 5 mm HH 2 O\n\n\n\n(For comparison, a NIOSH approved N95 must have an airflow resistance of no more than 35 mm H 2 O).\n\n\n\nMasks that claim to meet ASTM standards are also required to provide user instructions for size proper selection, proper use, and cleaning or disposal instructions.\n\nHow cotton and other household fabrics compare in blocking coronavirusdish cloth (85% polyester and 15% nylon) was slightly better -- 97.9%. In addition, most household fabrics were more breathable than the material in a medical mask. The dish cloth, for example, was twice as breathable as the medical mask (Aydin, medRxiv 2020 --preprint). (See the CDC website to learn how to make a cloth face covering.)\n\n\n\nTightly woven cotton, combined with silk or chiffon\n\nA study at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory found that tightly woven, high-thread count cotton (600 thread-per-inch (TPI) sheet by Wamsutta) was more effective in filtering large droplets (similar to larger-sized SARS-CoV-2 droplets) than loosely woven cotton with a lower thread count (quilters cotton, 80 TPI), while fabrics with an electrostatic charge (such as silk and chiffon) were best for blocking aerosols -- the smaller sized droplets that remain suspended in air for extended amounts of time. Using layers of both fabrics, together, was most effective for blocking both large and small droplets. For example, two layers of 600 TPI cotton fabric had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.5% and 82%, respectively, but one layer of 600 TPI cotton combined with two layers of chiffon (90% polyester, 10% spandex from Jo-Ann Stores) had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.2% and 97% -- which, at low airflow rates (i.e., when not all air is drawn through the mask) is nearly as good as a properly-fitted N95 mask for blocking large particles and better than the N-95 with respect to small particles, of which only 85% are blocked by an N-95 mask). However, as emphasized in a published correction to the study, it is not known how efficient this fabric combination will be at normal or high rates of airflow when made into a fitted mask, i.e., when there are no leaks and all air flows directly through the mask, particularly when one is engaged in high levels of exertion. The researchers also found that small holes or leaks around the edges of the fabrics could decrease the blocking efficacy by 50% or more, and emphasized the importance of a good fit (snug and without gaps) (Konda, ACS Nano 2020). [Note: An illustration in the study shows the electrostatic layer of fabric as the inner layer when fabrics were combined. However, ConsumerLab contacted the author of the study who suggested that electrostatic fabric (such as chiffon) may be best used as the outer layer of the mask to avoid humidity from the nose or mouth, which could interfere with the electrostatic properties, but emphasized that was his suggestion, not something that was tested in the study.]\n\n\n\nCotton bandanas and handkerchiefs\n\nIn another study, researchers at Florida Atlantic University tested masks made from common household fabrics, as well a typical \"cone\" mask (often sold at pharmacies) to see how well they worked to stop droplets using a simulated model of coughing (a mannequin head through which liquid was manually pumped). Without any covering, droplets from the simulated cough traveled an average of 8 feet. With a bandana (single-layer, elastic T-shirt material, 85 threads per inch) droplets traveled an average of 3 ft. 7 inches, with a folded cotton handkerchief (as shown in this instructional video featuring the U.S. Surgeon General), 1 ft. 3 inches, and with a cone mask (CVS Cone Face Mask), 8 inches. The most effective mask was a stitched cotton mask (using two-layers of cotton quilting fabric, 70 threads per inch), with which droplets traveled just 2.5 inches. The researchers noted that \"healthcare professionals trained properly in the use of high-quality fitted masks will not experience leakage to the extent that we have observed in this study. However, leakage remains a likely issue for members of the general public who often rely on loose-fitting homemade masks.\" (Verma, Phys Fluids 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and surgical masks\n\nRather than focus on how far droplets travel, researchers at Duke looked at how well different masks block droplets during speaking. A fitted N95 mask without a valve was most effective in retaining droplets, with less than 1% of droplets being transmitted. The next most effective, in order, were a 3-layer surgical mask, a cotton-polypropylene-cotton \"apron\" mask, a 2-layer polypropylene mask, a 2-layer cotton pleated mask, and then an N95 with a valve.\n\n\n\nNeck gaiters (fleece, microfiber & polyester)\n\nThe Duke researchers found that two masks offered little protection: A double-layer bandana was only slightly more effective than using no face covering at all, while the worst face covering was a \"gaiter\" style neck fleece (often worn during running or sports) that showed a 10% increase in the number of droplets. The researchers suggested that the neck fleece material breaks larger liquid droplets into smaller droplets than can more easily be dispersed into the air (Fischer, Sci Adv 2020 \u2014 includes photos of the masks but no details about origin or brands). However, tests conducted by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute found that, when measuring droplets that dispersed in an outward direction at a distance of about 1 ft. (30 cm), neck gaiters (one made of thin, 100% polyester (Chaos) and the other, a thicker, microfiber gaiter made of 87% polyester and 13% elastane (Cirque)) worked as well as a cloth mask (a no-sew mask made of cotton T-shirt material), blocking 100% of larger droplets (> 20 microns), 90% of droplets 5 microns in size, and 50% of 0.5 micron aerosols. They were somewhat less efficient than the cloth mask at blocking smaller aerosols, although when the thinner gaiter was doubled over, it blocked about 90% of droplets and aerosols (0.5 to 5 microns) (Pan, Virginia Tech PDF 2020).\n\n\n\nWhen doubled over, some neck gaiters may be more effective than a triple layer, all-cotton cloth mask. A study conducted by researchers at the CDC and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), found that a single-layer polyester neck gaiter (FKGIONG Sun UV Protection Neck Gaiter, 95% polyester, 5% Spandex) blocked 47% of outward moving cough aerosols (ranging in size from 0 to 7 microns) and when doubled over, blocked 60%. This was slightly better than a medical procedure mask with ear loops, which blocked 59% and a cloth mask made of 3 layers of cotton fabric and ear loops (Hanes Defender), which blocked 51%. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (Lindsley, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). It should be noted that the cotton cloth mask tested did not have an outer layer made of hydrophobic material (such as polypropylene or polyester) as recommended by WHO. If wearing a neck gaiter, make sure it fits securely and consider choosing one with an adjustable cord, to help prevent it from falling down (off of the nose and mouth) during strong sudden movements, such as during a sneeze.\n\n\n\nWhich masks protect you best?\n\n\n\nA study that evaluated how well masks protect the wearer from breathing in small particles (ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.6 microns) and factored in the fit of the mask as well as its filtration efficiency found that a NIOSH approved N95 (3M 9210) had the highest filtration efficiency at 98%, followed by 80% for a medical procedure mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health) with nylon hosiery placed over it, and 71.5% for a surgical mask with ties. [Note: The filtration efficiency of the medical procedure masks can range dramatically depending on how it was worn.] The filtration efficiency was 74% for a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops (Easy Masks LLC) with an aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert which, interestingly, had a slightly higher filtration efficiency after being washed once, 49.9% for a folded, cotton bandana, 39.3% for a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties (Renfro Corporation), 37.8% for a single-layer woven gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana MPUSA LLC), 28.6% for a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops (Red Devil Inc), and just 26.5% for a 3-layer woven cotton mask (100% cotton) with ear loops (Hanesbrands Inc) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\n\n\nBest Materials for Making Your Own Mask Filter\n\nAs discussed above, the WHO recommends that the middle layer of a cloth mask be made of a synthetic, nonwoven fabric such as polypropylene, or a second layer of cotton (high thread count cotton has been shown to have better filtration efficacy than lower-thread cotton). Many cloth masks that you can buy online come with a \"filter pocket\" as the middle layer, which you can buy pre-made filters for, or add your own. We've reviewed common materials for making mask filters, including Filti Face Mask Material and Medline Dry Baby Wipes, as well as materials such as polypropylene and other non woven fabrics (100% polypropylene, Pellon Sew-In Interfacing and Oly*fun), cotton and quilter's cotton. Sign in as a member or join now to see our reviews and more details about materials for making your own mask filters.\n\n\n\nHow Cloth, N95, KN95 and other Masks Compare\n\nAs noted above, well-constructed cloth masks may reduce your risk of exposure to virus-containing particles, but their main purpose is to help protect others from potentially infectious particles that you may emit. They generally do not provide the same level of protection to the wearer as N95 or KN95 respirators. The extent to which cloth masks can filter particles (filtration efficiency) can vary widely depending on the type of fabrics used, the number of layers, and the fit. Cloth masks are also not held to the same standards as N95 and KN95 respirators, as they do not have to be tested by a government agency or meet standardized criteria in order to be sold. If you choose a cloth mask, be sure to it meets basic CDC and WHO guidelines. You can also look for cloth masks that has been tested and shown to meet voluntary ASTM standards. A cloth mask that has received a \"Level 2\" designation has been shown to have a particulate filtration efficiency \"of at least 50%.\"\n\n\n\nIn comparison, NIOSH approved particulate N95 respirators have been tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the U.S. CDC. They must meet certain minimum criteria, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, an inhalation resistance of < 25 mm H20 and an exhalation resistance of <35 mm H20 (these are measures of how difficult is to breath in and out while wearing the respirator). Unlike cloth masks, NIOSH approved N95s are also required to attach to the head with head straps, rather than ear loops, as head straps can provide a more secure fit and reduce gapping.\n\n\n\nKN95 respirators, the Chinese \"equivalent\" of N95 respirators, must meet similar standards, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, and limits for inhalation and exhalation resistance. They are not required to have head straps (most have ear loops), although some do. Be aware that, during the pandemic, there have been many reports of counterfeit KN95s sold in the U.S., so you need to be careful where you buy KN95s.\n\n\n\n(For more about the differences between N95s and KN95s and quality concerns, see Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s?).\n\n\n\nSign in to see CL's Reviews of Popular N95 Respirators.\n\nBest Cloth Masks You Can Buy\n\nIf you prefer to purchase a cloth mask, we reviewed many masks sold online and identified several that we believe best meet WHO guidelines and/or are constructed with materials that offer a good combination of filtration efficacy and breathability. We also considered features that can affect fit and comfort, such as adjustable/bendable nose wires and adjustable straps, which can be particularly important for people who wear glasses or hearing aids. We also reviewed oversized masks designed to accommodate beards or to be used when singing, and masks with clear panels to enable lip reading by others.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we assessed eyeglass fogging with each mask when worn in cool air.\n\n\n\nOur list starts with our overall Top Pick for quality, comfort and breathability, fit, and minimal eyeglass fogging. This is followed by our next favorites, as well as masks for those who need clear panels. In our review of masks, we considered those from Allet, Atelier, Giftington, Graf Lanzt, LA Linen, Proper Cloth, Rafi Nova, Stark's, Tom Bihn, Vertex, Vida, Vistaprint, and masks sold on Etsy.\n\n\n\nBe aware that there is a shipping fee for most masks, calculated before check out based on location and/or other factors. Most companies provide an estimated time for the product to ship, but delivery time will depend on the shipping option you choose. ConsumerLab.com derives no revenue from sales of these products.\n\n\n\n(To see our list of the best cloth masks you can buy, sign in. If you are not a ConsumerLab member, join now.)\n\nHow to reduce air leakage around a mask\n\nAir leakage around a mask reduces the level of protection it provides you and those around you. There are several ways to reduce air leakage, as discussed below. Also be aware that if you are infectious, the area of your face beyond a leak, including eyeglasses, may become contaminated due to exhaled droplets, as demonstrated in OSHA study (Stephenson, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nKnotting ear loops\n\nThe fit and filtration efficiency of medical procedure masks with ear loops can be significantly improved by knotting the ear loops and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (see illustration), according to research conducted on manikins by the CDC. This was shown to reduce exposure to aerosols from a cough by 64.5%.\n\nDouble masking\n\nWearing a medical mask (i.e., a blue \"procedure\" mask) under a cloth mask improves protection, (likely by minimizing leaks between the medical mask and skin), but wearing a medical mask over a cloth mask has less benefit. A study found that wearing a medical mask under a cloth mask increased the filtration efficiency of cloth masks (which, alone, were 41 to 44% efficient), as well as medical masks (which, alone, were 43 to 62% efficient). Adding a medical mask beneath a cloth mask increased fitted filtration efficiencies to 66% for a simple cotton ear-loop mask, 77% for a cotton bandana, and 81% for a gaiter. Doubling a medical mask was not as effective, nor was doubling cloth masks \u2014 which also reduced breathability (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2021).\n\nNose wires\n\nBe aware that, while adding a nose wire to masks can improve their fit (and therefore, possibly reduce air leakage and improve protection). They seem to be of benefit with stiffer masks but; but not with masks made with stretchy or more flexible material (O'Kelly, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\nTry not to bend over while wearing a mask\n\nResearchers at Columbia University who were fit testing N95 respirators found that normal breathing and talking did not negatively affect mask fit, and turning the head from side to side slightly improved fit (perhaps due to tightening). However, moving the head up and down slightly worsened fit, and bending over decreased proper fit by as much as 50%. The researchers suggested kneeling rather than bending over when wearing a mask (Chen, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nMask fitters\n\nMasks fitters are a \"frame\" that can be placed over masks to improve the fit and \"seal\" of the mask against the face to reduce air leakage and increase inhalation filtration efficiency. Using mannequins that could \"breathe,\" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that placing either of two marketed mask fitters over a variety of masks increased inhalation filtration efficiencies from just 7% without the fitter to 26% for a 4-ply cotton mask, from 52% to 63% for a 3-ply spunbond polypropylene mask, from 44% to 91% for a surgical mask, and from only 18% up to as much as 95% for a 3-ply disposable non-medical mask with a melt-blown polypropylene center. Sign in to learn make a mask fitter at home or buy either of the two used in the study.\n\n\n\nNylon stockings\n\nAnother way to reduce air leaks was suggested by a study at Northeastern University in Boston, which showed that pulling an 8 to 10-inch tube of nylon (cut from a queen-sized nylon stocking) down over a regular mask and to the top of the neck. This significantly prevented air leakage around the mask and improved particle filtration efficiency, making the combined masking nearly as effective as an N-95 respirator which, unlike a medical mask, has an electrostatic charge and is specifically designed to prevent air leakage (Mueller, medRxiv 2020 --preprint; Godoy, NPR.org 4/22/20).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a study found that adding a sleeve of nylon hosiery over a medical procedural mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health Inc) increased its overall filtration efficiency from just 38.5% to 80%. Other techniques that created a better fit for the procedure mask to reduce air leakage included tying the ear loops and tucking in the side pleats (see video demonstration), which increased filtration efficiency to 60.3%, or securing the ear loops with ear guards (61.7%), a hair clip (64.8%) or placing three rubber bands across the front of the mask and looped on the ears (78.2%) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\nHow to reduce eyeglass fogging from masks\n\nOur tests indicated that eyeglasses were less likely to fog in cool air with masks that 1) came up higher on the nose and cheeks (allowing glasses to sit over the edge of the mask 2) had a bendable top frame that could be contoured for a close fit around the nose and cheeks, 3) had adjustable ear or head bands, allowing the mask to be tight against the face, and 4) had an outer layer of 100% polyester or chiffon rather than a cotton or cotton/polyester blend. Find out which masks had the least fogging.\n\n\n\nLens fogging may also be minimized by rinsing lenses with highly diluted liquid soap and then air drying (stand lenses up so excess drips off) (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). This leaves a surfactant film that reduces surface tension and causes water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer, reducing fogging (Margrain, Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2011). Anti-fogging sprays and wipes are also sold, but be sure to follow directions and allow liquids to dry before wearing to avoid eye irritation or injury from the liquid. (A CL member reported severe eye irritation after using JAWS Spit Gel which seems to have gotten into his eye after a COVID nasal test that caused eye tearing) (Peng, Cornea 2006). Eye injury has also been reported in healthcare workers in China who used anti-fog spray on medical goggles (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020).\n\n\n\nSingle-sided and double-sided tape strips can also be used to seal the edges of masks around the eyes and nose to reduce fogging. ConsumerLab purchased two tape strip products sold on Amazon, MaskTite Adhesive Strips and Cabeau Tape. We tried each with the masks in this review, and with a disposable mask, while wearing glasses. [Sign in to see our reviews of these tapes and our mask reviews.]\n\nHow to clean a cloth mask\n\nThe CDC advises that cloth masks be washed daily (and after high exposure) with soap and water. The agency also suggests each person have at least two cloth masks, likely so that one can be used while the other is being cleaned. It notes that \"cloth can be used for an extended period as long as they are not wet or soiled, but do not reuse them unless washed and cleaned.\" Masks should not be worn while still wet, as the agency states that the filtration effectiveness may be reduced. The FDA recommends choosing a cloth mask that can be washed and machine dried without damage or change in shape.\n\n\n\nCloth masks can be washed in a washing machine. They can also be cleaned using heat, but a washing machine is preferred. Silk and chiffon fabrics may need to be hand washed with cold water.\n\n\n\nIf you've purchased a mask, check with the fabric manufacturer or see the care instructions on the label. If hand washing is required, be sure to use adequate soap/detergent and rinse thoroughly, as soap helps to break down the lipid layer that allows SARS-Cov-2 to attach to surfaces. Some sturdier silk and chiffon blends, such as poly-spandex-chiffon, can be machine washed with warm water and tumbled dry if placed in a mesh bag for delicates.\n\n\n\nRe-using N95s?\n\nCurrently, the CDC recommends re-using a single N95 respirator no more than five times. It also advises healthcare workers \"wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs,\" noting that this \"will provide some time for pathogens on it to \"die off\" during storage.\"\n\n\n\nA study of 3M N95 respirators (dome-shaped duckbill models) worn by healthcare workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital caring for COVID-19 patients found that all N95s worn less than 12 times (and stored between uses) passed seal check and fit testing. Even when used about 40 times, 83% still passed these tests. The study implied that the masks had not been subject to decontamination procedures but they may have been somewhat protected from pathogen contamination as they were typically worn with face shields (Fabre, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nPreventing mask-related skin irritation and acne\n\nKeeping masks clean can also help prevent skin irritation, acne, and other skin conditions that can be caused by or exacerbated by wearing a mask, including eczema (contact dermatitis), rosacea, and folliculitis (inflammation/infection of hair follicles). Although the term \"maskne\" has become a common term to describe skin irritation and eruptions after wearing masks, contact dermatitis appears to be the most common skin irritation associated with wearing masks. All of these conditions can be aggravated by humidity within the mask, increased bacterial load on the skin, and friction from mask material. In addition to replacing and/or cleaning masks regularly, dermatologists recommend applying light moisturizer 30 minutes before putting on your mask and maintaining good oral hygiene to help minimize the risk of skin irritation. You can find more information and the full list of tips for skin care when wearing masks in this article (see \"General measures to prevent PPE related facial dermatoses\") (Rud, BMJ 2021).\n\nEffect on breathing function and potential carbon dioxide buildup\n\nWhen wearing an N95 respirator or a well-fitted mask with high blocking efficiency there can be some carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask over time (Sinkule, Ann Occup Hyg 2013). According to researchers at Stanford University, N95 masks are \"are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That's significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\" However, a small study in the U.S. found that wearing an N-95 mask for up to one hour did not cause any significant adverse effects in healthy healthcare workers performing moderate activities, despite significantly decreased inhaled oxygen and increased inhaled carbon dioxide levels (Roberge, Respir Care 2010). A representative from the CDC told Reuters.com that \"...the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia [elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide].\"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, surgical masks (also known as medical masks), which are inherently not as well-fitting as N95 respirators, do not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency, as noted by the World Health Organization. Several studies have demonstrated this. For example, a study among 20 healthy adults showed that moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill) for one hour while wearing a surgical mask led to only slight, clinically non-significant changes in CO2 levels (as measured on the skin) compared to exercise without a mask (Respir Physiol Neurobiol 2012). Even during vigorous exercise (cycling to exhaustion, an average of about 10 minutes) a study among 14 healthy men and women showed that wearing a disposable surgical mask or a three-layer cloth mask (Washable 3D Face Mask, TriMax Sports Inc. \u2014 made with bamboo charcoal cloth, non-woven fabric, and Lycra) had no effect on blood or muscle oxygenation or exercise performance compared exercising without a mask (Shaw, Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020).\n\n\n\nFurthermore, a study of 10 healthcare workers (including individuals with controlled asthma and four smokers), found that wearing a surgical mask (AFLUID, made of three layers of polypropylene and one layer of liquid resistant polyethylene) continuously for four hours did not reduce breathing function (Ciocan, Med Lav 2020). Additionally, older adults who wore a three-layer disposable nonmedical face mask with ear loops (Boomcare DY95 model, Deyce Leather Co Ltd) for one hour showed no decline in self-reported blood oxygen levels (as measured by pulse oximeter) (Chan, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother study showed that, even among older adults (average age 71) with breathing difficulty due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wearing a surgical mask during a six-minute walk test did not result in any major changes in CO2 retention (Samannan, Ann Am Thorac Soc 2020). The researchers suggested that discomfort while wearing a surgical mask might be caused by the increased warmth of facial skin and inhaled air inside the mask, which may trigger sensations of anxiety or claustrophobia in some people.\n\n\n\nThe CDC advises that face masks should not be placed on children under the age of two, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who would not be able to remove the mask without assistance.\n\nInhalation of microplastics and OPEs\n\nConcern has been raised about the risk of inhaling microplastic particles when wearing a mask made of polypropylene or other materials containing plastics. A study in China found that most masks increased the inhalation of fiber-like microplastics but notably decreased the risk of inhalation of spherical particles. While some evidence has suggested that fiber-like microplastics may be more toxic to animals than spherical microplastics (Ziajahromi, Environ Sci Technol 2017), the investigators concluded that, overall, inhalation of microplastics from masks is a small problem compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19 without a mask, as people already regularly inhale high amounts of microplastics from the air, with or without a face mask.\n\n\n\nThe study found that only N95 respirators reduced the risk of inhaling fiber-like microplastic particles compared to not wearing a mask, while a nonwoven mask, a fashion mask, and a cotton mask increased it by 17%, 41%, and 54%, respectively, surgical masks increased it by about 4% to 73%, and activated charcoal mask increased it by 117%. Inhalation of spherical microplastic particles was reduced by about 47% to 96% for all masks compared to not wearing a mask.\n\n\n\nDisinfecting any of the masks with UV irradiation, alcohol, air blower treatment, washing with soap and water, or exposure to sunlight increased the microplastic inhalation risk compared to untreated masks, although the risk was only small following washing with water and was lowest following exposure to sunlight. Alcohol disinfection increased the risk of microplastic inhalation most significantly (Li J Hazard Mater 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and other plastic materials used to make KN95 respirators, medical, surgical and other types of masks are often treated with organophosphate esters (OPEs) which, at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure to OPEs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact have been linked with cancer and other adverse effects. Sign in to the full answer to see what researchers found when they looked at the risk of inhaling OPEs when wearing masks.\n\nAre KN95 respirators as good as N95s?\n\nN95 and KN95 masks (or, more technically, respirators) are designed to protect you, as well as others around you. Both are supposed to filter 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns. However, as discussed below, this isn't always the case with widely sold KN95 masks (which are designed to meet Chinese, rather than U.S. specifications). In addition, while N95 respirators attach with head bands to help ensure the best fit, most KN95s attach with ear loops, which may cause a loose or improper fit, and allow for air leakage. A study of N95 and KN95 respirators have shown that mask performance depends, in part, on the tightness of the contact between the material and the facial skin and masks that tied around the head outperform those with elastic ear loops (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2020). As discussed above, how you move while wearing a mask may also affect fit.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, due to the previous shortage of N95 masks, in April 2020 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provided guidance that KN95 masks certified to China's GB2636 standards of 2006 or 2019 (imprinted on masks as \"GB2626-2006\" or \"GB2626-2019\") \"will provide greater protection than surgical masks (i.e., facemasks, other than surgical N95s[3]), homemade masks, or improvised mouth and nose covers, such as bandanas and scarves.\" Caution: You should not buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it.\n\n\n\nTests of KN95s from China by the CDC show that the filtration efficacy of some KN95 masks is 95% or higher but can be as low as 5.3%. Furthermore, tests by ECRI, an independent, U.S. based non-profit organization that evaluates equipment for hospitals and healthcare systems, showed that 5 of 11 KN95s did not meet the filtration efficiency standard of 95%. ECRI also found large variations in filtration efficiencies of KN95s within the same lot from a single manufacturer, suggesting quality control issues. (You can download ECRI's test results, which includes manufacturer information and photos of the respirators tested by clicking on \"PPE Testing Report\" on this page on ECRI's site).\n\n\n\nBuying a KN95\n\nStarting in 2020, the FDA published and maintained a list of N-95 and KN95 respirators from China given emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA during the pandemic. However, as of July 6, 2021, due to the increased supply and availability of NIOSH-approved respirators, the FDA has revoked its authorization of non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China for healthcare workers. Respirators with previous EUA status may still be marketed to the general public, but must be labeled as face masks, rather than respirators.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On August 25, 2021, the FDA announced that federal approval of respirators made by particular manufacturer has been revoked due to concerns about the quality of the products. Sign in for the details.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best KN95 Mask\n\nN95 masks are currently very hard to find and purchase as they remain reserved for healthcare and frontline workers. In contrast, KN95 masks are widely available for purchase on websites such as Amazon. However, it can be very difficult to know if a KN95 mask is genuine and effective. We reviewed many KN95 masks sold on Amazon but found only one currently on the FDA's list of authorized respirators that we recommend, and we found two that should be avoided. We also found an FDA-authorized KN95 through an online direct distributor in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe CDC publishes a list and images of dozens of counterfeit and falsely marketed respirators. Signs of a counterfeit respirator include no approval number or NIOSH markings, decorative fabrics or add-ons, and claims of being approved for children.\n\n\n\nOther respirators\n\n\n\nBefore N95 respirators became more available, the United States Department of Labor, noted that healthcare workers who were unable to obtain N95 respirators could use R95, R99, P95, P99, P100 and others respirators. Like N95 masks, these are expected to filter out a minimum of 95% of particles of the most penetrating size, and those ending in a \"99\" or \"100\" filter out at least 99% or 99.97%, respectively, of such particles but can be more difficult to breathe through. R95 and P95 masks are typically used for protection when working with oil-based substances like fuel, paints, solvents, or pesticides. N95s are not resistant to oil, R95s are \"somewhat resistant\" and P95s are \"strongly resistant to oil or oil proof,\" as shown in the CDC's infographic about these types of masks. If considering an alternative respirator, make sure it is NIOSH approved. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when trying to protect others. (See a video demonstration by researchers at Florida Atlantic University of how aerosols can spread when coughing while wearing an N95 mask with a valve).\n\n\n\nKF94 respirators from Korea are often promoted as the Korean \"equivalent\" to N95 respirators, but this is not quite accurate. Although they can have relatively high filtration efficacy, KF94 masks are considered \"public use\" respirators and are not held to the same performance standards as Korea's Special 1st class \"occupational use\" respirators (which are considered to be roughly equivalent to NIOSH approved N95 masks). KF94 respirators are designed to have a filtration efficacy of 94%, and CDC tests of one brand of KF94 found its filtration efficacy to be even higher (99.85 to 99.94%). However, unlike all NIOSH-approved N95s (which attach with head bands), KF94 respirators attach with ear loops, which, the CDC points out, may compromise their fit and efficacy. The CDC did not perform fit testing on the KF94s it tested and noted a lack of information about manufacturing quality control. In addition, unlike surgical N95 respirators, KF94 respirators are not considered fluid resistant (Kim, J Korean Med Sci 2020).\n\n\n\nElectrical air purifying respirators that mimic powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are available on Amazon, ranging in price from about $60 to $100, but these devices would not be suitable for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. These devices include a portable high efficiency (HE) filter that can be connected to a face mask via a flexible hose/air duct to supply fresh air to the wearer. By ventilating air from the HE filter to the mask, these devices should create positive air pressure. This means that air exhaled by the wearer would leak out of the mask. Consequently, these devices might protect the wearer if the ventilation is strong enough, but they would not protect individuals nearby the wearer.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, unlike NIOSH-certified PAPRs, which are rated as being more effective than N-95 masks, available electrical air purifying respirators do not appear to be certified. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices even help protect the wearer. In addition, similar to other personal (\"wearable\") air purifiers, these devices might not be permitted on airplanes, as security officers can confiscate these devices if they feel they are unsafe or cause a threat.\n\n\n\nAre copper masks better?\n\n\n\nCopper has been shown to inactivate a wide variety of bacteria and some viruses, typically within minutes to hours of contact, and a study found that SARS-CoV-2 (at about 72\u00b0F and 40% relative humidity) was undetectable on copper after four hours (van Dormalen, NEJM (correspondence) 2020). There do not appear to be studies showing how effective masks made with copper or copper infused fabric are against SARS-Cov-2. However, preliminary research with other viruses suggests a possible benefit. A study funded by the maker of copper masks (Cupron) for healthcare and institutional use, showed that an N95 mask with two added layers of copper oxide infused material (polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight/weight copper particles) had a similar filtering efficacy as a regular N95 mask, but was much more effective in inactivating human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) (Barkow, PLoS One 2010). A University of Massachusetts Amherst microbiologist developed a reusable mask made of 99.95% pure copper mesh, which, according to a university news release, was shown to \"kill 90% of microbes within five minutes of contact.\" In Hong Kong, the government is distributing fabric masks to the public that contain copper, known as the CuMask+ (Parry, BMJ 2020). According to the manufacturer, CuMask+ is made up six layers, \"two of which are specially made with small quantities of copper.\" Tests published by the company suggest it retains antiviral activity with up to 60 washes (handwashed with soap and cold water). If you use a copper-containing mask, be sure to clean it regularly and according to the product instructions: Bacteria and viruses can cling to dirt or other particles on copper, making it less effective (Grass, Appl Environ Microbiol 2011).\n\n\n\nSome concerns have been raised about the safety of copper masks and the possibility of breathing in copper particles. While we don't have safety information for specific products, laboratory studies that measured the amount of copper released from copper oxide impregnated masks during 5 hours under simulated breathing conditions was far below the respiratory copper permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by the USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") (Borkow, Curr Chem Biol 2012).\n\n\n\nHow to protect yourself from COVID-19 in a car\n\n\n\nPreliminary research suggests that viral loads can quickly build up within a closed car, even during rides as brief as 15 minutes. Wearing a mask, as well as a face shield, are good first steps to help protect yourself and others. When there are two people in a car (one driver and one passenger) seating the passenger in the back seat on the opposite side of the driver creates the most distance between them. To increase ventilation, computer modeling research shows that riding with all windows down is most effective. Since this isn't always practical, the next most effective way to increase ventilation is by opening one window in the back and one in the front, opposite of where the occupants sit, creating airflow across the interior of the car. Keeping all the windows closed and running the air-conditioning, is least effective (Mathai, Sci Adv 2020). Keep in mind that none of these steps eliminate the risk of infection.\n\n\n\nHow to improve safety for bus passengers and drivers\n\n\n\nA study of aerosol flow on a school bus and transit bus that were driven under real-world conditions showed that mask wearing and ventilation can significantly reduce exposure to aerosols for passengers (Edwards, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Based on their experiments, the researchers recommended the following tips to help reduce exposure to aerosols for bus passengers:\n\nRequire all passengers and drivers to wear masks on buses. Even a cloth mask that's 50% efficient can reduce particles released from a cough by 50% and reduce their dispersal by several feet.\n\nOpen windows partially or fully. This can reduce airborne particles by 50% to 80%.\n\nConsider seating arrangements that only allow for same household or same cohort passengers to sit together.\n\nSocial distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses, but any extra distance allows the air movement to reduce exposure to infectious particles.\n\nFor bus drivers, the researchers recommended risk could be reduced by using a dashboard fan to create airflow in the driver seat area. They also noted that, when safe to do so, opening all transit bus doors at every stop would allow for better air exchange.\n\n\n\nWhat masks protect against wildfire smoke?\n\n\n\nCloth masks, including those with sewn-in or removable filters, should not be relied on for protection from wildfire smoke, according to the CDC. They protect against some of the larger particles in wildfire smoke, but not from smaller particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. In addition, one-strap paper dust masks and surgical masks, worn alone, are not recommended for wildfire smoke protection.\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that people who have to be outdoors in wildfire affected areas wear fit-tested, NIOSH-approved N95 or P100 respirators, and the CDC notes that properly fitted N95 respirators can \"provide protection from wildfire smoke and from COVID-19 for the individuals wearing them.\" To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others, N95 masks without valves are recommended. If an N95 mask with a valve is your only option for wildfire smoke protection, consider covering the valve with tape or wearing a surgical mask over the N95 when around others, as recommended by John Balms, M.D. at UCSF. According to the CDC, KN95 respirators can also provide protection from wildfire smoke, and advises looking for a KN95 that meets requirements similar to those set by the CDC's NIOSH (see our Top Pick among KN95 masks, which was tested by the CDC)."

        "How & Where to Get Coronavirus (COVID-19) Tests",
        "Answer:\n\nBefore we get into specifics, let's start with a quick overview of the types of tests for coronavirus.\n\n\n\nTypes of COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nThere are basically two types of tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19:\n\n\n\nVirus test\n\nThis test detects the virus (SARS-CoV-2) to help determine if you have a current infection. Although you can be infectious before showing any symptoms, the virus is best detected during the first week of symptoms (which is about two weeks after becoming infected from exposure) (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nThere are two type of virus tests: the PCR and antigen test. Early in the pandemic, both tests had to be performed in a laboratory or clinic with special rapid, portable machines, but rapid, home-based PCR and antigen tests have become available. There are also at-home sampling kits by which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report PCR results back to you.\n\n\n\nVirus tests are typically done by collecting a sample of mucous from a nose swab (typically from the nasopharynx or nostril) or saliva or oral swabs. There is some evidence that virus detection may be better with samples from saliva or the mouth or throat (Blythe, medRxiv 2021 \u2014 preprint; Wyllie, Correspondence in JAMA, 2020), but most tests (and all antigen tests) authorized for use in the U.S. rely on samples from the nose and the FDA has advised against using antigen tests designed for the nose to be used in the mouth. Nevertheless, a study in the Netherlands, showed that an antigen test (BD Veritor) was able to detect about 20% more positive cases using samples collected first from the throat (around the tonsils) and then from the nose than with samples just from the nose. The combined samples were also used on Roche's SD Biosensor (aka COVI9-19 At-Home Test) antigen test which was even more accurate than BD Veritor (Zwart, medRxiv 2022 -- preprint). (Interestingly, one antigen test in the UK utilizes a swab of the throat (tonsils) that is then used to swab one nostril.) An apparent benefit of sampling from the throat is that the virus appears at higher levels there about a day earlier than in the nose, although levels then rise higher in the nose and remain higher there for a longer period, as shown in a study of people in the UK given COVID-19 by being infected with virus in their nose (Killingly, In Review 2022 -- preprint). Using only a swab from the inside of the check, however, was shown to identify only 2 positive cases out of 22 that were positive with nostril swabs in a small study that used the Abbott BinaxNow antigen test (Schrom, medRxiv 2022 \u2014 preprint).\n\n\n\nThe PCR test uses a technique that amplifies genetic material (RNA) from the virus. This can take as little as a few minutes or several hours. The FDA has authorized at-home sampling kits with which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report the results back to you. It has also authorized at-home PCR tests that take about 20 to 60 minutes. Home PCR tests are more expensive than home antigen tests but may detect infections earlier than antigen tests. (Sign in to see our reviews of home PCR tests from Cue, Detect, and Lucira, and to see our Top Pick among these.)\n\n\n\nAn analysis of tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that the proportion of samples testing positive on PCR tests were twice as high at 2 pm than in the morning, decreasing later in the afternoon and evening. Researchers proposed this may indicate that test accuracy varies by time of day and could have public health implications (McNaughton, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nUpdate: In addition to the many commercial PCR tests that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the CDC has been producing its own, FDA-authorized, PCR test. More recently, the CDC developed a newer test that can simultaneously test for and distinguish between COVID, influenza A and influenza B, and, as of January 1, 2022, it will withdraw the older test. Sign in to find out why.\n\n\n\nThe antigen test identifies a protein (or \"antigen\") that is specifically found on the virus. Advantages of the antigen test are that it can provide results in as little as 15 minutes and can be produced at lower cost, lending itself to wider use in screening. In addition, only a nasal swab is needed from the nostrils, not a much deeper, nasopharyngeal swab. The downside with antigen tests is that they are more likely to provide a false negative result than a gene amplification test; that is, it's more likely to identify your sample as negative when you are actually positive. Consequently, negative results from an antigen test should be repeated within three days, but at least 36 hours later (or confirmed with a PCR test) for people who are at high-risk of infection \u2014 but a positive antigen result is highly likely to be accurate. False negatives may also occur with emerging viral variants, if the variants have significant mutations of the target antigen. However, most popular antigen tests in the U.S. target nucleocapsid antigen, which is still present in variants such as Delta and Omicron. Be aware of a common mistake made when reading rapid home antigen tests and that one of the chemicals in these tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\n\n\nSign in for details about benefits and limitations of rapid antigen testing for the Omicron variant.\n\n\n\nBe aware that one of the chemicals home antigen tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\nSeveral home antigen tests have been authorized by the FDA and are available, such as Abbott BinaxNow Self Test, BD Veritor, CLINITEST, Flowflex, iHealth, InteliSwab, On/Go (AccessBio CareStart), Roche At-Home, and Quidel QuickVue. However, there important differences in the accuracy of these tests, their shelf-lives and stability in freezing temperatures, and their cost. Also, versions of some of these tests have been recalled. [Sign in for our comparison of antigen tests and our Top Picks.]\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody test\n\nThis test detects antibodies to the virus and requires blood \u2014 either a drop or a vial \u2014 to determine if you have been infected in the past and have developed some level of immunity. This test (also called a serology test) can be run in a laboratory or on a test strip, although even test strips must be used in an authorized facility, not at home.\n\n\n\nAs it takes time to develop antibodies that can be detected, antibody tests are most accurate when performed at least 20 days after the first disease symptoms and may be most accurate (in terms of not missing antibodies that are present) 4 months or longer after a positive virus test. This was shown in study of 486 COVID patients in California in which the likelihood of a positive antibody (IgG) test result increased with time after a positive virus test. Antibody tests were most accurate (~80%) among those ages 40 to 59 years and least accurate (~65%) among those 70+ or under 40. The tests were more accurate for men than women (79% vs 72%) (Vashisht, JAMA Netw Open 2021).\n\n\n\nTests focus on levels of the antibody IgG, which persists without much decline for several weeks, but may include levels of IgM which fall off more rapidly (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). These tests look for antibodies to specific parts of the virus, namely its spike proteins (proteins on the outside of the virus that can bind to receptors on human cells) or nucleocapsid proteins (proteins inside the virus). An advantage to testing for antibodies to the nucleocapsid is that these antibodies can be easier to detect, however, antibodies to the spike proteins are believed to be more important in conferring immunity against the virus, as these antibodies may block viral entry into cells \u2014 although antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins may still serve as proxies for immunity. See Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test to learn which marketed tests target each protein.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not recommended that antibody tests be relied upon to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, be aware that only tests that focus on antibodies to spike protein would be useful for this purpose because the authorized vaccines generate antibodies only to spike proteins. A negative result on a nucleocapsid antibody test provides no information about the effectiveness of a vaccine although it would suggest that a person has not had COVD-19. The list of authorized antibody tests below indicates whether a test focuses on spike, nucleocapsid, or both types of proteins.\n\n\n\nIf, at some point, tests for spike protein antibodies are indicated for assessing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, those that provide a quantitative or semi-quantitative measurement, will be more useful than those that provide only a yes/no answer. Sign in for more information about antibody tests that focus on the spike protein and are semi-quantitative, including one that is available from a major U.S. laboratory.\n\n\n\nNote: Avoid taking large doses \u2014 10,000 mcg or more \u2014 of biotin (a B vitamin) for several days before an antibody test, as biotin may skew results.\n\nSign in to learn which tests may be affected by biotin.\n\nAnother way our bodies fight the virus is with T cells. Preliminary research suggests that even if antibody levels are too low to be detected, people previously infected with the virus may produce enough T cell response to provide immunity (Sekine, MediRxiv 2020). However, currently authorized tests do not measure this type of immunity, and one should still apply distancing and health precautions regardless of test results.\n\n\n\nSome labs may provide you with an index value that reflects the strength of the antibody signal produced from your test. Higher antibody levels generate higher signals and higher index values. The interpretation of these index values depends on the test used. For example, for a particular test the cut-offs could be \"less than 1.01\" for negative, \"1.01 to less than 1.21\" for indeterminate, and \"greater than or equal to 1.21\" for positive (Theel, J Clin Microbio 2020). Or, there could just be a single cut-off index value of, say, 1.40 for positive, with anything below being negative (Example: Abbott Alinity -- https://www.fda.gov/media/137910/download). If you would like to know your index value, be sure to check that the lab you use provides the value.\n\n\n\nWho is checking these tests?\n\nTo speed the availability of tests, rather than put these through its normal approval process, the FDA has provided a special emergency use allowance (EUA) for tests that, although imperfect, may be useful at this time. So there are actually no FDA \"approved\" SARS-CoV-2 virus tests, but a list of \"FDA authorized\" tests. The FDA allowances are based on data submitted by the test manufacturers, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government laboratories are now conducting independent tests of these tests and the FDA has been making the results public (see results in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section and watch for further announcements in our newsletter.)\n\n\n\nSeveral other organizations around the world have been testing the test and/or certifying virus and antibody tests. The European Union's has been certifying tests, conferring on them its CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark, and the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has been doing the same. Researchers in California, Denmark, and elsewhere have been testing the antibody tests.\n\n\n\nBe aware that in June 2020 the FDA warned consumers about at-home antibody tests being sold without FDA clearance or approval and issued warning letters to three companies selling these tests. Some of these tests were falsely labeled as FDA approved. [Update (August 19, 2020): The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that CLIA- certified laboratories are no longer required to notify the FDA, nor request its authorization, for tests they develop in-house. It is not clear what information about such tests will be maintained or published. This change could allow for novel tests to become available more quickly but eliminates oversight by the FDA, creating more of a buyer-beware situation. Labs may, voluntarily, still choose to apply to the FDA, and the FDA will continue to publish information about tests submitted this way. If in doubt, ask your doctor or lab if the test you are considering is authorized for use by the FDA. (Links to the FDA information are provided in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section.\n\n\n\nWhere to Get COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nVirus Test\n\nTo date, the FDA has permitted the use of over 90 virus tests. The vast majority must be performed on a sample collected in a medical setting, such as in a doctor's office, a diagnostic laboratory, or a drive-through facility, but the FDA has also begun authorizing at-home sample collection tests for the virus.\n\n\n\nLocal testing (often free)\n\nAlthough you can ask your doctor for a virus test, you may be able to arrange to get a virus test for free from your state or local government. You can also go to a diagnostic laboratory or testing center, including some pharmacies. The test may be covered by your insurance or the government based on an assessment of your risk level. Here are some examples of testing programs around the country.\n\nProject Baseline works with community based screening programs in locations in several states to offer free virus testing. You must fill out an online questionnaire and be accepted. You will then be given an appointment at local testing center where a sample will be collected with a self-nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. The project is sponsored by the parent company of Google through its health unit, Verily, and a Google email account is needed to complete questionnaire online.\n\nRite Aid Pharmacies in some locations are participating in Project Baseline, providing testing at no cost to anyone 18+ years of age.\n\nCVS (including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB) had originally offered drive-up, rapid testing using the Abbott ID NOW system, a small, portable device that yields results in 13 minutes or less. Unfortunately, this system was been reported to yield a high percentage of false negative results due to lower sensitivity than other systems. That is, a negative result may need to be confirmed using another test (Basu, bioRxiv 2020 preprint). (For more details, see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test , below). Virus testing is still offered, but specimens are now sent to independent, third-party labs for processing, and test results are available in approximately three to four days.\n\nWalgreens offers drive-up testing in which you perform your own nasal swab. You sample is sent to a laboratory and you are notified by email or phone when results are available. (Originally results were promised within 24 hours).\n\nKroger Health offers public drive-thru and walk-up COVID-19 testing.\n\n\n\nAt-home tests\n\nThe FDA has authorized several fully self-administered virus tests (providing rapid results) or test kits (to be sent into a lab) for use at home. Currently, two of these (Abbott BinaxNOW Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue) can be purchased at pharmacies and take about 15 minutes. Note that these will not provide you with a digital pass for events, airlines, or restaurants. Another version of the BinaxNOW Antigen test (the \"home\" version) provides a digital Navica pass, but this test must be purchased online (at about twice the cost) and many venues may not accept the digital pass.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On October 1, 2021, 200,000 test kits of another COVID-19 home test were recalled due to a manufacturing defect causing false positive results (i.e., indicating that someone has COVID-19 when they do not). For details, including what to do if you've used this home test, sign in to the full answer, which also includes details about four other currently available at-home tests.\n\n\n\nAntibody Test\n\nAs with virus tests, many laboratories have received FDA approval to conduct antibody tests, some of which are very accurate. Although the FDA has not approved or authorized rapid, home tests for antibodies, many such tests are available in other parts of the world and some have been sold in the U.S. The FDA has authorized one rapid antibody test for use at point-of-care settings, i.e., non-laboratory medical settings such as in medical offices and pharmacies.\n\n\n\nThrough a local healthcare provider\n\nYour healthcare provider can arrange for you to get an antibody test if deemed appropriate. Blood would be drawn either by your provider or at nearby diagnostic laboratory. Similarly, many walk-in, urgent care centers can arrange for you to have the test, for a fee, which may be covered by your insurance. The samples are typically sent to a commercial laboratory, so results can take a few days.\n\n\n\nConsumer-initiated testing\n\nBe aware than in many cases, the cost of antibody tests may be covered by insurance if ordered by your physician or health care provider. Some labs will require payment for consumer-initiated tests, while others will bill your insurance. Be sure to check the payment policy of the lab you plan to use if requesting your own test. You can also check if your insurance company covers COVID-19 testing. Medicare often covers the full cost of COVID-19 virus and antibody tests. If you are uninsured, health care providers can submit a claim to have virus and antibody tests covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\n\n\nQuestDirect allows consumers to request a COVID-19 IgG antibody test and pay for it online ($119 plus a $10.30 physician oversight fee). An appointment is made for a blood draw at one of Quest Diagnostics 2,200 patient service centers and test results are available online one to two days later. Interested consumers must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days. Quest has stated that the testing will initially rely on antibody tests run on the Abbott Architect and EUROIMMUN systems.\n\n\n\nLabcorp also allows consumers to request a test directly through its website. According to the website, there is no up-front out-of-pocket cost for consumer initiated tests, but you will be charged a $10 fee for physician oversight services (there is no physician oversight fee if the test order comes directly from your own physician or healthcare provider). Labcorp will \"bill the cost of the COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly to your insurance carrier, or if uninsured, to the appropriate government program.\" Antibody tests offered by Labcorp include Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV02 (IgG), and DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n\nYou can see how each of these tests compare in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section below.\n\n\n\nRapid, home tests\n\nThe FDA has not yet approved or authorized of the use of any rapid, home antibody tests but several have been approved by the European Union, which provides its CE mark (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) and/or by the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA). In addition, research groups have been evaluating these tests. Some of these tests have been marketed in the U.S. without FDA approval or allowance.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best COVID-19 Test\n\n\n\nThere are now more than 90 virus tests (including a recently approved saliva test) and 22 antibody tests for COVID-19 authorized by the FDA. ConsumerLab has reviewed the data on their performance and assessed which appear to be the best antibody tests for COVID-19. We've added this information for ConsumerLab members. Sign in as a member or become a member now to learn how specific brands of virus and antibody tests compare, which currently appear to be the best, where to get them, and whether any of the tests can identify which variant caused an infection.\n\n\n\nWhat Does a Negative Antibody Test Mean?\n\nIf you took a coronavirus antibody test and it came back negative, it can mean one of several things:\n\nThe test was not sensitive enough to detect antibodies that existed. This is more likely if the test had a sensitivity of less than 100% (see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests);\n\nfor sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); You may have never had COVID-19;\n\nYou took the test too early -- generally less than 20 days after first disease symptoms, although, according to the CDC, some people may take longer; or\n\nYou didn't develop levels of antibodies high enough to be detected by tests -- which preliminary research suggests may happen in mild and asymptomatic cases (Long, Nature Med 2020).\n\nThere is currently not enough data to know if a negative result could result from taking the test too late. More research is needed to determine how long significant levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist.\n\n\n\nThe CDC cautions, \"Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\"\n\n\n\nThis article will be updated as new information is obtained."

        "Peril and Promise: Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Physical Sciences",
        "To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences.\n\nThe panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research.\n\n\n\nDownload the full report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists.\n\nThe physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point.\n\nIf we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous.\n\nThe physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.\n\nPandemic's Impact on the Physical Sciences Enterprise Panel Members\n\nChair\n\nJulia Phillips, Sandia National Laboratories (Retired)\n\nMembers\n\nSusan Avery, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Retired)\n\nJonathan Bagger, TRIUMF\n\nPhil Bucksbaum, Stanford University\n\nFrance C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation (Retired)\n\nEric Isaacs, Carnegie Institution\n\nVictor McCrary, University of the District of Columbia\n\nRobie Samanta Roy, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nCarl Wieman, Stanford University\n\nAIP Staff Liaisons\n\nMichael H.

        "New Face Mask Material Can Capture And Deactivate Coronavirus Particles",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic is by no means over, but as time goes on, scientists are learning more and more about the virus \u2013 and the various ways that we can protect against it, including new and improved face masks.\n\nA new membrane-based respiratory mask developed by researchers can capture and deactivate SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as it comes into contact with them. These spike proteins are what allow the virus to enter host cells once they're in the body.\n\nAs per tests, almost 99 percent of targeted airborne particles can be filtered out by the new mask, giving wearers a vital extra layer of protection when it comes to avoiding infection.\n\n\"This new material can filter out the virus like the N95 mask does, but also includes antiviral enzymes that completely deactivate it,\" says chemical engineer Dibakar Bhattacharyya from the University of Kentucky.\n\n\"This innovation is another layer of protection against SARS-CoV-2 that can help prevent the virus from spreading.\"\n\nAfter developing the membrane with a manufacturer, the researchers tested it using SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that had been immobilized on synthetic particles. It was able to stop coronavirus-sized aerosols from getting through while also destroying the spike proteins within 30 seconds of contact.\n\nThe membrane can be tweaked in terms of its thickness and porosity, leaving open the possibility of further improvements in the future. It means the type of particles filtered out by the membrane can be carefully controlled.\n\nAccording to the team, a mask using this membrane could be worn for two hours a day for several days without affecting breathability. That means masks don't have to be replaced as often, so fewer used masks need to be disposed of over time.\n\n\"The innovative development of smart filtration materials with low airflow resistance that can filter, capture, and deactivate aerosolized virus particles can provide immense human health and industrial workplace benefits,\" write the researchers in their published paper.\n\nThe protection factor offered by the new mask is higher than the N95 mask standard, which is certified as being able to filter out 95 percent of particles (hence the name). N95 masks have three or four fiber layers, plus an electrically charged filter layer.\n\nRight now, the N95 mask is the most commonly used in the healthcare industry, though there's still room for improvement. With their new mask, the researchers got to 98.9 percent for 100 nanometer aerosol particles (including those carrying SARS-CoV-2).\n\nWhat the researchers don't say is how long it's going to take to get this material from the lab into masks that you are actually able to go out and buy \u2013 though considering how effective it promises to be, we're hoping it's sooner rather than later.\n\n\"The use of respiratory face masks provides significant reduction of coronavirus spread, as viral spread has been proven to occur primarily via two modes of transmission: droplet spread and inhalation of infectious airborne aerosols,\" write the researchers.\n\nThe research has been published in Communications Materials."

        "Health and autonomy: How COVID has challenged already-tenuous balance among public health, religion and personal values",
        "E\n\nxactly two years ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. At the time, 118,000 cases and 4,000 deaths had been reported. Today, over 450 million people have been diagnosed, and over six million have died from the virus. As we turn to other pressing matters, we should pause and consider the effects of legal and policy implications on COVID management.\n\nSome countries are compelling COVID vaccination, e.g., Austria and France (at least for health care workers). Greece is fining people over 60 who refuse to get vaccinated; Italy has similar requirements for people over 50. In Hungary, vaccination is required for health workers, schoolteachers, and people working in state institutions. Similarly, COVID-19 vaccines will soon be mandatory for England\u2019s health and social care workers.\n\nOther countries, notably those in Scandinavia, favor individualized choice. Israel manifests a hybrid philosophy. While Israel does not require pre-school vaccinations, free access to societal experiences is restricted in Israel without proof of COVID vaccination.\n\nIn the US, one-quarter of the states have mandated vaccination for certain occupations. By comparison, half the states have enacted legislation precluding public health regulations regarding COVID. As I\u2019ve written, here Kansas has taken the anti-vax sentiment further, broadening religious exemptions for all vaccines, including those required for pre-school attendance implemented nationally since 1977. They are now talking about removing mandatory pre-school vaccinations entirely.\n\nBy comparison, six states have now eviscerated all non-medical exemptions, virtually compelling pre-school vaccination except for provable medical reasons. (It should be noted that vaccine mandates involve civil fines or monetary penalties. Coerced or forcibly vaccinating people is not a consideration, although it was unofficially and fairly widely used in the US in the late 1800s for smallpox [1].\n\nThese diverse reactions to mandatory vaccines appear to turn on:\n\nLocal experience with COVID and other infectious diseases\n\nCultural differences\n\nHistorical experience\n\nPolitical inclinations of the majority party (and voters)\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nHow societal views have changed\n\nAccording to a presentation at the 14th World Conference of Bioethics, Medical Ethics and Health Law, historically, the search for the common good and preservation of the species were guiding principles of governmental policy. Later, these sentiments were augmented by concepts of solidarity. These principles likely underscored the Supreme Court\u2019s 1904 decision of Jacobson v. Massachusetts allowing state-compelled vaccination of smallpox vaccines notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s contention that compelled vaccination violated his personal liberties.\n\nIn the decades following Jacobson, mass societal adherence to public health recommendations guided American behavior, exemplified by mass voluntary uptake of smallpox vaccines in 1947 and polio vaccination in the 1960s. Whether this societal acquiescence to medical recommendations was motivated by fear of disease, respect for the medical establishment, a sense of public duty, or a combination is unclear. This voluntary mass compliance obviated consideration of mandating vaccines \u2013 until the arrival of the anti-vax industry heralded by Andrew Wakefield in 1998 along with the emergence of a new focus on autonomy and individual rights \u2013 and the resulting re-emergence of once-eradicated diseases, such as measles.\n\nReligious rights\n\nToday, the notion of autonomy and individual rights are the driving force forging policy in many jurisdictions, now augmented by the championing of \u201creligious rights.\u201d Indeed, in a recent case concerning lockdown, Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, the newly minted Conservative majority of the Supreme Court (occasioned by the substitution of Justice Amy Coney Barrett for the deceased Ruth Bader Ginsburg) opined that public health recommendations cannot override religious rights \u2013 which the Court considered equally as important as activities specified as \u201cessential\u201d by the Governor.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court\u2019s veneration for religious rights does not seem to extend to vaccines. In Does v. Mills, the 1st Circuit refused to halt enforcement of a Maine law requiring COVID vaccination for health care workers notwithstanding religious objection. The Supreme Court effectively affirmed the decision.\n\nShockingly, at least to me, Justice Barrett, the swing vote in the Roman Catholic Church v. Cuomo, subscribed to the Does v. Mills decision rejecting religious exemptions for required COVID vaccination in health workers. The only sense I can make of her decision (which admittedly is couched in procedural terms) is that the objection to vaccination by the Roman Catholic plaintiff was based on the claim that fetal cell lines using aborted cells were involved in testing and developing the mRNA vaccines and producing the J&J vaccines.\n\nThat objection would not resound with Justice Barrett, a devout Catholic, when the Pope specifically approved COVID vaccine use, even if derived from aborted fetuses. As reported by Vatican News:\n\nThe Vatican says that it\u2019s \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d to receive a vaccination for COVID-19, even if the vaccine\u2019s research or production involved using cell lines derived from aborted fetuses, given the \u201cgrave danger\u201d of the pandemic.\n\nThe Vatican position extends beyond COVID vaccines:\n\nAll vaccinations recognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience with the certain knowledge that the use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive.\n\nFrom a social perspective, however, White evangelical Protestants frequently differ from their Church\u2019s teaching. This is \u201cthe only religious group that didn\u2019t reach a majority when asked \u2026 if they believe they should get vaccinated because it \u201chelps protect everyone\u2026 and is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe position was echoed by Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, again manifesting the mangling and mixing of politics and religion in policy formation, also seen in the Roman Catholic Church case where the Christian-conservative majority refused to countenance public health measures restricting access to mass \u2013 even in heavily infected areas where other activities they deemed less important were allowed.\n\nIndeed,\n\nThe only Christian denominations who cite a theological reason for opposing vaccines are the Dutch Reformed Church and Church of Christ, Scientist\u2026\n\naccording to Vanderbilt University Medical Center research.\n\nThis brings us back to the Kansas legislation and forecasted plans. Given the lack of recognized religions with stated objections to vaccinations, the Kansas decision more accurately reflects political misappropriation of religion rather than religious doctrine itself. Interestingly, Kansas claims a White Evangelical Protestant religious majority population of 31%, signaling the political bias of the move.\n\nConsistency of results or cacophony of decisions?\n\nThe variation in jurisdictional response when religion transects public health decision-making and the comingling of religion and policy-making is not an anomaly- domestically and internationally. However, its significance is far more critical when it comes to infectious disease, directly impacting disease incidence. And disease in one area of the world quickly becomes a seed for epidemics someplace else.\n\nVariability in state resolution of addressing the circumnavigating navigating epidemic presents both options and problems. Thus, COVID restrictions in one state can be avoided by traveling to a neighboring locale. Mandatory vaccination of children in the six states eviscerating religious objections can be circumvented by moving to another state or home-schooling. Some say that national requirements are required to address discrepancies. Others say local (and state) determinations are necessary to address local conditions. The latter makes more sense if the decision is predicated on scientific and public-health rubrics.\n\nBut serious considerations should be given when states remove vaccine requirements that facilitate transportation of epidemic-prone diseases across state lines. The implications of such laws seem to have been ignored by Kansas legislators.\n\nHave they considered whether neighboring states would ban entry to Kansans when vaccine requirements are removed or attenuated, effectively quarantining them? Nothing prevents a state from imposing quarantine regulations restricting access to Kansans (or any other state). Rhode Island\u2019s Gov. Gina Raimondo threatened to do just this New Yorkers during COVID\u2019s initial heyday. And this is not a new response. During cholera and yellow fever epidemics of the late 1800s, involuntary quarantine across state lines were held constitutional.\n\nThe implications of divergent directives\n\nWhat is happening reflects an outcome-determinative orientation: What the power-elite prefers will drive the decision, regardless of scientific basis or health-related evidence. The basis of their decision is irrelevant. Thus, if the autonomy of their constituents is the priority of their voters, governors will eschew masks and mandates; if attendance at mass is a concern, jurists will support the pre-eminence of religion; if vaccination is important and does not violate the jurist\u2019s personal beliefs, religious objections will be dismissed. When personal choice becomes a driving force\u2013 consideration of the profound impact of this decision on society is avoided.\n\nThe implications are dire.\n\nGlobally, the variation in vaccine uptake is significant. When citizens remain at home or adhere to worldwide travel restrictions, the impact of the unvaccinated is contained. But reliance on that assumption is folly. Consider Ukraine, which boasts one of the lowest COVID vaccination rates globally (35%). Who knows what impact that might have in resurrecting increasingly dormant COVID rates in those countries accepting refugees? And this is not a theoretical concern. The measles pandemic of 2018-2019 was largely seeded by Ukrainian cases, manifesting their low vaccine rates generally.\n\nAnother example: There has always been anti-vax sentiment in Israel. But following the emergence of the anti-vax industry in Israel, my research reveals that the prevalence of anti-vaxxers more than doubled [2] \u2013 along with the epidemics of infectious disease and pockets of COVID vaccine refusal in these enclaves. Ensuing maternal sentiment rejecting vaccination instigated a massive measles epidemic in Israel in 2018-2019, sickening 4300 and claiming three lives- a real harm not just to their children \u2014 but to society at large.\n\nLast week two cases of polio were reported in Israel, along with scores more exposed youth and a fear of more cases arising. The disease has not been seen in the country in more than 30 years.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens when the anti-vax industry seizes the public imagination, and people don\u2019t get vaccinated. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t happen in Kansas.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Pox \u2013 An American History by Michael Willrich [2] Barbara Pfeffer Billauer, Muzzling Anti-Vaxxer FEAR Speech: Overcoming Free Speech Obstacles with Compelled Speech University of Miami Law Review\n\nDr. Barbara Pfeffer Billauer, JD MA (Occ.

        "Podcast: Guardian\u2019s glyphosate hysteria debunked; Intensive farming and pandemics; Where did dogs come from?",
        "T\n\nhere\u2019s probably minute quantities of weedkiller in your urine. Should you panic? No. Will technological advances in farming reduce or amplify the risk of another pandemic? A new study offers some helpful insights. Finally, we\u2019re getting closer to pinning down the evolutionary origins of modern dogs.\n\nJoin geneticist Kevin Folta and GLP contributor Cameron English on episode 178 of Science Facts and Fallacies as they break down these latest news stories:\n\nGlyphosate detected in 80% of urine? Reason for alarm or deceptive data distortion? A recent study found that 80 percent of people have detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine. The result set off a media firestorm, led by Guardian contributor Carey Gillam, a longtime critic of the widely used weedkiller. News reports emphasized just how \u201cdisturbing\u201d the study\u2019s result was, but none of the media coverage appropriately contextualized the data. Should we really be worried that small quantities of glyphosate show up in our urine? Viewpoint: Anti-technology activists claim coronavirus outbreaks could be exacerbated by intensive farming. Here\u2019s why they are dead wrong Environmental groups routinely assert that \u201cindustrial\u201d farming could unleash another pandemic by committing additional land to agriculture and herding domesticated animals in confined spaces. This combination, activists say, boosts our exposure to exotic animals and the viruses they harbor and encourages their spread among animals we raise for food production. While this threat is real, it has been exaggerated as part of an effort to oppose technological advances in farming. In fact, it is those innovations that will help us prevent the next pandemic. We finally know how modern dogs arose from ancient wolf populations It\u2019s well known that dogs are descended from grey wolves, though their ancestry is much more complicated that we thought, according to research just published in Nature. The authors examined 72 genomes from ancient wolves going back 100,000 years and compared these with genomes of the dog breeds we keep as pets today. Conclusion: dogs are most similar to ancient Siberian wolves, but they likely descended from two different wild populations, one from Asia and the other from Europe. The results suggest that humans domesticated dogs before the advent of agriculture, but important question have yet to be answered. \u201cWe still can\u2019t tell whether there were two independent domestication events followed by merging of those two populations, or if there was just a single domestication process, followed by mixing from wild wolves,\u201d Dr Anders Bergstr\u00f6m, first author of the research at the Francis Crick Institute, told The Guardian. Future research will have to pin down the geographical origins of modern dogs, he added.\n\nKevin M. Folta is a professor, keynote speaker and podcast host.

        "\u2018Disconnection, isolation, depression\u2019: Long COVID has heightened our awareness of the critical role sense plays in life",
        "V\n\nivian,* a Washington, D.C.\u2013based art curator, realized she had COVID-19 in December 2020. \u201cI bought a tree, and I brought it home,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd I thought,\n\nFor Vivian, the moment involved more than frustration about a \u201cbad tree.\u201d Her loss of smell left her unable to conjure memories and even affected her sense of self.\n\n\u201cThat Christmas was really hard,\u201d she says. \u201cThat pine smell that I love, that I associate with childhood and my father \u2026 it\u2019s gone. You want to grasp something, and you are grasping nothingness. It affects my sense of personhood. I\u2019m still who I am, but there is something that has left that is very vital to my life.\u201d\n\nThe number of people experiencing lost or distorted olfaction has risen astronomically during the COVID-19 pandemic. One study indicates that as many as 62 percent of patients who tested positive for the virus experienced smell loss (known clinically as anosmia).\n\nMany people with anosmia suffer feelings of disconnection, isolation, and depression. When COVID-19 robbed Abra, a San Francisco\u2013based communications manager, of her sense of smell, \u201call the color was taken out of life,\u201d she says. Abra was fortunate and slowly started to regain her sense of smell. But many people remain in a scentless world years after their diagnosis.\n\nThe profound impact that smell loss has on people\u2019s lives underscores how central olfaction is to the human experience. Though COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on smell, anthropologists have spent decades sniffing out the nuances of this mysterious and powerful sense: how it connects to our evolution, our memories, our cultural diversity, and our emotional well-being.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine?

While many people can discriminate between several million colors and nearly half a million different auditory tones, we can smell more than a trillion odors.\n\nSmell \u201chas this infinite dimensionality,\u201d says Matthew Cobb, an evolutionary neurobiologist at the University of Manchester. Yet smell remains distinctly enigmatic, he adds. \u201cWe understand how vision works, how hearing works, and more or less how taste works, how touch works, but not smell. We don\u2019t know what the rules are.\u201d\n\nOlfaction is one of the first senses that evolved, and it\u2019s an essential element of survival for many creatures. It directs organisms toward food and mates, and away from threats such as toxins and predators. \u201cWe rely on odors as a clue that something is going wrong,\u201d says Kara Hoover, a biological anthropologist at the University of Alaska.\n\nMelissa, a New York\u2013based podcaster, realized how crucial scent is for safety when she lost her sense of smell. \u201cI kept burning stuff on the stove,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve sent rotten turkey to school with my kid. I have thought, What if I end up dying because I can\u2019t smell something dangerous, like knowing whether you are going to burn the house down? I\u2019ve literally almost done it three times. There are flames, and I\u2019m just sitting in the other room.\u201d\n\nHumans can even smell fear\u2014an important social clue that a threat is nearby. In one study, researchers collected sweat from participants who watched a comedy and a scary film. Another group of subjects could often correctly identify the sweat from frightened film watchers.\n\nHomo sapiens\u2019 nose for danger and for delicious foods may have given us an evolutionary advantage over other species. Anthropologists have found that the parts of the human brain associated with olfaction and cognition are 12 percent larger than those of Neanderthals. Researchers speculate this may have allowed H. sapiens to consume a greater variety of foods and better recognize kin, which contributes to group cohesion.\n\nIn their 2021 book, Delicious: The Evolution of Flavor and How It Made Us Human, ecologist Rob Dunn and medical anthropologist Monica Sanchez hypothesize that the ability to sniff complex aromas advanced human evolution because it allowed ancient people to enjoy more complex flavors. When cooked, \u201cmeat goes from having tens of aromas to having hundreds of different aroma compounds,\u201d Dunn told The Guardian. Dunn and Sanchez argue that the desire for aromatic cooked meat may have led early humans to control fire and invent better stone tools for barbecuing.\n\nCooked food is also safer, easier to digest, and provides more calories than raw meat. So, some scientists have suggested that cooked food allowed our ancestors to develop smaller digestive systems and bigger brains. This somewhat controversial idea claims that cooking meat made us human.\n\nThe anthropology of smell and the environment\n\nAs ancient humans spread across the planet, they encountered myriad new stenches and aromas, and their olfactory systems adapted. Hoover and an interdisciplinary group of colleagues found that contemporary humans have more protein variation in their olfactory receptors than other bipedal apes, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. \u201cIt may mean that it gave us a lot more flexibility as a species to adapt to our environments,\u201d she says.\n\nHuman smell receptor genes also vary tremendously across individuals, populations, sexes, and age groups. Scientists believe culture and the environment play a role. \u201cThe expression of the gene alters with experience,\u201d Cobb explains.\n\nThese olfactory cultural differences play out in numerous ways. For the Ongee of the Andaman Islands, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, smell defines the universe and everything in it. They consider odor to be the source of personality and think their spirits reside in the nose. Their calendar is based on the fragrances of flowers that bloom at different times of the year. They name each season after a particular scent and believe it possesses its own distinct \u201caroma-force.\u201d\n\nOther societies have a more ambiguous relationship with smell. Many Western cultures associate foul stenches with social and moral defilement, and this attitude affects behaviors of social inclusion and exclusion. In the U.S., for example, eliminating body odors through deodorants serves as an ideal of self-control. As a result, Euro-Americans have a different tolerance for body odor than their European ancestors.\n\nThis cultural variation partly stems from variations in \u201csmellscapes\u201d between rural and urban locations. Some hunter-gatherers, such as the Jahai people living in the rainforest of the Malay Peninsula, have a better sense of smell than settled peoples\u2014even horticulturalists in the same region.\n\nThe Seri, or Comcaac, in Sonora, Mexico, speak a language infused with many words for smells and olfactory metaphors for emotions. However, as the community underwent urbanization and \u201cdeodorization,\u201d they lost touch with the smells of certain plants and animals, such as vulture meat, green sea turtle, and snails. These radical changes in olfactory stimuli led to a loss of language and medicinal knowledge, according to a study published in Anthropological Linguistics. The researchers suggest that the connection between scent loss and the loss of language diversity brings urgency to studying smellscapes and their cultural significance.\n\nIn addition to changes in smell lexicon, variations in the built environment can also lead to what Hoover calls \u201csensory inequities\u201d\u2014unequal, often racialized, access to healthy sensory environments. Some of these inequities can lead to smell loss.\n\nRisk for olfactory dysfunction increases with social factors such as poverty, race, and education. A primary risk factor is pollution, which tends to be worse in low socioeconomic areas. \u201cPollution-caused olfactory dysfunction is a clear case of a sensory inequity,\u201d Hoover has written, \u201cand must be placed in the context of environmental injustice and health disparity research.\u201d\n\nMuch like COVID-19, anosmia is not evenly distributed across populations, and one study found that racialized minorities and women were at higher risk for COVID-19\u2013caused anosmia. These inequalities are especially concerning given olfaction\u2019s close connection with mental health.\n\nThe anthropology of smell, memory and emotions\n\nHuman olfaction is unique because unlike the other senses, smell is processed in the brain\u2019s limbic area, which is involved in emotion and memory. This arrangement means a person reacts to a smell before they even have a chance to think about it, and smells can have a lasting connection with emotions.\n\nSocial anthropologist Bettina Beer conducted research in the Philippines among the Boholanos, who have a rich smell lexicon. Beer found that memories related to olfactory stimuli that are learned in childhood are particularly resistant to change and play a key role in early socialization and enculturation.\n\n\u201cSmell has extraordinary power,\u201d explains Cobb. \u201cYou smell a smell, and you may think, That\u2019s a perfume. Or, Oh my God, that\u2019s my Aunt Betty\u2019s perfume from 50 years ago. And it takes you right back to what it was like. It\u2019s qualitatively different from other senses. A song might remind you of the place. But a smell takes you there.\u201d\n\nThe reason, Cobb says, is that the memory gets tagged with that smell. But what happens to those memories and emotions when people lose their sense of smell?\n\n\u201cThere is grief. There is sadness,\u201d Vivian says. \u201cI loved the way that my boyfriend smelled, and I couldn\u2019t smell him. \u2026 It was a memory. \u2026 It changed my relationship, my perception of the world, [of] everything, in a negative way.\u201d\n\nEating is especially tragic for Vivian because when people lose their sense of smell, they also lose most of their ability to experience flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you are eating with a memory of what food used to taste like,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou\u2019re consuming a thought process. Oh, this is how this used to smell. You are looking back on life as a memory, and that\u2019s how you have to live your life.\u201d\n\nMarlene, a U.K.\u2013based writer, says losing her sense of smell following a severe head trauma \u201cerased all pleasure from my life. You don\u2019t know where you are because nothing smells right. The people you love don\u2019t smell right.\u201d\n\nLittle is known about how to regain lost smell, although preliminary evidence indicates that smell training\u2014the conscious sniffing of different odors multiple times a day\u2014may help. Still, some people suffer from anosmia permanently, and others take years to recover.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t smell spring or grass for a number of years, and I accepted it,\u201d Marlene says. Then one day she took a walk in a forest, \u201cand suddenly it was as if this big green cotton candy cloud surrounded me, and I could smell grass.\u201d\n\nFor people like Marlene, experiencing scent again is about more than savoring the fragrance of grass or a tree; it\u2019s about regaining an essential piece of their humanity.\n\nNotes:\n\n* To protect their anonymity, first names only are used for the people with anosmia who were interviewed for this article.\n\nSarah Ives teaches anthropology at the City College of San Francisco.

        "Probiotics: Solution to long-COVID or overhyped sales pitch?",
        "\u201cCould THIS twice-daily probiotic supplement filled with gut friendly bacteria help beat Long Covid?\u201d That\u2019s the headline in the Daily Mail earlier this year, one of dozens in the media across the web promoting the miracle of probiotics.\n\nDozens of other news outlets, from Psychology Today to Medical News Today carried the same unfiltered story. Taking a probiotic supplement, they report, could improve COVID recoveries by promoting the \u201cright mix of gut bacteria\u201d to \u201cboost the body\u2019s immune defenses\u201d.\n\nThese are not new claims. Since the COVID crisis commenced more than two years, and based on a few sketchy and inconclusive studies, \u2018natural\u2019 websites have been making claims that probiotic supplements could be the magic bullet to halt or even cure COVID. According to NUTRA Ingredients, which peddles supplements \u201ca probiotic formulation could act as a complementary remedy to slow down the progression of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nIs it too good to be true?\n\nThe answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but with nuance.\n\nThe most recent surge in articles was sparked by a small study out of Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai that suggested \u2018Long Covid\u2019 may be dictated by the microbes in our gut and that probiotics could hold a solution. \u201cThe gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID severity \u2014 possibly via modulating host immune responses,\u201d they claimed.\n\nThis represents another in a line of studies that seem to support the idea that rebalancing the bacteria in our gut may help fight long-term COVID symptoms. In December, for example, researchers at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust presented data claiming to demonstrate that \u201ctwo capsules a day containing a scientifically chosen blend of natural ingredients could help patients suffering from long COVID\u201d.\n\nOncology consultant Prof Robert Thomas was quoted as saying, \u201cSuch a rapid improvement in the majority who had been experiencing symptoms for over eight months was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.\u201d\n\nBut most scientists and researchers are more dubious. Certainly, there is no question that our gut bacteria is linked to our health. Whether tinkering with our gut bacteria using supplements can meaningfully help address COVID, or any disease for that matter, is far more problematic.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nSkepticism\n\nSince COVID first appeared two years, probiotic devotees have been promoting salves and supplements, claiming that they could boost your immunity and ward off the coronavirus. But the curative claims of probiotics has been met with raised eyebrows from the medical and scientific world.\n\nThere is widespread evidence that gut bacteria is linked to our health\u2014it\u2019s just that probiotics have not been shown to improve it as an aid to battling COVID.\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have responded to the COVID claims with skepticism: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that taking probiotics can prevent or treat COVID-19\u201d. They encourage consumers to \u201cbeware of false claims about COVID-19 cures\u201d.\n\nAkiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, was an early voice of caution, challenging probiotics as a COVID-fighting tool. As he told the BBC, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth. In fact, the concept of \u201cboosting\u201d your immune system doesn\u2019t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that many of these claims have no grounding in evidence\u201d. This idea was viewed as a case of \u201cpseudoscientists are peddling trendy products such as kombucha and probiotics\u201d.\n\nIn other words, this idea may be too good to be true for a reason. Such claims during health crises have a long history. During the Spanish flu crisis a century ago, Vick\u2019s VapoRub offered itself as special treatment along with taking laxatives. Crises breed opportunity, and sometimes snake oil salesman. Is that what\u2019s going on here?\n\nDubious claims\n\nCertainly, many of the sites promoting probiotics do their best to make it seem their over-the counter and unregulated probiotic products are medical magic. Take one example claiming to present a \u201cNew breakthrough study in overweight adults on a weight loss program\u201d. It is clear to any objective eye that this is an advertisement with the product taking front and center and minimal information about the alleged supporting study:\n\nOther ads are a little more subtle. Headlines like \u201cShelf-stable or refrigerated: Which probiotic is better for you?\u201d or \u201c5 surprising signs you probably need a probiotic\u201d are designed to convince the reader into thinking there is scientifically useful information to back up the claims.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what you find when you \u201cGo to the breakthrough study results\u201d. Instead, you are transported via hyperlinks to supplements and products along with disclaimers stating, \u201cAny products featured in this article are selected by our editors, who don\u2019t play favorites. If you buy something, we may get a cut of the sale.\u201d\n\nMany promotional websites contain information that is not only scientifically tenuous, but contrary to the latest data. One common example: articles promoting the use of probiotics to counter gut bacteria loss after a course of antibiotics. This is a popular sales pitch but, unfortunately, data such as this study from the Weismann Institute in Israel suggests this is not such a good idea. Immunologist Dr. Eran Elinav explains:\n\nThe evidence for taking probiotics after antibiotics is a little murky and contradictory, but the public perception of many people and some doctors is that this is a good idea, even without substantial medical evidence. Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences. We need to be cautious about recommending this until further knowledge emerges.\n\nTo date, no probiotic has been FDA approved for clinical use, yet supplements flood the market as they remain unregulated in the US and many other countries.. \u201cMarketing of product is often geared directly at consumers without providing direct and consistent proof of effectiveness,\u201d notes the American Gastroenterological Association.\n\nSo how did this latest probiotic craze gain traction?\n\nLet\u2019s review the science.\n\nThe concept of utilizing probiotics as \u201cCOVID cures\u201d appears to have emerged from multiple studies that suggested the cause may lie within our digestive tract. More specifically, the ~100 trillion bacteria and microorganisms within our gut microbiome. They are a key part of our digestive system. Whenever we eat something, it needs to be broken down so that the nutrients can be absorbed and processed by our body. We cannot do this alone. We require assistance from our gut microbes, particularly in the case of complex carbohydrates and fibers. The bacteria in our gut breakdown and ferment these components and release products that can be utilized by our body.\n\nThe gut microbiome has been linked to many chronic illnesses in the past but the actual impact it has is often debated and data can be tenuous at best. Now, a new set of claims that \u201ctaking a capsule of probiotics, which are designed to boost the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, may speed up recovery from the coronavirus\u201d are gaining traction.\n\nThis is further fueled by an initial study from The Chinese University of Hong Kong that reported an increased presence of harmful and pathogenic bacteria in COVID patients with severe/long-term illness. When paired with the depletion of immune-boosting gut bacteria, the reports suggest that the gut microbial changes could directly relate to an increased risk of developing long-COVID. This has led to some concluding that probiotic supplements could be a way to protect against or treat long term complications of COVID-19 by rebalancing such changes in our gut microbes. Prof Siew NG, head of the study, concluded:\n\nThe most surprising findings were that different bacteria patterns were associated with different categories of Long Covid symptoms such as respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, hair loss, etc. Such patterns were characterized by a higher level of \u201cunfriendly\u201d microbes and lower levels of \u201cfriendly\u201d microbes.\n\nIt sounds promising but suggestive news based on incomplete research should always be approached with a considerable caution. First, COVID pathology is complex. It involves a cascade of immune events that can trigger serious consequences in a number of areas of the body. In the words of John Wherry, director of the Penn Medicine Immune Health Institute, \u201cCOVID is deranging the immune system\u201d.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, we should be wary of studies that play into the billion-dollar probiotic industry narrative that untested products hold the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for complex healthcare issue.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic online, \u201cthere is no clear evidence that probiotics are beneficial,\u201d let alone a potential silver bullet to treat COVID.\n\nFor the most part, probiotic supplements have no measurable impact on your gut microbiome diversity and may actually cause harm in some instances. Dr Matthew Ciorba, a gastroenterologist at Washington University in St. Louis, echoes this message, saying, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that people with normal gastrointestinal tracts can benefit from taking probiotics.\u201d\n\nMany supplement suppliers claim their products \u201coptimize your gut.\u201d That\u2019s mumbo jumbo. The average probiotic supplement contains ~2 billion bacteria. That sounds like a lot but when you consider those 2 billion will only account for 0.002% of the 100 trillion microorganisms in your gut, it\u2019s a bit like dropping a salt particle into a gallon of maple syrup and expecting it to taste salty. The impact will be minimal to non-existent in all but a few specific cases of digestive issues.\n\n\u201cEveryone else can save their money, because there\u2019s no evidence that probiotic supplements offer any benefit to already healthy people,\u201d says Prof Jack Gilbert, founder of the American Gut Project.\n\nBeyond the hype\n\nSo why does the hype around a probiotic COVID cure persist? Greed and bad reporting, for the most part.\n\nIt is often generated by cherry picking of data by websites seeking to promote sales of supplements. Many of the probiotic websites are trying to leverage fear generated by COVID to make a sales pitch for other probiotic supplements.\n\nOnce you get past the \u2018miracle COVID cure\u2019 headlines, many articles actually report more sober and less encouraging findings. One article claiming probiotics can treat COVID, for example, included a quote from a researcher in the field: \u201cIt is not that the use of one probiotic will reduce all the problems caused by COVID-19\u201d, with the article going on to state that \u201cthe best case for probiotic therapy has been in the treatment of diarrhea\u201d. Hardly the COVID are touted in the headline!\n\nThe Daily Mail led with the claim that \u201cnow it seems our gut bacteria can also tackle COVID-19\u201d. However, further into the article, the authors of the study are quoted as being much more measured. Professor Andrew Smith (Medical Sciences) offered this measured take on his findings along with a warming about taking probiotics:\n\nThe study excluded those over 60 and did not account for whether volunteers had been vaccinated or not. So, we don\u2019t know if probiotics provide any benefit to those most at risk of severe Covid. And taking probiotics may be inappropriate for those with a weakened immune system because of the potential increased risk of infection from consuming large quantities of live bacteria.\n\nBut probiotics are at least harmless, right?\n\nIf I want to take it as a precaution surely there is no downside to trying it?\n\nUnfortunately, that may not be the case. According to research from\n\nEran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science, taking probiotics in certain scenarios can actually cause harm:\n\nThe probiotics very potently and persistently prevented the original microbiome returning to its original situation. \u2026 This was very surprising and alarming to us. This adverse effect has not been described to date.\n\nSo there is a risk, however minimal, in taking probiotic supplements in the hope of avoiding complications of COVID-19. When you pair that with the lack of tangible evidence of its benefits, there is not much of a case for probiotics as preventative or acute therapy.\n\nIt is very difficult to find any reputable medical professional promoting probiotics as COVID treatments. For the most part, the idea is being pushed forward by supplement pushers, diet promoters or people that will sell you a handy and expensive course to help you \u201coptimize your microbiome\u201d.\n\nProceed with caution when articles claim you can cure disease by changing the bacteria in your gut. Especially when they claim you can start healing yourself with a convenient, over the counter probiotic pill\u2014one that your doctor would never prescribe. It\u2019s a snake oil salesman pushing miracle cures.\n\nSam Moxon has a PhD in tissue engineering and is currently a research fellow in the field of regenerative medicine.

Even in literate societies, poorer and marginalized segments were rarely written about.\n\nIn most archaeological settings, all that remains of our ancestors is the skeleton.\n\nFor some infectious diseases, like syphilis, tuberculosis and leprosy, the location, characteristics and distribution of marks on a skeleton\u2019s bones can serve as distinctive \u201cpathognomonic\u201d indicators of the infection.\n\nMost skeletal signs of disease are non-specific, though, meaning bioarchaeologists today can tell an individual was sick, but not with what disease. Some diseases never affect the skeleton at all, including plague and viral infections like HIV and COVID-19. And diseases that kill quickly don\u2019t have enough time to leave a mark on victims\u2019 bones.\n\nTo uncover evidence of specific diseases beyond obvious bone changes, bioarchaeologists use a variety of methods, often with the help of other specialists, like geneticists or parasitologists. For instance, analyzing soil collected in a grave from around a person\u2019s pelvis can reveal the remains of intestinal parasites, such as tapeworms and round worms. Genetic analyses can also identify the DNA of infectious pathogens still clinging to ancient bones and teeth.\n\nBioarchaeologists can also estimate age at death based on how developed a youngster\u2019s teeth and bones are, or how much an adult\u2019s skeleton has degenerated over its lifespan. Then demographers help us draw age profiles for populations that died in epidemics. Most infectious diseases disproportionately affect those with the weakest immune systems, usually the very young and very old.\n\nFor instance, the Black Death was indiscriminate; 14th-century burial pits contain the typical age distributions found in cemeteries we know were not for Black Death victims. In contrast, the 1918 flu pandemic was unusual in that it hit hardest those with the most robust immune systems, that is, healthy young adults. COVID-19 today is also leaving a recognizable profile of those most likely to die from the disease, targeting older and vulnerable people and particular ethnic groups.\n\nWe can find out what infections were around in the past through our ancestors\u2019 remains, but what does this tell us about the bigger picture of the origin and evolution of infections? Archaeological clues can help researchers reconstruct aspects of socioeconomic organization, environment and technology. And we can study how variations in these risk factors caused diseases to vary across time, in different areas of the world and even among people living in the same societies.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine?

Culture influences biology, too, although it can be hard for our bodies to keep up with rapid cultural changes. For example, in the 20th century, highly processed fast food replaced a more balanced and healthy diet for many. Because the human body evolved and was designed for a different world, this dietary switch resulted in a rise in diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\nFrom a paleoepidemiological perspective, the most significant event in our species\u2019 history was the adoption of farming. Agriculture arose independently in several places around the world beginning around 12,000 years ago.\n\nPrior to this change, people lived as hunter-gatherers, with dogs as their only animal companions. They were very active and had a well balanced, varied diet that was high in protein and fiber and low in calories and fat. These small groups experienced parasites, bacterial infections and injuries while hunting wild animals and occasionally fighting with one another. They also had to deal with dental problems, including extreme wear, plaque and periodontal disease.\n\nOne thing hunter-gatherers didn\u2019t need to worry much about, however, was virulent infectious diseases that could move quickly from person to person throughout a large geographic region. Pathogens like the influenza virus were not able to effectively spread or even be maintained by small, mobile, and socially isolated populations.\n\nThe advent of agriculture resulted in larger, sedentary populations of people living in close proximity. New diseases could flourish in this new environment. The transition to agriculture was characterized by high childhood mortality, in which approximately 30% or more of children died before the age of 5.\n\nAnd for the first time in an evolutionary history spanning millions of years, different species of mammals and birds became intimate neighbors. Once people began to live with newly domesticated animals, they were brought into the life cycle of a new group of diseases \u2013 called zoonoses \u2013 that previously had been limited to wild animals but could now jump into human beings.\n\nAdd to all this the stresses of poor sanitation and a deficient diet, as well as increased connections between distant communities through migration and trade especially between urban communities, and epidemics of infectious disease were able to take hold for the first time.\n\nGlobalization of disease\n\nLater events in human history also resulted in major epidemiological transitions related to disease.\n\nFor more than 10,000 years, the people of Europe, the Middle East and Asia evolved along with particular zoonoses in their local environments. The animals people were in contact with varied from place to place. As people lived alongside particular animal species over long periods of time, a symbiosis could develop \u2013 as well as immune resistance to local zoonoses.\n\nAt the beginning of modern history, people from European empires also began traveling across the globe, taking with them a suite of \u201cOld World\u201d diseases that were devastating for groups who hadn\u2019t evolved alongside them. Indigenous populations in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas had no biological familiarity with these new pathogens. Without immunity, one epidemic after another ravaged these groups. Mortality estimates range between 60-90%.\n\nThe study of disease in skeletons, mummies and other remains of past people has played a critical role in reconstructing the origin and evolution of pandemics, but this work also provides evidence of compassion and care, including medical interventions such as trepanation, dentistry, amputation and prostheses, herbal remedies and surgical instruments.\n\nOther evidence shows that people have often done their best to protect others, as well as themselves, from disease. Perhaps one of the most famous examples is the English village of Eyam, which made a self-sacrificing decision to isolate itself to prevent further spread of a plague from London in 1665.\n\nIn other eras, people with tuberculosis were placed in sanatoria, people with leprosy were admitted to specialized hospitals or segregated on islands or into remote areas, and urban dwellers fled cities when plagues came.\n\nAs the world faces yet another pandemic, the archaeological and historical record are reminders that people have lived with infectious disease for millennia. Pathogens have helped shape civilization, and humans have been resilient in the face of such crises.\n\nCharlotte Roberts is a Professor of Archeology at Durham University.\n\nGabriel D.

        "\u201825 million infants missing vaccines\u2019: COVID disruptions cause plunge in global childhood vaccination rates",
        "T\n\nhe largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years has been recorded in official data published [July 15] by WHO and UNICEF.\n\nThe percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) \u2013 a marker for immunization coverage within and across countries \u2013 fell 5 percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81 per cent.\n\nAs a result, 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP through routine immunization services in 2021 alone. This is 2 million more than those who missed out in 2020 and 6 million more than in 2019, highlighting the growing number of children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases. The decline was due to many factors including an increased number of children living in conflict and fragile settings where immunization access is often challenging, increased misinformation and COVID-19 related issues such as service and supply chain disruptions, resource diversion to response efforts, and containment measures that limited immunization service access and availability.\n\n\u201cThis is a red alert for child health. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,\u201d said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. \u201cWhile a pandemic hangover was expected last year as a result of COVID-19 disruptions and lockdowns, what we are seeing now is a continued decline. COVID-19 is not an excuse. We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems.\u201d\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\n18 million of the 25 million children did not receive a single dose of DTP during the year, the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, with India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Philippines recording the highest numbers. Among countries1 with the largest relative increases in the number of children who did not receive a single vaccine between 2019 and 2021 are Myanmar and Mozambique.\n\nGlobally, over a quarter of the coverage of HPV vaccines that was achieved in 2019 has been lost. This has grave consequences for the health of women and girls, as global coverage of the first dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is only 15%, despite the first vaccines being licensed over 15 years ago.\n\nIt was hoped that 2021 would be a year of recovery during which strained immunization programmes would rebuild and the cohort of children missed in 2020 would be caught-up. Instead, DTP3 coverage was set back to its lowest level since 2008 which, along with declines in coverage for other basic vaccines, pushed the world off-track to meet global goals, including the immunization indicator for the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis historic backsliding in rates of immunization is happening against a backdrop of rapidly rising rates of severe acute malnutrition. A malnourished child already has weakened immunity and missed vaccinations can mean common childhood illnesses quickly become lethal to them. The convergence of a hunger crisis with a growing immunization gap threatens to create the conditions for a child survival crisis.\n\nVaccine coverage dropped in every region, with the East Asia and Pacific region recording the steepest reversal in DTP3 coverage, falling nine percentage points in just two years.\n\n\u201cPlanning and tackling COVID-19 should also go hand-in-hand with vaccinating for killer diseases like measles, pneumonia and diarrhea,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of either/or, it\u2019s possible to do both\u201d.\n\nSome countries notably held off declines. Uganda maintained high levels of coverage in routine immunization programmes, whilst rolling out a targeted COVID-19 vaccination programme to protect priority populations, including health workers. Similarly, Pakistan returned to pre-pandemic levels of coverage thanks to high-level government commitment and significant catch-up immunization efforts. To achieve this in the midst of a pandemic, when healthcare systems and health workers were under significant strain, should be applauded.\n\nMonumental efforts will be required to reach universal levels of coverage and to prevent outbreaks. Inadequate coverage levels have already resulted in avoidable outbreaks of measles and polio in the past 12 months, underscoring the vital role of immunization in keeping children, adolescents, adults, and societies healthy.\n\nFirst dose measles coverage dropped to 81 per cent in 2021, also the lowest level since 2008. This meant 24.7 million children missed their first measles dose in 2021, 5.3 million more than in 2019. A further 14.7 million did not receive their needed second dose. Similarly, compared to 2019, 6.7 million more children missed the third dose of polio vaccine and 3.5 million missed the first dose of the HPV vaccine- which protects girls against cervical cancer later in life.\n\nThe sharp two-year decline follows almost a decade of stalled progress, underscoring the need to not only address pandemic-related disruptions but also systemic immunization challenges to ensure every child and adolescent is reached.\n\nWHO and UNICEF are working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other partners to deliver the global Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), a strategy for all countries and relevant global partners to achieve set goals on preventing diseases through immunization and delivering vaccines to everyone, everywhere, at every age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heart-breaking to see more children losing out on protection from preventable diseases for a second year in a row. The priority of the Alliance must be to help countries to maintain, restore and strengthen routine immunization alongside executing ambitious COVID-19 vaccination plans, not just through vaccines but also tailored structural support for the health systems that will administer them,\u201d said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\nThe IA2030 partners call on governments and relevant actors to:\n\nIntensify efforts for catch-up vaccination to address backsliding on routine immunization, and expand outreach services in underserved areas to reach missed children and implement campaigns to prevent outbreaks;\n\nImplement evidence-based, people-centred, and tailored strategies to build trust in vaccines and immunization, counter misinformation and increase vaccine uptake particularly among vulnerable communities;\n\nEnsure current pandemic preparedness and response and the global health architecture strengthening efforts lead to investment in primary health care (PHC) services, with explicit support to strengthen and sustain essential immunization;\n\nEnsure political commitment from national governments and increase domestic resource allocation to strengthen and sustain immunization within PHC;\n\nPrioritize health information and disease surveillance systems strengthening to provide the data and monitoring needed for programmes to have maximum impact; and\n\nLeverage and increase investment in research to develop and improve new and existing vaccines and immunization services that can achieve community needs and deliver on IA2030 goals.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Of countries with at least 10,000 zero-dose children in 2021\n\nRead the original post here"

        "ADHD Diet: Foods to Try, Foods to Avoid, and Sample Meal Plan",
        "Omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, and an elimination diet are a few options that may be helpful for ADHD. Share on Pinterest Westend61/Getty Images If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), you may already be aware of how helpful the right treatment can be for managing symptoms. Whether that treatment includes medication, therapy, or complementary approaches, it can make a big difference in someone\u2019s quality of life with ADHD. Dietary therapy for ADHD, which involves approaches such as eliminating or adding certain foods to the diet, is often considered a complementary approach to ADHD treatment \u2014 one that is best used in combination with other approaches. And although the research on diet and ADHD is mixed, there are a few interventions that have shown promise.\n\nCan dietary changes help manage ADHD symptoms? A 2020 review article shares findings that children who have ADHD also tend to have lower blood levels of certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, iron, and zinc. In children with these particular deficiencies, supplementation may help reduce ADHD symptoms. In adults with ADHD, certain nutrient deficiencies may also contribute to a worsening of symptoms. One 2016 study found that adults with ADHD tended to have lower levels of certain B vitamins, including B2, B6, and B9. Lower levels of both B2 and B6 were also associated with an increased severity in ADHD symptoms. Another 2019 study showed that children with ADHD not only had lower levels of vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin B6, but also ferritin and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Plus, they had higher levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA), a higher omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio, and higher levels of phosphorus. The researchers share that children with ADHD also tend to eat foods that are higher in sugar and fat, while also eating less nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. Dietary differences like these may explain why children with ADHD are more likely to have lower levels of certain nutrients. Early research suggested that eliminating certain food products, such as foods that contain added sugar and artificial food coloring, may also help reduce ADHD symptoms \u2014 especially in children. Many of the studies on these potentially harmful ingredients found that eliminating them from the diet had a positive effect on ADHD symptoms. However, the research on the subject has evolved since the early 2000s, giving mixed results about diet and ADHD. A 2019 review of 14 studies on a potential link between dietary patterns and ADHD found that diets high in refined sugar and fat may potentially increase ADHD risk, whereas diets high in nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables were potentially protective against ADHD. Still, despite this evidence, the researchers mention that given the low number of studies on the subject \u2014 and potentially poor study designs for some of the studies included \u2014 more research is needed to support this possible link. Another 2020 review of the literature sought to investigate the role of diet in the treatment of ADHD in children. Within the review, only two out of six studies recommended removing artificial food colorings from the diet, while 10 out of 12 studies included recommended following an elimination diet. Results also showed no current recommendations for cutting either sucrose or aspartame from the diet.\n\nFoods that may worsen ADHD symptoms One theory on ADHD and diet is that sugar intake, especially added sugar (like the kind found in candy, chocolate, and other snacks), can make ADHD symptoms in children worse. However, one large 2019 study in over 1,100 children with ADHD found that there was no significant relationship between added sugar intake and ADHD symptoms. Still, the researchers did note that young children with ADHD were more likely to eat foods high in added sugar \u2014 which may explain why sugar intake can sometimes seem to contribute to ADHD symptoms. Another 2022 study , which explored the nutritional intake of 100 children with ADHD, found that children with ADHD were more likely to eat ready-made foods and foods higher in simple sugars, while also eating fewer nutrient-dense foods when compared with children without ADHD. Plus, children with ADHD were more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference \u2014 both of which may contribute to the severity of symptoms. Another common theory is that foods containing food coloring may worsen ADHD symptoms in children, but once again, the literature is mixed. An in-depth 2012 literature review found that many studies on food dye and ADHD had obvious flaws, making it difficult to come to any solid conclusions. Plus, while the research does suggest that food dye can have a small behavioral impact in children, this effect applies to all children, not just those with ADHD.\n\nOther nutritional tips Elimination diets have been suggested as a way to help improve symptoms of ADHD. An elimination diet involves identifying and removing foods that you suspect may be making your symptoms worse \u2014 and then later re-adding them, slowly and systematically, to determine which foods may be triggers. By learning which foods and ingredients are making your ADHD symptoms worse, you can more easily manage your symptoms in the long run. One type of elimination diet, the few-foods diet, seems to be the most effective diet for reducing ADHD symptoms. For example, one 2020 study found that following a short-term few-foods diet under the supervision of a trained professional can significantly reduce symptoms of both ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). However, outside of following an elimination diet, there are no other diets that are currently shown to be effective for reducing ADHD symptoms. If you\u2019re interested in trying an elimination diet to see if it may improve ADHD symptoms, it\u2019s strongly recommended to only do so under the guidance of a trained professional.\n\nSample meal plan If you\u2019re interested in incorporating more ADHD-friendly foods into your diet, here\u2019s what a sample 3-day meal plan may look like: Day 1 Breakfast: smoothie made with unsweetened Greek yogurt, frozen mixed berries, and almond butter\n\nsmoothie made with unsweetened Greek yogurt, frozen mixed berries, and almond butter Lunch: beef cheeseburger with a whole-grain bun and sweet potato fries\n\nbeef cheeseburger with a whole-grain bun and sweet potato fries Dinner: Indian lentil curry with brown Jasmine rice\n\nIndian lentil curry with brown Jasmine rice Snacks: trail mix made with mixed nuts, dried fruit, and dark chocolate (optional) Day 2 Breakfast: unsweetened oatmeal topped with fresh berries, chopped nuts, and chia seeds\n\nunsweetened oatmeal topped with fresh berries, chopped nuts, and chia seeds Lunch: whole-wheat pasta with grilled chicken, saut\u00e9ed spinach, and mushrooms\n\nwhole-wheat pasta with grilled chicken, saut\u00e9ed spinach, and mushrooms Dinner: baked salmon with roasted broccoli and brown rice\n\nbaked salmon with roasted broccoli and brown rice Snacks: cottage cheese, a hard-boiled egg, and whole cherry tomatoes Day 3 Breakfast: yogurt parfait made with Greek yogurt, mixed berries, and chopped nuts\n\nyogurt parfait made with Greek yogurt, mixed berries, and chopped nuts Lunch: leftover baked salmon salad made with your choice of leafy greens, sliced veggies (your choice), and salad dressing\n\nleftover baked salmon salad made with your choice of leafy greens, sliced veggies (your choice), and salad dressing Dinner: beef and red bean chili topped with sour cream (optional)\n\nbeef and red bean chili topped with sour cream (optional) Snacks: mixed granola made with whole-grain granola, pumpkin seeds, and flax seeds"

        "No, COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not Cause Infertility - Not Getting It Might",
        "Despite claims of anti-vaccine activists no different than groups that used to claim vaccines cause autism, COVID-19 vaccines do not impact fecundability\u2014the probability of conception per menstrual cycle\u2014in female or male partners who received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n\nThe prospective study instead indicates that COVID-19 infection among males may temporarily reduce fertility\u2014 an outcome that could be avoidable through vaccination.\n\nLead author Dr. Amelia Wesselink, epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, and colleagues analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fecundability, among female and male participants in the BUSPH-based Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing NIH-funded study that enrolls women trying to conceive, and follows them from preconception through six months after delivery. Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021.\n\nThe researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility.\n\nWhile COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction.\n\n\u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d\n\nThe new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination."

        "'Virtual' Communication During Social Distancing: How We Change When We Know We're Being Seen",
        "Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom.\n\nBut how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them.\n\nPeople are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates.\n\nThroughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication.\n\nCo-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation.\n\nSimilarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task.\n\nThree areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University\n\nResults of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition.\n\nThere were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them.\n\nTo simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior.\n\n\"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\"\n\nThere was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face.\n\nComparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions.\n\n\"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\""

        "Doomscrolling COVID-19 News Takes an Emotional Toll - Here is How to Prevent That",
        "Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling.\n\nIf this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time?\n\nResearch on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt.\n\nThese findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis?\n\nTo find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all.\n\nPeople who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted.\n\nThese findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood.\n\nAlthough we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood.\n\nMaking your social media a more positive place\n\nOur research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does.\n\nSo what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable?\n\nWe found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee/Shutterstock\n\nOne option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020.\n\nBut how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible?\n\nGiven that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive.\n\nBe mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think.\n\nImportantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.\n\nBy Kathryn Buchanan, Lecturer, Psychology Department, University of Essex; Gillian Sandstrom, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychology, University of Essex; Lara Aknin, Distinguished Associate Professor of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, and Shaaba Lotun, PhD candidate, Department of Psychology, University of Essex.

        "How To Spot Coronavirus Fake News",
        "The proliferation of fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic has been labelled a dangerous \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division.\n\nConfusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy.\n\nIf the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way.\n\nSimilarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories.\n\nWhat to look out for\n\nSource. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly.\n\nLogo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website.\n\nBad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions.\n\nPretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this.\n\nOver-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works.\n\nUse fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media.\n\nWho to trust\n\nThe best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles.\n\nEven government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields.\n\nA time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young/EPA\n\nCharlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19.\n\nThe effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nWe can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.\n\nBy Samantha Vanderslott, Postdoctoral Researcher in Social Sciences, University of Oxford.

        "NVX-CoV2373: Here's How The Coronavirus Vaccine Based On A Flu Shot Works",
        "A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.\n\nThe trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.\n\nThis vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?\n\nWhat\u2019s in the mix?\n\nVaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.\n\nAll vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.\n\nWe often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.\n\nBy targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.\n\nHowever, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.\n\nSo instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.\n\nThe spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided\n\nRethinking an influenza vaccine\n\nThe Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.\n\nThe NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).\n\nIn October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.\n\nAn important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.\n\nThis trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial.\n\nAntibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.\n\nThese results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.\n\nSo the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock\n\nThe Australian clinical trial\n\nThe new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nSome volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.\n\nThe trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.\n\nAll groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.\n\nThis design enables researchers to ask four important questions:\n\ncan the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough?\n\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.\n\nAnd we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nWe eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.\n\nBy Kylie Quinn, Vice-Chancellor's Research Fellow, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University and Kirsty Wilson, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, RMIT University.

        "How organ-transplant teams hunt for hidden animal-to-human viruses",
        "More than 100,000 Americans are currently on waitlists for an organ, and 17 people on that list die every day, according to the nonprofit that manages American organ transplants. A supply of reliable organs from pigs could eliminate much of that bottleneck\u2014and the technology seems to be finally arriving.\n\nAfter more than a decade of research, progress on xenotransplants, or animal-to-human transplants, has accelerated sharply over the past year. In January, surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham successfully transplanted pig kidneys into two brain-dead patients. That same month, a team at the University of Maryland transplanted a pig heart into a patient named David Bennett Sr., who suffered from cardiac disease but wasn\u2019t eligible for a typical organ donation. But 40 days after the procedure, Bennett grew sick and died of heart failure.\n\nThose experiments have laid the groundwork for clinical trials, standardized experiments that would open the door to the widespread use of xenotransplanted organs. At the beginning of the summer, surgeons at New York University Langone Transplant Institute transplanted two hearts from specially bred pigs into patients who were brain dead. For three days, they monitored their vital signs, sampled their bodies, and tested them for viruses. At a press conference announcing the findings on July 12, the NYU team estimated that clinical trials might begin sometime between now and 2025.\n\n[Related: The first successful pig heart transplant into a human was a century in the making]\n\nBut before they do, they\u2019ll need to answer questions about protecting patients from swine-specific diseases. Bennett\u2019s new heart turned out to be infected with a type of pig-specific herpesvirus, called porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), that went undetected before his operation. An investigation into the experimental transplant, published earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine, however, found that the virus didn\u2019t actually infect Bennett\u2019s human cells. It\u2019s still unclear what role it played in his death.\n\nIn the NYU trials on brain-dead patients, surgeons didn\u2019t detect any viruses. Yet the experience with Bennett Sr. highlights the scientific and ethical questions that remain in the way of clinical trials for a procedure that involves not just managing human viruses, but those from another species.\n\nInfections during transplants are more common than you\u2019d think.\n\nInfectious diseases are also a major concern in allotransplants, or human-to-human transplants.\n\n\u201cWe have a few hours in which to take the organ and put it in the recipient,\u201d says Jay Fishman, director of transplant infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a leading xenotransplantation researcher. So while transplant teams test the donor for diseases like hepatitis, those results often aren\u2019t available until the operation is done. \u201cEveryday I get emails from around the country saying, this donor had positive blood cultures,\u201d Fishman says, meaning the patient now needs to be treated for a possible infection.\n\nOf particular concern with transplants are diseases that can go dormant in a donor or recipient\u2019s body, including PCMV, chickenpox, and parasitic worms. Because they\u2019re not actively spreading, a donor might not test positive on a PCR test. \u201cYou can live with certain parasites your whole life without knowing it,\u201d says Sapna Mehta, medical director of NYU\u2019s transplant infectious disease service. The only way to spot a latent infection might be to directly test the nerve, muscle, or lymphatic tissue harboring the pathogen.\n\n[Related: Scientists revived light-sensing cells from dead eyes]\n\nWhen transplant patients are treated with powerful immunosuppressant drugs to prevent their immune systems from attacking the new organ, \u201cviruses or parasites can wake up and cause active infection,\u201d says Mehta. Those infections can be catastrophic for someone who\u2019s recovering from a serious organ disease and a major surgery.\n\nBut because organ supplies are so limited, physicians will still work with donations from infected patients. \u201cWe know sometimes that we have hepatitis C-positive [living kidney] donors, and there are recipients who are willing to get those organs because we can treat hepatitis C,\u201d says Anoma Nellore, associate medical director of UAB\u2019s transplant and immunocompromised infectious disease service.\n\nAnimal donors can share viruses, too.\n\nXenotransplantation can reduce some of the uncertainty of infections, while creating other unknowns.\n\nThe pigs that provide the organs are produced by three US-based biotech firms, Revivicor, eGenesis, and Makana Therapeutics. They\u2019re genetically modified to produce cells that are coated in the same proteins and sugars as those of a human, which reduces the risk of rejection or allergic reactions. Just as importantly, however, they\u2019re bred and raised to prevent the transmission of pathogens during transplants.\n\nBefore a surgery, the companies have virtually unlimited time to screen pigs for diseases. \u201cThey receive immunizations, they undergo deworming, and they get surveillance screening,\u201d Mehta says. \u201cSome of those [tests] are performed on blood; some are performed in the stools of the pig; some of them are nose swabs. \u2026 Stool samples are looked at under a microscope for parasites. It\u2019s done right up until the time that an organ is procured.\u201d\n\nXenotransplant teams also have their own layer of precautions. NYU, Mehta says, screens for a number of pig viruses that can lie dormant. In their most recent experiment, they took samples from the pig and recipient before the transplant, and then every 24 hours through the three-day study.\n\nNYU surgeons transplanted pig hearts into two brain-dead patients in June and July of this year. In both cases, they saw no signs of organ rejection. Joe Carotta for NY Langone Health\n\nBut testing technologies and protocols for pig viruses aren\u2019t as well-established as the tests used in allotransplants. And that\u2019s part of what appears to have led to Bennett\u2019s infection. \u201cThe nasal swab was negative [for PCMV],\u201d says Muhammad Mohiuddin, director of UMD\u2019s cardiac xenotransplantation program. \u201cSo based on our experience, we were very sure that there was no PCMV in the pig.\u201d\n\nIn the two months after Bennett\u2019s surgery, however, he began to test positive for the virus, and levels of the pathogen\u2019s genetic material in his blood rose. When the transplant team went back to the pig\u2019s spleen, they found latent PCMV. \u201cThe question now is, what did the latent virus do?\u201d Mohiuddin asks.\n\nAfter Bennett\u2019s death, surgeons found that tissues in his heart had ruptured, and the entire organ had swelled. The symptoms resembled those seen in pig-to-baboon transplant experiments\u2014baboons found to be infected with PCMV lived an average of three weeks less after the operation than virus-free monkeys.\n\nBut Mohiuddin says that he hasn\u2019t even seen indications that the virus was even spreading inside the pig heart. \u201cWe have not seen the actual virus using electron microscopy\u2014usually you\u2019re able to find the virus,\u201d he explains. The fact that the team found PCMV could be a byproduct of unrelated damage to the heart, which could lead the dormant virus to leak into the blood.\n\nFishman agrees. \u201cRemember that this patient was sick. He\u2019d had multiple surgical complications; he\u2019d been on life support for a prolonged period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was not in the physical condition that you would have expected to survive even as long as he did.\u201d\n\nIt could be that the virus was just one trigger in a larger inflammatory process that eventually caused Bennett\u2019s heart to fail\u2014but that uncertainty highlights the scientific value of preventing infections no matter the outcomes. It\u2019s hard to know how well a transplant worked with the extra variable of a virus, which makes it harder to weigh the risk of future experiments.\n\nGoing forward, Mohiuddin says that UMD plans to use an even more sensitive PCR screening for PCMV\u2014though that hasn\u2019t always caught infections in baboon studies\u2014and testing more pig tissues. What\u2019s more, he says, there needs to be a standard in place for treating PCMV infections in people: Antivirals for the disease exist, but the side effects were too intense for Bennett.\n\nThe most appropriate strategy for ensuring that future xenotransplanted organs are safe , both he and Fishman say, is one called a serological assay, which would look for the presence of PCMV antibodies in the donor pig. That test looks at a pig\u2019s immunological past, rather than current infections. If it has antibodies, that means it\u2019s been exposed to the virus, and could be harboring a latent infection.\n\nBoth Mohiuddin and Mehta of NYU say that it\u2019s their understanding that those antibody tests are being developed right now. However, a spokesperson for Revivicor, which grew the pigs used in all this year\u2019s studies, said to Popular Science that the company wouldn\u2019t comment on its approach.\n\n[Related: How animals can help us demystify viruses]\n\nAnother longer-term challenge is that there may be pig diseases that transplant physicians don\u2019t even know to look for. \u201cThe literature about pig viruses tells us for the most part how these viruses behave in pigs who have healthy immune systems,\u201d Mehta says. Some of those may behave very differently in an immunosuppressed human body.\n\nNYU\u2019s approach to that involves scanning for the traces of whole families of pathogens, rather than hunting for just one organism. \u201cYou have the opportunity to do tests that will find whatever\u2019s there,\u201d says Fishman, who has advocated for those wider kinds of screenings.\n\nSo far, NYU says it hasn\u2019t turned up any novel bugs. \u201cOur priorities include preparing for both the known and the unknown,\u201d Mehta says. But for the moment, the known is what\u2019s causing problems.\n\nClinical trials could be the next step in xenotransplantation.\n\nOne of the key lessons from Bennett\u2019s operation, physicians agreed, is the need for a uniform approach to testing. \u201cThere\u2019s no central lab that we can send a sample to,\u201d says Mehta. Right now, each of the four US experiments involves new patients, different tests, and a variety of treatments, making it hard to compare outcomes.\n\nIn spite of those questions, Fishman is optimistic about the field\u2019s readiness to start clinical trials. By stepping up testing or treatment, he says, transplant teams have tools for dealing with known pathogens. And \u201cwithout clinical trials, we\u2019re guessing\u201d at the risks, he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re being careful, but we\u2019re guessing.\u201d\n\nBut the unknowns of possible viruses and infections create an ethical barrier to clinical trials: It\u2019s hard to get informed consent from patients without knowing all the specific risks of a xenotransplant, particularly \u201cbecause you can\u2019t really stop being in [a trial] once it happens,\u201d Nellore says."

        "A short history of US hypersonic weapons testing",
        "The middle of July saw a whopping three successful hypersonic missile tests by the United States\u2014tests of missiles designed to go at least five times the speed of sound. On July 13, DARPA announced the successful test of the Operational Fires (OpFires) missile at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Also on July 13, the Air Force announced a successful test of the booster for the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), used in a flight off the California coast. And on July 18, Raytheon announced the second successful flight test of its Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) hypersonic missile for the Air Force.\n\nWhile the first human-made objects to reach Mach 5 were launched in the 1940s, there has absolutely been a recent uptick in missiles built to go that fast. The other new aspect is that, while in the past hypersonic speeds were a feature of other weapons, today nations such as the United States, China, and Russia are specifically developing weapons to travel at this speed. \u201cHypersonic\u201d has become a category term for the development of very fast and maneuverable weapons.\n\nTo illustrate how we got to this hypersonic moment, below is a timeline of military hypersonic milestones, starting with ballistic rockets.\n\n1944: Hypersonic descent\n\nGerman V-2 rockets reached a speed of Mach 4.3 in ascent, and then became hypersonic in descent, clearing Mach 5 as they struck targets in England. The V-2 was the first long-range ballistic missile. With a range of about 200 miles, it carried a one-ton warhead. It was built using concentration camp labor, a process in which at least 10,000 people in those camps died. It was designed by Wernher von Braun, who would go on after the war to have a long career designing ballistic missiles for the US Army and rockets for NASA.\n\n1949: Hypersonic ascent\n\nA rocket launch called Bumper 5 was the fifth in a series of tests at White Sands. The Bumper series tested a kind of two-stage rocket built by putting one rocket on top of another. The rocket on top for the Bumper tests was a sounding rocket, or a small rocket designed to carry instruments into the upper atmosphere to collect data. For the base and booster, Bumper used a V-2 rocket, which functioned as the first stage, allowing the sounding rocket to reach a speed of Mach 6.7 and an altitude of 250 miles.\n\n1959: Hypersonic weapon deployed\n\nThe Atlas was the first intercontinental ballistic missile fielded by the United States. Its life in service was short, with the missiles recalled from active duty in 1965. Atlas set the template for many ballistic-trajectory hypersonic weapons to follow. With a range of between 6,400 and 9,000 miles, Atlas could arc up into space and then continue its ballistic trajectory back towards Earth, reaching Mach 21 as it did so.\n\nDeveloping Atlas meant designing special heat shielding to ensure that the missile and its thermonuclear payload arrived intact to the target, as the friction and heat from traveling through air at such great speeds could damage the weapon and render it less useful. Today, the US still deploys Minuteman III ICBMs, which are hypersonic missiles like Atlas, but because they travel at detectable ballistic arcs they are not what policymakers or military planners refer to as \u201chypersonic weapons.\u201d\n\n1980: Hypersonic glide maneuvering\n\nMuch of the hypersonics research of the 1960s and 1970s was focused on vehicles that carried people, from the X-15 rocket plane to the proposed and never finished Dyna-Soar space plane. This crewed vehicle research led to the development of \u201clifting body\u201d vehicles, most famously the Space Shuttle, in which the body of the plane would generate lift at hypersonic speeds (as it glided back towards Earth) the way wings work at subsonic speeds.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons development, one of the bigger hypersonic efforts built on this \u201clifting body\u201d research and created the Maneuvering Reentry Vehicle (MaRV). The Air Force tested the Advanced MaRV in 1980, and it demonstrated the ability of a warhead-carrying reentry vehicle to change its flight pattern at high speed, allowing it to hit targets beyond the initial arc of ballistic trajectory. That maneuverability is crucial to the modern field of hypersonics. Advanced MaRVS were mounted on Pershing II missiles, before those missiles were withdrawn from service as part of an arms control treaty between the United States and the USSR in 1987.\n\n1998: Joint hypersonic scramjet test\n\nThe Kholod was an experimental design, Soviet in origin, that ended up being tested by both the United States and the Russian Federation in a project of mutual research. Scramjets take in air at supersonic speeds, then combine it with fuel, ignite the fuel, and express the injected fuel out a back nozzle. To get to supersonic speeds, the Kholod needed to ride on the tip of an anti-air missile. In a 1998 test in Russia with NASA involved, the Kholod reached Mach 6.5.\n\n2010: X-51 WaveRider ushers in modern hypersonics\n\nBuilding on previous scramjet knowledge, the Air Force tested the Boeing-built X-51 Waverider from 2010 to 2013. For these tests, the WaveRider was attached to a cruise missile that was carried aloft by a B-52 bomber. The missile worked as a first stage, with the WaveRider accelerating from there to at least Mach 5.\n\n2011: Too fast for thick skin\n\nIn October 2011, DARPA lost contact with its Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2 nine minutes into flight. A report published in April 2012 concluded that traveling at Mach 20 wore through its protective outer coating, damaging the ability of the vehicle to self-correct in flight.\n\n2014: Advanced hypersonic failure\n\nIn a 2014 test at the Kodiak Island launch facility in Alaska, the Army\u2019s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon failed. Later investigations revealed the flaws to be in the launch vehicle, not the hypersonic weapon itself.\n\nSeptember 2021: HAWC\n\nIn September 2021, DARPA first tested the Raytheon-built version of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, which reached speeds at or exceeding Mach 5. Then again in March 2022, DARPA tested the version of the HAWC built by Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne. In July 2022, Raytheon successfully flew its version of HAWC a second time.\n\nOctober 2021: Glide vehicle\n\nIn October 2021, China demonstrated an object launched partially into orbit that crashed back down at hypersonic speeds. It was most likely a glide vehicle known as a \u201cfractional orbital bombardment system,\u201d a kind of trajectory that can cross the globe without the high arc and sharp descent of a traditional ballistic missile.\n\nMay 2022: ARRW\n\nIn a test off the coast of California, the Air Force launched an Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon. This test checked the bare minimum of boxes for a successful flight: It detached successfully, its engine started, and it reached Mach 5, all feats that previous tests of the ARRW had failed to achieve. In July 2022, the ARRW again hit its mark.\n\nJuly 2022: OpFires\n\nIn testing at White Sands, DARPA successfully deployed and launched an Operational Fires missile from a Marine Corps logistics truck using Army artillery controls. The intent of the program is to have a hypersonic weapon that can be fired from standard available trucks, hitting targets at speed and range that cannot be safely reached by aircraft.\n\nWatch a video of OpFires below:"

        "Accelerated western European heatwave trends linked to more-persistent double jets over Eurasia",
        "Data\n\nTo study jet stream states over Eurasia we used ERA5 reanalysis data60 for the zonal-mean zonal wind (u) over the area 25\u00b0\u221280\u00b0N, focusing on the Eurasian sector (25\u00b0W\u2013180\u00b0E), for the pressure levels 800hPa-100hPa, and for the months July and August. The size of the domain and the pressure levels were tested and the results were found to be insensitive to changes (e.g. 0\u201390\u00b0N, or pressure levels 1000hPa-100hPa). The data are in a 0.28\u00b0 \u00d7 0.28\u00b0 spatial resolution and daily values were calculated from 6-hourly data (in particular from the timesteps 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00). Other variables used and presented in composite maps, such as mean and maximum surface temperature (used to calculate the heatwave metrics, see \u201cHeatwave definition, metrics, and trends\u201d) and zonal (u) and meridional (v) wind at the 250hPa pressure level were also retrieved from the ERA5 datasets.\n\nHeatwave definition, metrics, and trends\n\nAlthough there is no universal definition for heatwaves, there are some criteria and thresholds that have been used and tested extensively in the literature. Main characteristics of a heatwave are the physical one which describes its intensity, referring to the temperature ranges reached, the temporal that refers to its duration, and the spatial, which describes the spatial extent of a heatwave. Here we define a heatwave day based on the following criteria:\n\nTemperature threshold: the daily maximum temperature has to exceed the 90th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution of the period studied based on a centered 15-day window (Tmax >90th percentile), following Fischer and Sch\u00e4r 61 .\n\nTemporal extension: we define heatwaves as at least 3 62 or 6 61 consecutive days of temperature threshold exceedance. In the main manuscript we present the results referring to long heatwaves (\u22656 consecutive days), while results for shorter heatwaves (\u22653 consecutive days) are presented in the SI.\n\nSpatial extent: we define an event as a heatwave if it exceeds an area of 40.000 km2 within a 4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 sliding window (similar to Stefanon et al.63). Different sliding windows were tested and did not have a significant effect on the heatwave detection.\n\nApart from the heatwave frequency we are also interested in the heatwave intensity. Here we look at the heatwave cumulative intensity, as defined by with Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Lewis3, which refers to the integration of heat exceedance over the threshold for each heatwave event. When referring to a whole region, we additionally aggregate the heat exceedance for the whole spatial extent:\n\n$${heatwave}\\,{cumulative}\\,{intensity}={\\sum }_{1}^{{gp}}\\;{\\sum }_{1}^{d}(T{\\max }-{T{\\max }}_{90{th}})$$ (1)\n\nwhere gp is the number of land grid points for each region, d is the number of consecutive heatwave days, Tmax the maximum daily temperature and Tmax 90th the 90th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution of the whole time period 1979\u20132020.\n\nThe heatwave cumulative intensity is a useful metric as it integrates in a single number all the characteristics of a heatwave: intensity, duration and spatial extent. This way it enables easier comparisons between different regions or years. Additionally, considering the excess heat experienced once the heatwave threshold is exceeded makes this metric more impact-relevant3.\n\nIn all cases where heatwave cumulative intensity is aggregated for a certain region, only the land grid points are considered and the data are weighted by the cosine of the latitude to account for the different size of the grid cells between different latitudinal zones.\n\nAll trends reported in this study, such as the trends of the heatwave metrics and those of the double jet frequency and occurrence, are simple linear trends calculated as the slope of the least squares line of each variable against time. Additionally, a LOESS regression smoothing has been applied in the case of the trends of the SOM similarity indices in Fig. 3d, e. For the comparison of distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used.\n\nIdentification of jet stream states\n\nIn order to detect double jet configurations in the vertical zonal-mean zonal wind field, we used a neural network-based, unsupervised clustering algorithm, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM35,64). SOMs have been used a lot in recent decades in atmospheric sciences31,65 and they provide a flexible alternative to other clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering. The SOM algorithm starts with randomly initialized weight vectors (c), followed by a sampling step, during which a random input vector (x) is compared to all weight vectors until its Best Matching Unit (BMU) is detected according to a distance metric (here we use sum of squares). Next, the BMU and its neighboring units are updated to become more similar to the newly added input vector, according to the following function:\n\n$${{{{{{\\bf{c}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{k}}}}}}}\\left(t+1\\right)={{{{{{\\bf{c}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{k}}}}}}}\\left(t\\right)+\\alpha \\left(t\\right)\\times {h}_{{ck}}(t)\\times [x\\left(t\\right)-{{{{{{\\bf{c}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{k}}}}}}}\\left(t\\right)]$$ (2)\n\nwhere c k the BMU weight vector, \u03b1 the learning rate parameter that decreases with each iteration t, and h ck a neighborhood function determining how many neighbor nodes surrounding the BMU will be affected. Here, the bubble type neighborhood function was used:\n\n$${h}_{{ck}}(t)=F(\\sigma (t)-{d}_{{ck}})$$ (3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the neighborhood radius that decreases linearly with iteration (t) until it reaches 0, when no neighbor nodes are updated anymore, d ck the Euclidean distance between the BMU (c) and another one of the SOM nodes (k), and F(x) is a step function that takes the value 1 as long as the neighborhood radius remains larger than the Euclidean distance, and the value 0 when the radius becomes equal to it.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each one of the input vectors (the algorithm goes back to the sampling step) until the final SOM array does not change anymore. The SOM finalization is achieved when all input vectors have been assigned to their BMU. The neighborhood function included in the SOM algorithm is the element that makes this method different from other clustering techniques, such as k-means, as it allows for a topological ordering of the SOM clusters in the final SOM array, which represents the structure of the input data.\n\nOne of the choices that has to be made a priori with SOMs is how many clusters will be employed and this heavily depends on the scope of the study and the application and the degree of generalization that one wants to achieve. For our analysis, we tried different SOM sizes (from 2 to 6, not shown) and found that 3 SOMs represent the different jet stream states that we are interested in to a good degree. More than 3 SOMs produced very similar clusters, while 2 SOMs resulted in too general patterns. Additionally, we tested k-means and hierarchical clustering on the same data and with the same number of clusters (2\u20136) and the results were fairly similar (not shown).\n\nFurthermore, due to the inherent stochasticity of the SOM algorithm, slightly different results may be obtained from different random initializations and therefore multiple random runs are recommended66. Here we use 10 random runs and choose the SOM array that better represents the input data according to the quantization error that measures the goodness of the final SOM in terms of similarity of the SOM clusters to the contained data vectors67:\n\n$${quantization}\\,{error}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum {{{{{\\rm{||}}}}}}{\\vec{{{{{{\\bf{x}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{i}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\\bf{c}}}}}}}_{{\\vec{{{{{{\\bf{x}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{i}}}}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{||}}}}}}$$ (4)\n\nwhere N is the number of data vectors x and c its best matching unit, i.e. the weight vector of the SOM cluster in which it is classified.\n\nApart from testing different numbers of SOM clusters and running 10 random initializations, we performed sensitivity analysis regarding the months used as input for the SOMs, and the spatial domain. Initially, June-July-August (JJA) data were tested, but the results showed that June has a fairly different behavior compared to July and August in terms of the jet stream, being more of a transitional month between spring and summer. This might be related to the fact that the most pronounced thermal gradient over the Arctic circle is seen in high-summer months, due to the largest differences in land versus sea warming25. To test whether the results are robust for an extended warm period, we projected the three SOMs defined in July and August on May, June, and September (Fig. S4). Figure S5 shows the distribution of the three jet stream states among the different months of this extended period. May and June, primarily, and September to a lesser degree, are dominated by the mixed jet stream state. On the other hand, double jets are almost exclusively a July and August feature, as they hardly occur in the other months. Nevertheless, even when taking into account May-September (MJJAS), the composites of mean temperature and heatwave cumulative intensity (Fig. S4j-l and m-o) remain consistent with the ones seen in Fig. 2 for July-August only. Additionally, the significant upward trends in frequency and persistence of double jets (Fig. S4d-f) are also detected in the MJJAS analysis.In addition, although a lengthening of the mean European summer period has been observed68,69 and often early summer heatwaves may have greater impacts on mortality70, most of the severe European heatwaves are taking place in high-summer(July-August)9. For these reasons we decided to focus this analysis on July-August (JA) only, similarly to previous studies71.\n\nFor the spatial domain, we tested both the whole hemisphere and the Eurasian sector only. The results were consistent (not shown), with double jets always showing up in one of the clusters with a similar frequency of occurrence, and therefore we chose to continue the analysis using the jet states over the Eurasian sector, as they are more relevant for heat extremes over Europe.\n\nTherefore, SOMs were applied on the vertical zonal-mean zonal wind values of different pressure levels (from 800hPa up to 100hPa, at levels taken every 100hPa) of the daily ERA5 data of July and August for the period 1979\u20132020. Before applying the clustering algorithm, the zonal wind fields were weighted by the cosine of the latitude to account for the different size of the grid boxes. The three jet stream states obtained by the SOMs are characterized by the composites of the days belonging to each of them, by a total frequency of occurrence for the whole period, and by their annual frequency and persistence. The annual frequency refers to the number of days that were clustered to each of those jet stream states (SOMs) per year and the annual persistence refers to the maximum number of consecutive days clustered to each of them per year.\n\nNext, focusing on the most persistent double jet events, and in particular those with persistence exceeding the 90th percentile, we further clustered the meridional wind at 250hPa (v250) over Eurasia of those events in order to analyze dominant wave patterns. We clustered v250 in two SOMs and applied 10 random runs, choosing the one with the smallest quantization error. In order to check for the existence of trends in the occurrence of the two v250 clusters, we calculated a similarity index among the two v250 composites and the daily fields of v250. Then, the linear trend of those indices were estimated, and additionally, to account for non-linear trends a smoothed LOESS regression curve was applied (using a span of 0.75).All SOM implementations were done in R with the use of the latest version of the \u201ckohonen\u201d package72.\n\nLinks of jet stream states and climate\n\nComposites of different variables were made for the days belonging to each one of the three jet states described above. The composites of the zonal wind at the 250hPa level (u250) and of mean surface temperature were calculated for detrended and deseasonalized data and are presented in terms of anomalies from climatology, which was taken as the mean state of all days of the study period (July and August for 1979\u20132020). For the composites of heatwave cumulative intensity, we detrended the data by removing from each grid point the land mean trend of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (25\u201370\u00b0N). The composites are then presented in terms of relative anomalies (%) compared to climatology.\n\nIn order to assess the links between jet stream states and heatwave metrics, we determined linear regression models to quantify the part of the observed heatwave variability explained by the jet stream in a linear model. To account for biases due to potential trends, we first detrended the regressors (jet state frequency and persistence) and the heatwave metrics (frequency and cumulative intensity).\n\nFurther, we calculated the estimated trends in the heatwave metrics at each grid point based on the linear regression model of the previous step. We used the regression parameters for the models calculated for the detrended data to estimate the heatwave trends using the non-detrended regressor (jet frequency and persistence). This way we can compare the estimated trend to the observed one. For the observed trend, we use the residual trend for each grid point after having subtracted the mean midlatitude-land trend. As a first-order approximation, we assume that the thermodynamical contribution to the increase in heatwaves is approximately similar for different midlatitude regions. The observed residual trend is the one that we can then attribute to other changes, such as dynamical changes in the jet stream and local feedbacks."

        "Brook Jackson False Claims lawsuit against Ventavia COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial",
        "This article about the Brook Jackson lawsuit claiming false payment claims for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nBrook Jackson worked as an operator of three of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials sites for 18 days. Based on what she saw, she brought suit against the operator \u2013 Ventavia, the company that hired clinical trials site operators, ICON PLC., and Pfizer in the name of the United States under the False Claims Act. Jackson\u2019s lawsuit claims, if true, may show that Ventavia had many issues in running the trial.\n\nBut they do not show fraud in relation to claims of payment from the federal government, which is the heart of a False Claims claim, and that alone should probably lead to her lawsuit being dismissed. The False Claims Act is not a catch-all tool for violation of FDA regulations.\n\nAgain, even if true, they do not show a problem with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, a vaccine for which there is now extensive independent data on safety and effectiveness.\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska on Pexels.com\n\nThe Brook Jackson case\n\nFrom the materials in the litigation, Brook Jackson was hired by Ventavia. This company describes itself as \u201ca leading clinical research firm, specializing in trials of pediatric, maternal, and adult vaccines and other medicines,\u201d as a regional director. Jackson worked for Ventavia for 18 days, and then was fired, and unsurprisingly, there are conflicting claims about why she was fired.\n\nJackson, in her complaint, presents herself as immediately noticing serious problems with Ventavia\u2019s management of the clinical trial, and alerting her superiors to those issues. She implies that she was fired because of her efforts to correct such violations. She also suggests that she was fired because she reported the violations to FDA, though there\u2019s no indication that at the time she was fired, the company knew that she did that.\n\nBrook Jackson says, in her complaint:\n\nOn the following morning, Relator called the FDA\u2019s hotline to report the clinical trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns she witnessed. Relator was terminated from her position at Ventavia that same day\u2014September 25, 2020\u2014under the pretext that she was \u201cnot a good fit.\u201d Relator had never been formally disciplined or reported for any failure regarding her job performance.\n\nI think this strongly implies that the call to the FDA was the reason for the termination.\n\nOn the other hand, Ventavia claims that Jackson \u201ccame with an agenda,\u201d violated company policy and patient privacy, and unblinded herself and others from participants in the clinical trials. It concludes: \u201cRelator was fired for violating company policy and patient confidentiality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for causing waves and pointing out real issues. It\u2019s also possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for violating rules and policies and ignoring patient privacy. At this point, I do not know. What is clear is that Ms. Jackson and Ventavia are unfriendly towards each other. That does not, of course, mean that what Ms. Jackson says is not true.\n\nOn January 8, 2021, Ms. Jackson filed her claim under the False Claim Act. I will discuss the act and its requirements below, but in essence, Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint is almost completely a recitation of alleged violations of the trial protocol by Ventavia. Ms. Jackson alleges that Ventavia enrolled subjects that should not have been enrolled, and mentions two types of subjects \u2013 family members of employees, and pregnant women.\n\nShe also alleges that Ventavia was not careful about blinding and engaged in practices that unblinded the participants to trial personnel. She alleges that Ventavia\u2019s recording practices were shoddy and even fraudulent, with changes made inappropriately. She alleges other instances of carelessness, for example in keeping the vaccines at the right temperature or in disposing of materials. If we take Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims as true \u2013 a big if \u2013 the picture we arrive at is of two very sloppily managed trial sites (the two she observed).\n\nSome of the claims also sound like disagreements rather than actual violations \u2013 for example, Ms. Jackson mentioned that patients were put in the hallways and \u201cchecked on\u201d as monitoring, and there seems to have been actual disagreements between Jackson and her superiors on whether that was enough to count as monitoring.\n\nWe should be careful about accepting her claims, of course \u2014 this is a dismissed employee, and Ventavia strongly denies at least some of her claims. For example, Ventavia alleges that the lack of blinding was actually due to the actions of the employee who entered without permission closed-off areas she was not allowed to enter, took pictures of documents that were locked and not to be public with her personal phone, and engaged in other violations that could compromise blinding.\n\nThat does not mean Ms. Jackson was necessarily lying or even wrong \u2014 Ventavia has every interest to blacken her name and may have violated protocols. But it does mean that at this early stage, her allegations need to be approached with care.\n\nWe just do not have enough information at this point to know what is going on with the specific allegations, and both parties should be approached with care. One of the criticisms of a problematic article about the claims Ms. Jackson\u2019s made was accepting her claims at face value, without giving any weight \u2013 indeed, maybe not even soliciting \u2013 responses from the companies she accused.\n\nWhat is clear is that even if Ms. Jackson\u2019s allegations are true, her lawsuit likely cannot meet the legal requirements of a False Claims Act lawsuit, or retaliation under it. Further, even if her allegations are true, the next conclusion she tries to draw from them doesn\u2019t hold. Brook Jackson argues, in her complaint, that:\n\nDue to Defendants\u2019 scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented. The vaccine\u2019s U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) authorization resulted from a deeply flawed clinical trial that violated FDA regulations. Defendants have profited from the COVID-19 pandemic at the expense of the United States and its citizens by abusing the scientific process.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s allegations simply do not support that. Ms. Jackson alleges regulatory violations on two trial sites that cover 1500 people out of over 40,000. Even if her claims could raise issues about safety and effectiveness \u2013 a very big if, and some of the alleged violations (like not properly disposing of needles) are not even related to the clinical trial \u2013 they would apply to a small fraction of trial participants, and by no means negate the results of the trials.\n\nGoing from there to a claim that the authorization was based on a \u201cdeeply flawed clinical trial\u201d is taking a very, very big step that the complaint does not support.\n\nFurther, this is no longer January 2021. We have extensive real-world data about Pfizer\u2019s vaccines from hundreds of millions of doses given in the United States and literally billions around the world, and neither Ventavia nor Pfizer can actually control that data. Even if the complaint gave good grounds to doubt the safety and effectiveness data overall \u2013 and I do not think it does \u2013 it would not show a problem with the authorization or approval given the other data. Trying to use this complaint to argue against authorization and approval generally is simply unconvincing.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nThe False Claims Act and Ms. Jackson\u2019s case\n\nThe False Claims Act goes back to the 19th century, though its current form is much changed from the original act. At its core, it allows a private individual to bring a lawsuit in the name of the United States government against a false claim \u2013 a fraudulent demand for payment \u2013 to the government and allows the private party to collect up to 30% of the payment.\n\nMs. Jackson brought claims under two provisions of the False Claims Act, codified in 31 U.S.C. \u00a73729 (1)(A) and (B). These sections allow claims against anyone who \u2013\n\n(A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; (B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n\nIn essence, she would have to show that the companies (legal people) she\u2019s suing:\n\nThe problem Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims face going in is that it\u2019s not clear she has anything to support the elements of the act. Brook Jackson is suing three companies. Ventavia did not submit any payments to the government, so Ms. Jackson would likely try to use prong (B) \u2013 making a false record in support of a claim for payment.\n\nBut even there, she would have to show that a false claim for payment was submitted to the government, or a false approval or authorization. For Pfizer, she would run into the problem that her complaint nowhere alleges Pfizer submitted a false claim. She claims Pfizer should have \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d of some of the problems she runs into, but she doesn\u2019t actually connect anything Pfizer did to a false claim.\n\nAs pointed out by the motions to dismiss of both Pfizer and Ventavia, the False Claims Act is not there to address general regulatory violations by companies. It is there to address false claims for payment or authorization. In this case, the false claims for payment Ms. Jackson is alleging is that Pfizer got paid for vaccine doses by the United States Department of Defense. But not only did she not show misrepresentation on Pfizer\u2019s part based on the regulatory violations she pointed to, but as Pfizer pointed out, its invoices did not say anything about regulatory compliance: all they were saying was that they are submitting a certain number of doses.\n\nMs. Jackson could try to call this out based on the fact that a condition of the Department of Defense purchasing was FDA authorization or approval. If that was based on fraud, she would allege, that the payment was based on fraud, too. But there are several problems here, too. The less severe one is that not all regulatory violations are also a fraud, but Ms. Jackson is claiming fraud, even if her complaint is scant on details for it.\n\nMore serious is the fact that Ms. Jackson is trying to claim the government was defrauded while, as both Pfizer and Ventavia pointed out, the FDA and the Department of Defense are pretty sure they were not defrauded. First, Ms. Jackson herself sent her claim to both FDA and the Department of Defense, so the government knew of the claims before authorizing \u2013 or paying \u2013 for the vaccines.\n\nThe FDA email was on September 25, 2020, before authorization. The letter to the Department of Defense was from December 14, 2020, before doses were provided to people. If the government knew of the allegations, where is the fraud?\n\nThe essence of fraud is that a party tricked someone else, making them think the reality is not as it is. You cannot trick someone who actually knows the facts. FDA also said openly that it does not think that it was defrauded \u2013 even knowing of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims. In response to her claim, a spokesperson for FDA said:\n\nAlthough the agency cannot comment further at this time in this ongoing matter, FDA has full confidence in the data that were used to support the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorization and the Comirnaty approval.\n\nThe Department of Defense, too, continued to buy Pfizer\u2019s vaccines. This is not surprising: again, even if everything Ms. Jackson\u2019s said was correct, and even if Ventavia has at no point improved its practices, Ventavia handled only 1,500 people out of 43,000 trial participants. And since then, many external studies examined the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. FDA is on solid ground in continuing the authorization and licensing of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u2013 and in line with expert agencies from all around the world.\n\nIf the authorization and licensing is not fraudulent, and the purchase based on it is not fraudulent, where is the false claims act? Again, even if we assume that Brook Jackson showed real regulatory violations, the False Claims Act is not one of the FDA\u2019s enforcement mechanisms. If there\u2019s no fraud against the government, there\u2019s no false claims act.\n\nI could stop here, but I want to address two additional issues:\n\nClaims that were made by Ms. Jackson\u2019s current lawyer about the case. Ms. Jackson\u2019s failure to abide by the seal on the case.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nClaims by the attorney for Brook Jackson\n\nAt some point during the case, Ms. Jackson replaced her initial lawyers from the law firm of Berg and Androphy with attorney Robert Barnes. In a video shared on Rumble by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch, Mr. Barnes claimed that Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss their grounds for dismissal is:\n\n\u2026that it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted fraudulent certifications to the government, it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted false statements under penalty of perjury to the government. It doesn\u2019t matter if they lied about the safety and efficacy of these drugs mislabeled in my opinion as vaccines. Because the government was in with them on it. The government knows what\u2019s going on and the government still has given them the check anyway. Was it really fraud if the government is their co-conspirator? That is in essence Pfizer\u2019s defense to the case.\n\nA few things about this. First, by trying to claim Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is not a vaccine, Mr. Barnes puts himself strongly in the anti-vaccine camp. Second, this is a serious misrepresentation of Pfizer\u2019s position.\n\nHere is Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss. Note that in no place does Pfizer say it committed fraud. In fact, Pfizer says it did not. First, as a technical point, Pfizer points out that their invoices to the Department of Defense did not include \u2013 and were not required to include \u2013 a certification of compliance with the regulations. Pfizer says: \u201cPfizer\u2019s invoices do not contain certifications of compliance with FAR or any other federal regulations. Pfizer instead certified, in a more limited way, that \u201cthe amounts invoiced [were] for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement, the work reflected ha[d] been performed, and prior payment ha[d] not been received.\u201d This certification is a truthful one, and it has nothing to do with the regulatory provisions cited in Relator\u2019s complaint\u201d. The \u201crelator\u201d is the term used for a citizen bringing a false claims act on the government\u2019s behalf.\n\nSecond, Pfizer points out that \u201c[t]he Government has also clearly rejected Relator\u2019s allegations by issuing a recent public statement expressing \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the data supporting authorization and approval of Pfizer\u2019s product.\u201d In other words, far from accepting that Ms. Jackson shows fraud, Pfizer is saying that FDA agrees that Ms. Jackson did not. FDA does not have to accept Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims of problems. And even if they accepted her claims, they do not have to go from regulatory violations to saying that they were frauds. Here, they did not. FDA\u2019s response suggests not that they\u2019re conspiring with Pfizer, but that they do not think that there was a fraud.\n\nThird, Mr. Barnes\u2019 claims are also misleading on the law. The core of the False Claims Act is that the citizen is bringing a claim on behalf of the government to recoup money the government was defrauded of. In fact, 70% of any recouping would go to the government and only 30% to the citizen. If the government claims \u201cwe were not misled\u201d, there is no such fraud. The government is not a co-conspirator in that case; the payment claim was simply not a fraud.\n\nIn essence, Mr. Barnes is misrepresenting Pfizer\u2019s response that \u201cwe did not mislead the government, among other things because the government knows of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims and does not think it paid on a fraud\u201d as saying something very different. Mr. Barnes, as a lawyer suing under the act, should know this.\n\nBreaking of the Seal\n\nClaims brought under the False Claims Act are sealed for at least 60 days to allow the government to decide if to take the claim over, and that period can be extended.\n\nIn this case, the case was filed in January 2021. The government decided not to intervene on January 18, 2022. The case was unsealed on February 10, 2022. But on January 17, 2022, Ms. Jackson Tweeted the complaint\u2019s front page and several claims from it. Even before that, in November 2021 the BMJ published an article by a free-lance journalist based on the claims of the complaint. As part of its motion to dismiss, Ventavia pointed to this violation of the seal requirement, and to cases showing dismissal of claims because of similar violations of seal.\n\nSimilarly, Pfizer requested staying even partial discovery in part because it pointed out that Brook Jackson cannot be relied upon to respect the confidentiality of documents, even if she promises to do so, based on this.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it had taken over a year \u2013 not sixty days \u2013 for the government to respond and say they will not intervene in the case. That\u2019s a long time to keep a complaint under seal, and it seems tricky to force litigants to wait.\n\nOn the other hand, false claim act claims are not usual claims. They are mechanisms for citizens to bring claims against the government, and the claim really is in the name of the government. Brook Jackson did not bring a personal wrongful dismissal claim (though she did include a retaliation claim against Ventavia), she is bringing a claim for false payment to the government. And when she\u2019s doing that, she should respect the rules of the game \u2013 and yes, it does raise questions, since she ignored the sealing requirements here, whether she will respect any confidentiality requirements going forward.\n\nSo what now?\n\nBefore the court now are the complaints and the motion to dismiss. The court set a schedule for hearing them. The court partly \u201cgranted\u201d Pfizer\u2019s request to stay discovery but I\u2019m not quite sure what it means. The court referred to an earlier order that did allow limited discovery as needed for the motions to dismiss.\n\nAlthough the court did set trial dates, that does not mean they will happen \u2013 the next step really is litigating the motion to dismiss. In my view, Ms. Jackson\u2019s claim is highly problematic and very likely to be dismissed, but it will be months before it is resolved. In the meantime, it can be misused to generate an anti-vaccine talking point. I hope this post can help with that.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "Brook Jackson False Claims lawsuit against Ventavia COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial",
        "This article about the Brook Jackson lawsuit claiming false payment claims for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nBrook Jackson worked as an operator of three of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials sites for 18 days. Based on what she saw, she brought suit against the operator \u2013 Ventavia, the company that hired clinical trials site operators, ICON PLC., and Pfizer in the name of the United States under the False Claims Act. Jackson\u2019s lawsuit claims, if true, may show that Ventavia had many issues in running the trial.\n\nBut they do not show fraud in relation to claims of payment from the federal government, which is the heart of a False Claims claim, and that alone should probably lead to her lawsuit being dismissed. The False Claims Act is not a catch-all tool for violation of FDA regulations.\n\nAgain, even if true, they do not show a problem with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, a vaccine for which there is now extensive independent data on safety and effectiveness.\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska on Pexels.com\n\nThe Brook Jackson case\n\nFrom the materials in the litigation, Brook Jackson was hired by Ventavia. This company describes itself as \u201ca leading clinical research firm, specializing in trials of pediatric, maternal, and adult vaccines and other medicines,\u201d as a regional director. Jackson worked for Ventavia for 18 days, and then was fired, and unsurprisingly, there are conflicting claims about why she was fired.\n\nJackson, in her complaint, presents herself as immediately noticing serious problems with Ventavia\u2019s management of the clinical trial, and alerting her superiors to those issues. She implies that she was fired because of her efforts to correct such violations. She also suggests that she was fired because she reported the violations to FDA, though there\u2019s no indication that at the time she was fired, the company knew that she did that.\n\nBrook Jackson says, in her complaint:\n\nOn the following morning, Relator called the FDA\u2019s hotline to report the clinical trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns she witnessed. Relator was terminated from her position at Ventavia that same day\u2014September 25, 2020\u2014under the pretext that she was \u201cnot a good fit.\u201d Relator had never been formally disciplined or reported for any failure regarding her job performance.\n\nI think this strongly implies that the call to the FDA was the reason for the termination.\n\nOn the other hand, Ventavia claims that Jackson \u201ccame with an agenda,\u201d violated company policy and patient privacy, and unblinded herself and others from participants in the clinical trials. It concludes: \u201cRelator was fired for violating company policy and patient confidentiality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for causing waves and pointing out real issues. It\u2019s also possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for violating rules and policies and ignoring patient privacy. At this point, I do not know. What is clear is that Ms. Jackson and Ventavia are unfriendly towards each other. That does not, of course, mean that what Ms. Jackson says is not true.\n\nOn January 8, 2021, Ms. Jackson filed her claim under the False Claim Act. I will discuss the act and its requirements below, but in essence, Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint is almost completely a recitation of alleged violations of the trial protocol by Ventavia. Ms. Jackson alleges that Ventavia enrolled subjects that should not have been enrolled, and mentions two types of subjects \u2013 family members of employees, and pregnant women.\n\nShe also alleges that Ventavia was not careful about blinding and engaged in practices that unblinded the participants to trial personnel. She alleges that Ventavia\u2019s recording practices were shoddy and even fraudulent, with changes made inappropriately. She alleges other instances of carelessness, for example in keeping the vaccines at the right temperature or in disposing of materials. If we take Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims as true \u2013 a big if \u2013 the picture we arrive at is of two very sloppily managed trial sites (the two she observed).\n\nSome of the claims also sound like disagreements rather than actual violations \u2013 for example, Ms. Jackson mentioned that patients were put in the hallways and \u201cchecked on\u201d as monitoring, and there seems to have been actual disagreements between Jackson and her superiors on whether that was enough to count as monitoring.\n\nWe should be careful about accepting her claims, of course \u2014 this is a dismissed employee, and Ventavia strongly denies at least some of her claims. For example, Ventavia alleges that the lack of blinding was actually due to the actions of the employee who entered without permission closed-off areas she was not allowed to enter, took pictures of documents that were locked and not to be public with her personal phone, and engaged in other violations that could compromise blinding.\n\nThat does not mean Ms. Jackson was necessarily lying or even wrong \u2014 Ventavia has every interest to blacken her name and may have violated protocols. But it does mean that at this early stage, her allegations need to be approached with care.\n\nWe just do not have enough information at this point to know what is going on with the specific allegations, and both parties should be approached with care. One of the criticisms of a problematic article about the claims Ms. Jackson\u2019s made was accepting her claims at face value, without giving any weight \u2013 indeed, maybe not even soliciting \u2013 responses from the companies she accused.\n\nWhat is clear is that even if Ms. Jackson\u2019s allegations are true, her lawsuit likely cannot meet the legal requirements of a False Claims Act lawsuit, or retaliation under it. Further, even if her allegations are true, the next conclusion she tries to draw from them doesn\u2019t hold. Brook Jackson argues, in her complaint, that:\n\nDue to Defendants\u2019 scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented. The vaccine\u2019s U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) authorization resulted from a deeply flawed clinical trial that violated FDA regulations. Defendants have profited from the COVID-19 pandemic at the expense of the United States and its citizens by abusing the scientific process.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s allegations simply do not support that. Ms. Jackson alleges regulatory violations on two trial sites that cover 1500 people out of over 40,000. Even if her claims could raise issues about safety and effectiveness \u2013 a very big if, and some of the alleged violations (like not properly disposing of needles) are not even related to the clinical trial \u2013 they would apply to a small fraction of trial participants, and by no means negate the results of the trials.\n\nGoing from there to a claim that the authorization was based on a \u201cdeeply flawed clinical trial\u201d is taking a very, very big step that the complaint does not support.\n\nFurther, this is no longer January 2021. We have extensive real-world data about Pfizer\u2019s vaccines from hundreds of millions of doses given in the United States and literally billions around the world, and neither Ventavia nor Pfizer can actually control that data. Even if the complaint gave good grounds to doubt the safety and effectiveness data overall \u2013 and I do not think it does \u2013 it would not show a problem with the authorization or approval given the other data. Trying to use this complaint to argue against authorization and approval generally is simply unconvincing.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nThe False Claims Act and Ms. Jackson\u2019s case\n\nThe False Claims Act goes back to the 19th century, though its current form is much changed from the original act. At its core, it allows a private individual to bring a lawsuit in the name of the United States government against a false claim \u2013 a fraudulent demand for payment \u2013 to the government and allows the private party to collect up to 30% of the payment.\n\nMs. Jackson brought claims under two provisions of the False Claims Act, codified in 31 U.S.C. \u00a73729 (1)(A) and (B). These sections allow claims against anyone who \u2013\n\n(A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; (B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n\nIn essence, she would have to show that the companies (legal people) she\u2019s suing:\n\nThe problem Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims face going in is that it\u2019s not clear she has anything to support the elements of the act. Brook Jackson is suing three companies. Ventavia did not submit any payments to the government, so Ms. Jackson would likely try to use prong (B) \u2013 making a false record in support of a claim for payment.\n\nBut even there, she would have to show that a false claim for payment was submitted to the government, or a false approval or authorization. For Pfizer, she would run into the problem that her complaint nowhere alleges Pfizer submitted a false claim. She claims Pfizer should have \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d of some of the problems she runs into, but she doesn\u2019t actually connect anything Pfizer did to a false claim.\n\nAs pointed out by the motions to dismiss of both Pfizer and Ventavia, the False Claims Act is not there to address general regulatory violations by companies. It is there to address false claims for payment or authorization. In this case, the false claims for payment Ms. Jackson is alleging is that Pfizer got paid for vaccine doses by the United States Department of Defense. But not only did she not show misrepresentation on Pfizer\u2019s part based on the regulatory violations she pointed to, but as Pfizer pointed out, its invoices did not say anything about regulatory compliance: all they were saying was that they are submitting a certain number of doses.\n\nMs. Jackson could try to call this out based on the fact that a condition of the Department of Defense purchasing was FDA authorization or approval. If that was based on fraud, she would allege, that the payment was based on fraud, too. But there are several problems here, too. The less severe one is that not all regulatory violations are also a fraud, but Ms. Jackson is claiming fraud, even if her complaint is scant on details for it.\n\nMore serious is the fact that Ms. Jackson is trying to claim the government was defrauded while, as both Pfizer and Ventavia pointed out, the FDA and the Department of Defense are pretty sure they were not defrauded. First, Ms. Jackson herself sent her claim to both FDA and the Department of Defense, so the government knew of the claims before authorizing \u2013 or paying \u2013 for the vaccines.\n\nThe FDA email was on September 25, 2020, before authorization. The letter to the Department of Defense was from December 14, 2020, before doses were provided to people. If the government knew of the allegations, where is the fraud?\n\nThe essence of fraud is that a party tricked someone else, making them think the reality is not as it is. You cannot trick someone who actually knows the facts. FDA also said openly that it does not think that it was defrauded \u2013 even knowing of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims. In response to her claim, a spokesperson for FDA said:\n\nAlthough the agency cannot comment further at this time in this ongoing matter, FDA has full confidence in the data that were used to support the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorization and the Comirnaty approval.\n\nThe Department of Defense, too, continued to buy Pfizer\u2019s vaccines. This is not surprising: again, even if everything Ms. Jackson\u2019s said was correct, and even if Ventavia has at no point improved its practices, Ventavia handled only 1,500 people out of 43,000 trial participants. And since then, many external studies examined the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. FDA is on solid ground in continuing the authorization and licensing of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u2013 and in line with expert agencies from all around the world.\n\nIf the authorization and licensing is not fraudulent, and the purchase based on it is not fraudulent, where is the false claims act? Again, even if we assume that Brook Jackson showed real regulatory violations, the False Claims Act is not one of the FDA\u2019s enforcement mechanisms. If there\u2019s no fraud against the government, there\u2019s no false claims act.\n\nI could stop here, but I want to address two additional issues:\n\nClaims that were made by Ms. Jackson\u2019s current lawyer about the case. Ms. Jackson\u2019s failure to abide by the seal on the case.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nClaims by the attorney for Brook Jackson\n\nAt some point during the case, Ms. Jackson replaced her initial lawyers from the law firm of Berg and Androphy with attorney Robert Barnes. In a video shared on Rumble by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch, Mr. Barnes claimed that Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss their grounds for dismissal is:\n\n\u2026that it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted fraudulent certifications to the government, it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted false statements under penalty of perjury to the government. It doesn\u2019t matter if they lied about the safety and efficacy of these drugs mislabeled in my opinion as vaccines. Because the government was in with them on it.

Here, they did not. FDA\u2019s response suggests not that they\u2019re conspiring with Pfizer, but that they do not think that there was a fraud.\n\nThird, Mr. Barnes\u2019 claims are also misleading on the law.

The False Claims Act is not a catch-all tool for violation of FDA regulations.\n\nAgain, even if true, they do not show a problem with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, a vaccine for which there is now extensive independent data on safety and effectiveness.\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska on Pexels.com\n\nThe Brook Jackson case\n\nFrom the materials in the litigation, Brook Jackson was hired by Ventavia. This company describes itself as \u201ca leading clinical research firm, specializing in trials of pediatric, maternal, and adult vaccines and other medicines,\u201d as a regional director. Jackson worked for Ventavia for 18 days, and then was fired, and unsurprisingly, there are conflicting claims about why she was fired.\n\nJackson, in her complaint, presents herself as immediately noticing serious problems with Ventavia\u2019s management of the clinical trial, and alerting her superiors to those issues. She implies that she was fired because of her efforts to correct such violations. She also suggests that she was fired because she reported the violations to FDA, though there\u2019s no indication that at the time she was fired, the company knew that she did that.\n\nBrook Jackson says, in her complaint:\n\nOn the following morning, Relator called the FDA\u2019s hotline to report the clinical trial protocol violations and patient safety concerns she witnessed. Relator was terminated from her position at Ventavia that same day\u2014September 25, 2020\u2014under the pretext that she was \u201cnot a good fit.\u201d Relator had never been formally disciplined or reported for any failure regarding her job performance.\n\nI think this strongly implies that the call to the FDA was the reason for the termination.\n\nOn the other hand, Ventavia claims that Jackson \u201ccame with an agenda,\u201d violated company policy and patient privacy, and unblinded herself and others from participants in the clinical trials. It concludes: \u201cRelator was fired for violating company policy and patient confidentiality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for causing waves and pointing out real issues. It\u2019s also possible that the company fired Ms. Jackson for violating rules and policies and ignoring patient privacy. At this point, I do not know. What is clear is that Ms. Jackson and Ventavia are unfriendly towards each other. That does not, of course, mean that what Ms. Jackson says is not true.\n\nOn January 8, 2021, Ms. Jackson filed her claim under the False Claim Act. I will discuss the act and its requirements below, but in essence, Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint is almost completely a recitation of alleged violations of the trial protocol by Ventavia. Ms. Jackson alleges that Ventavia enrolled subjects that should not have been enrolled, and mentions two types of subjects \u2013 family members of employees, and pregnant women.\n\nShe also alleges that Ventavia was not careful about blinding and engaged in practices that unblinded the participants to trial personnel. She alleges that Ventavia\u2019s recording practices were shoddy and even fraudulent, with changes made inappropriately. She alleges other instances of carelessness, for example in keeping the vaccines at the right temperature or in disposing of materials. If we take Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims as true \u2013 a big if \u2013 the picture we arrive at is of two very sloppily managed trial sites (the two she observed).\n\nSome of the claims also sound like disagreements rather than actual violations \u2013 for example, Ms. Jackson mentioned that patients were put in the hallways and \u201cchecked on\u201d as monitoring, and there seems to have been actual disagreements between Jackson and her superiors on whether that was enough to count as monitoring.\n\nWe should be careful about accepting her claims, of course \u2014 this is a dismissed employee, and Ventavia strongly denies at least some of her claims. For example, Ventavia alleges that the lack of blinding was actually due to the actions of the employee who entered without permission closed-off areas she was not allowed to enter, took pictures of documents that were locked and not to be public with her personal phone, and engaged in other violations that could compromise blinding.\n\nThat does not mean Ms. Jackson was necessarily lying or even wrong \u2014 Ventavia has every interest to blacken her name and may have violated protocols. But it does mean that at this early stage, her allegations need to be approached with care.\n\nWe just do not have enough information at this point to know what is going on with the specific allegations, and both parties should be approached with care. One of the criticisms of a problematic article about the claims Ms. Jackson\u2019s made was accepting her claims at face value, without giving any weight \u2013 indeed, maybe not even soliciting \u2013 responses from the companies she accused.\n\nWhat is clear is that even if Ms. Jackson\u2019s allegations are true, her lawsuit likely cannot meet the legal requirements of a False Claims Act lawsuit, or retaliation under it. Further, even if her allegations are true, the next conclusion she tries to draw from them doesn\u2019t hold. Brook Jackson argues, in her complaint, that:\n\nDue to Defendants\u2019 scheme, millions of Americans have received a misbranded vaccination which is potentially not as effective as represented. The vaccine\u2019s U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) authorization resulted from a deeply flawed clinical trial that violated FDA regulations. Defendants have profited from the COVID-19 pandemic at the expense of the United States and its citizens by abusing the scientific process.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s allegations simply do not support that. Ms. Jackson alleges regulatory violations on two trial sites that cover 1500 people out of over 40,000. Even if her claims could raise issues about safety and effectiveness \u2013 a very big if, and some of the alleged violations (like not properly disposing of needles) are not even related to the clinical trial \u2013 they would apply to a small fraction of trial participants, and by no means negate the results of the trials.\n\nGoing from there to a claim that the authorization was based on a \u201cdeeply flawed clinical trial\u201d is taking a very, very big step that the complaint does not support.\n\nFurther, this is no longer January 2021. We have extensive real-world data about Pfizer\u2019s vaccines from hundreds of millions of doses given in the United States and literally billions around the world, and neither Ventavia nor Pfizer can actually control that data. Even if the complaint gave good grounds to doubt the safety and effectiveness data overall \u2013 and I do not think it does \u2013 it would not show a problem with the authorization or approval given the other data. Trying to use this complaint to argue against authorization and approval generally is simply unconvincing.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nThe False Claims Act and Ms. Jackson\u2019s case\n\nThe False Claims Act goes back to the 19th century, though its current form is much changed from the original act. At its core, it allows a private individual to bring a lawsuit in the name of the United States government against a false claim \u2013 a fraudulent demand for payment \u2013 to the government and allows the private party to collect up to 30% of the payment.\n\nMs. Jackson brought claims under two provisions of the False Claims Act, codified in 31 U.S.C. \u00a73729 (1)(A) and (B). These sections allow claims against anyone who \u2013\n\n(A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; (B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n\nIn essence, she would have to show that the companies (legal people) she\u2019s suing:\n\nThe problem Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims face going in is that it\u2019s not clear she has anything to support the elements of the act. Brook Jackson is suing three companies. Ventavia did not submit any payments to the government, so Ms. Jackson would likely try to use prong (B) \u2013 making a false record in support of a claim for payment.\n\nBut even there, she would have to show that a false claim for payment was submitted to the government, or a false approval or authorization. For Pfizer, she would run into the problem that her complaint nowhere alleges Pfizer submitted a false claim. She claims Pfizer should have \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d of some of the problems she runs into, but she doesn\u2019t actually connect anything Pfizer did to a false claim.\n\nAs pointed out by the motions to dismiss of both Pfizer and Ventavia, the False Claims Act is not there to address general regulatory violations by companies. It is there to address false claims for payment or authorization. In this case, the false claims for payment Ms. Jackson is alleging is that Pfizer got paid for vaccine doses by the United States Department of Defense. But not only did she not show misrepresentation on Pfizer\u2019s part based on the regulatory violations she pointed to, but as Pfizer pointed out, its invoices did not say anything about regulatory compliance: all they were saying was that they are submitting a certain number of doses.\n\nMs. Jackson could try to call this out based on the fact that a condition of the Department of Defense purchasing was FDA authorization or approval. If that was based on fraud, she would allege, that the payment was based on fraud, too. But there are several problems here, too. The less severe one is that not all regulatory violations are also a fraud, but Ms. Jackson is claiming fraud, even if her complaint is scant on details for it.\n\nMore serious is the fact that Ms. Jackson is trying to claim the government was defrauded while, as both Pfizer and Ventavia pointed out, the FDA and the Department of Defense are pretty sure they were not defrauded. First, Ms. Jackson herself sent her claim to both FDA and the Department of Defense, so the government knew of the claims before authorizing \u2013 or paying \u2013 for the vaccines.\n\nThe FDA email was on September 25, 2020, before authorization. The letter to the Department of Defense was from December 14, 2020, before doses were provided to people. If the government knew of the allegations, where is the fraud?\n\nThe essence of fraud is that a party tricked someone else, making them think the reality is not as it is. You cannot trick someone who actually knows the facts. FDA also said openly that it does not think that it was defrauded \u2013 even knowing of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims. In response to her claim, a spokesperson for FDA said:\n\nAlthough the agency cannot comment further at this time in this ongoing matter, FDA has full confidence in the data that were used to support the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorization and the Comirnaty approval.\n\nThe Department of Defense, too, continued to buy Pfizer\u2019s vaccines. This is not surprising: again, even if everything Ms. Jackson\u2019s said was correct, and even if Ventavia has at no point improved its practices, Ventavia handled only 1,500 people out of 43,000 trial participants. And since then, many external studies examined the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. FDA is on solid ground in continuing the authorization and licensing of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u2013 and in line with expert agencies from all around the world.\n\nIf the authorization and licensing is not fraudulent, and the purchase based on it is not fraudulent, where is the false claims act? Again, even if we assume that Brook Jackson showed real regulatory violations, the False Claims Act is not one of the FDA\u2019s enforcement mechanisms. If there\u2019s no fraud against the government, there\u2019s no false claims act.\n\nI could stop here, but I want to address two additional issues:\n\nClaims that were made by Ms. Jackson\u2019s current lawyer about the case. Ms. Jackson\u2019s failure to abide by the seal on the case.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nClaims by the attorney for Brook Jackson\n\nAt some point during the case, Ms. Jackson replaced her initial lawyers from the law firm of Berg and Androphy with attorney Robert Barnes. In a video shared on Rumble by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch, Mr. Barnes claimed that Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss their grounds for dismissal is:\n\n\u2026that it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted fraudulent certifications to the government, it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted false statements under penalty of perjury to the government. It doesn\u2019t matter if they lied about the safety and efficacy of these drugs mislabeled in my opinion as vaccines. Because the government was in with them on it. The government knows what\u2019s going on and the government still has given them the check anyway. Was it really fraud if the government is their co-conspirator? That is in essence Pfizer\u2019s defense to the case.\n\nA few things about this. First, by trying to claim Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is not a vaccine, Mr. Barnes puts himself strongly in the anti-vaccine camp. Second, this is a serious misrepresentation of Pfizer\u2019s position.\n\nHere is Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss. Note that in no place does Pfizer say it committed fraud. In fact, Pfizer says it did not. First, as a technical point, Pfizer points out that their invoices to the Department of Defense did not include \u2013 and were not required to include \u2013 a certification of compliance with the regulations. Pfizer says: \u201cPfizer\u2019s invoices do not contain certifications of compliance with FAR or any other federal regulations. Pfizer instead certified, in a more limited way, that \u201cthe amounts invoiced [were] for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement, the work reflected ha[d] been performed, and prior payment ha[d] not been received.\u201d This certification is a truthful one, and it has nothing to do with the regulatory provisions cited in Relator\u2019s complaint\u201d. The \u201crelator\u201d is the term used for a citizen bringing a false claims act on the government\u2019s behalf.\n\nSecond, Pfizer points out that \u201c[t]he Government has also clearly rejected Relator\u2019s allegations by issuing a recent public statement expressing \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the data supporting authorization and approval of Pfizer\u2019s product.\u201d In other words, far from accepting that Ms. Jackson shows fraud, Pfizer is saying that FDA agrees that Ms. Jackson did not. FDA does not have to accept Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims of problems. And even if they accepted her claims, they do not have to go from regulatory violations to saying that they were frauds. Here, they did not. FDA\u2019s response suggests not that they\u2019re conspiring with Pfizer, but that they do not think that there was a fraud.\n\nThird, Mr. Barnes\u2019 claims are also misleading on the law. The core of the False Claims Act is that the citizen is bringing a claim on behalf of the government to recoup money the government was defrauded of. In fact, 70% of any recouping would go to the government and only 30% to the citizen. If the government claims \u201cwe were not misled\u201d, there is no such fraud. The government is not a co-conspirator in that case; the payment claim was simply not a fraud.\n\nIn essence, Mr. Barnes is misrepresenting Pfizer\u2019s response that \u201cwe did not mislead the government, among other things because the government knows of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims and does not think it paid on a fraud\u201d as saying something very different. Mr. Barnes, as a lawyer suing under the act, should know this.\n\nBreaking of the Seal\n\nClaims brought under the False Claims Act are sealed for at least 60 days to allow the government to decide if to take the claim over, and that period can be extended.\n\nIn this case, the case was filed in January 2021. The government decided not to intervene on January 18, 2022. The case was unsealed on February 10, 2022. But on January 17, 2022, Ms. Jackson Tweeted the complaint\u2019s front page and several claims from it. Even before that, in November 2021 the BMJ published an article by a free-lance journalist based on the claims of the complaint. As part of its motion to dismiss, Ventavia pointed to this violation of the seal requirement, and to cases showing dismissal of claims because of similar violations of seal.\n\nSimilarly, Pfizer requested staying even partial discovery in part because it pointed out that Brook Jackson cannot be relied upon to respect the confidentiality of documents, even if she promises to do so, based on this.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it had taken over a year \u2013 not sixty days \u2013 for the government to respond and say they will not intervene in the case. That\u2019s a long time to keep a complaint under seal, and it seems tricky to force litigants to wait.\n\nOn the other hand, false claim act claims are not usual claims. They are mechanisms for citizens to bring claims against the government, and the claim really is in the name of the government. Brook Jackson did not bring a personal wrongful dismissal claim (though she did include a retaliation claim against Ventavia), she is bringing a claim for false payment to the government. And when she\u2019s doing that, she should respect the rules of the game \u2013 and yes, it does raise questions, since she ignored the sealing requirements here, whether she will respect any confidentiality requirements going forward.\n\nSo what now?\n\nBefore the court now are the complaints and the motion to dismiss. The court set a schedule for hearing them. The court partly \u201cgranted\u201d Pfizer\u2019s request to stay discovery but I\u2019m not quite sure what it means. The court referred to an earlier order that did allow limited discovery as needed for the motions to dismiss.\n\nAlthough the court did set trial dates, that does not mean they will happen \u2013 the next step really is litigating the motion to dismiss. In my view, Ms. Jackson\u2019s claim is highly problematic and very likely to be dismissed, but it will be months before it is resolved. In the meantime, it can be misused to generate an anti-vaccine talking point. I hope this post can help with that.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "Brook Jackson False Claims lawsuit against Ventavia COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial",
        "This article about the Brook Jackson lawsuit claiming false payment claims for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nBrook Jackson worked as an operator of three of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials sites for 18 days. Based on what she saw, she brought suit against the operator \u2013 Ventavia, the company that hired clinical trials site operators, ICON PLC., and Pfizer in the name of the United States under the False Claims Act.

If there\u2019s no fraud against the government, there\u2019s no false claims act.\n\nI could stop here, but I want to address two additional issues:\n\nClaims that were made by Ms. Jackson\u2019s current lawyer about the case. Ms. Jackson\u2019s failure to abide by the seal on the case.\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nClaims by the attorney for Brook Jackson\n\nAt some point during the case, Ms. Jackson replaced her initial lawyers from the law firm of Berg and Androphy with attorney Robert Barnes. In a video shared on Rumble by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch, Mr. Barnes claimed that Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss their grounds for dismissal is:\n\n\u2026that it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted fraudulent certifications to the government, it doesn\u2019t matter if they submitted false statements under penalty of perjury to the government. It doesn\u2019t matter if they lied about the safety and efficacy of these drugs mislabeled in my opinion as vaccines. Because the government was in with them on it. The government knows what\u2019s going on and the government still has given them the check anyway. Was it really fraud if the government is their co-conspirator? That is in essence Pfizer\u2019s defense to the case.\n\nA few things about this. First, by trying to claim Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is not a vaccine, Mr. Barnes puts himself strongly in the anti-vaccine camp. Second, this is a serious misrepresentation of Pfizer\u2019s position.\n\nHere is Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss. Note that in no place does Pfizer say it committed fraud. In fact, Pfizer says it did not. First, as a technical point, Pfizer points out that their invoices to the Department of Defense did not include \u2013 and were not required to include \u2013 a certification of compliance with the regulations. Pfizer says: \u201cPfizer\u2019s invoices do not contain certifications of compliance with FAR or any other federal regulations. Pfizer instead certified, in a more limited way, that \u201cthe amounts invoiced [were] for costs incurred in accordance with the agreement, the work reflected ha[d] been performed, and prior payment ha[d] not been received.\u201d This certification is a truthful one, and it has nothing to do with the regulatory provisions cited in Relator\u2019s complaint\u201d. The \u201crelator\u201d is the term used for a citizen bringing a false claims act on the government\u2019s behalf.\n\nSecond, Pfizer points out that \u201c[t]he Government has also clearly rejected Relator\u2019s allegations by issuing a recent public statement expressing \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the data supporting authorization and approval of Pfizer\u2019s product.\u201d In other words, far from accepting that Ms. Jackson shows fraud, Pfizer is saying that FDA agrees that Ms. Jackson did not. FDA does not have to accept Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims of problems. And even if they accepted her claims, they do not have to go from regulatory violations to saying that they were frauds. Here, they did not. FDA\u2019s response suggests not that they\u2019re conspiring with Pfizer, but that they do not think that there was a fraud.\n\nThird, Mr. Barnes\u2019 claims are also misleading on the law. The core of the False Claims Act is that the citizen is bringing a claim on behalf of the government to recoup money the government was defrauded of. In fact, 70% of any recouping would go to the government and only 30% to the citizen. If the government claims \u201cwe were not misled\u201d, there is no such fraud. The government is not a co-conspirator in that case; the payment claim was simply not a fraud.\n\nIn essence, Mr. Barnes is misrepresenting Pfizer\u2019s response that \u201cwe did not mislead the government, among other things because the government knows of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims and does not think it paid on a fraud\u201d as saying something very different. Mr. Barnes, as a lawyer suing under the act, should know this.\n\nBreaking of the Seal\n\nClaims brought under the False Claims Act are sealed for at least 60 days to allow the government to decide if to take the claim over, and that period can be extended.\n\nIn this case, the case was filed in January 2021. The government decided not to intervene on January 18, 2022. The case was unsealed on February 10, 2022. But on January 17, 2022, Ms. Jackson Tweeted the complaint\u2019s front page and several claims from it. Even before that, in November 2021 the BMJ published an article by a free-lance journalist based on the claims of the complaint. As part of its motion to dismiss, Ventavia pointed to this violation of the seal requirement, and to cases showing dismissal of claims because of similar violations of seal.\n\nSimilarly, Pfizer requested staying even partial discovery in part because it pointed out that Brook Jackson cannot be relied upon to respect the confidentiality of documents, even if she promises to do so, based on this.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it had taken over a year \u2013 not sixty days \u2013 for the government to respond and say they will not intervene in the case. That\u2019s a long time to keep a complaint under seal, and it seems tricky to force litigants to wait.\n\nOn the other hand, false claim act claims are not usual claims. They are mechanisms for citizens to bring claims against the government, and the claim really is in the name of the government. Brook Jackson did not bring a personal wrongful dismissal claim (though she did include a retaliation claim against Ventavia), she is bringing a claim for false payment to the government. And when she\u2019s doing that, she should respect the rules of the game \u2013 and yes, it does raise questions, since she ignored the sealing requirements here, whether she will respect any confidentiality requirements going forward.\n\nSo what now?\n\nBefore the court now are the complaints and the motion to dismiss. The court set a schedule for hearing them. The court partly \u201cgranted\u201d Pfizer\u2019s request to stay discovery but I\u2019m not quite sure what it means. The court referred to an earlier order that did allow limited discovery as needed for the motions to dismiss.\n\nAlthough the court did set trial dates, that does not mean they will happen \u2013 the next step really is litigating the motion to dismiss. In my view, Ms. Jackson\u2019s claim is highly problematic and very likely to be dismissed, but it will be months before it is resolved. In the meantime, it can be misused to generate an anti-vaccine talking point. I hope this post can help with that.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "Second COVID vaccine booster now or wait for the new vaccine?",
        "Someone asked me the other day whether she should get the extremely safe second COVID-19 vaccine booster now or wait for the new Omicron-adapted vaccines that are coming in the fall from Pfizer and Moderna. I didn\u2019t know the answer, so I thought I would investigate. Maybe it will help you or someone you know with that decision too.\n\nThe actual answer is a bit complicated, but there appear to be some good, solid recommendations coming from people who are experts in containing this pandemic. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBy the way, this old dinosaur got his first Moderna booster in October 2021 and received his second booster (this time Pfizer) in April 2022. I do practice what I rant about here!\n\nPhoto by Nataliya Vaitkevich on Pexels.com\n\nBooster recommendations\n\nRight now, the CDC has recommended the following for COVID-19 booster vaccines after receiving the Pfizer, Moderna, or JNJ vaccine primary doses:\n\nFor ages 17-49 years, one booster, preferably of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, 5 months after the final primary dose.\n\nFor adults 50 years and older, a second booster should be received at least 4 months after the first booster .\n\n. There are complicated recommendations for children and teens depending on which vaccine they have received, but teens mostly are recommended to get one booster.\n\nOther countries and the World Health Organization have similar recommendations.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a bit complicated as to who should get what booster at what age, the CDC has set up a booster calculator that gives you the correct recommendations. It clears up who should get what and when.\n\nThe BA.5 variant, and its subvariants, are now the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in the USA and many other countries, and it has drifted so much that protection from the first vaccine doses is now less effective, and those who received one COVID-19 vaccine booster last year have seen substantial reductions in immunity since those vaccinations.\n\nPhoto by Artem Podrez on Pexels.com\n\nSecond COVID-19 vaccine booster\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to be at least October before the new vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are available> Both vaccines have shown excellent ability to neutralize Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 though to a lesser extent than they do for BA.1.\n\nSo during the next 8-12 weeks, people, especially those vulnerable to the disease and its effects, are at substantial risk of becoming infected given the high infectivity of the Omicron subvariants. Even though the current vaccines are less effective against the Omicron variant (and its subvariants), they do reduce the likelihood of ending up in the hospital. Or ending up dead.\n\nIn a paper published on 25 April 2022 in Nature Medicine, 563,465 participants ages 60 to 100 who had received their first booster more than four months previously found substantial reductions in hospitalizations and deaths among those who received a second booster compared with those who had received only their first booster.\n\nThe results were:\n\n270 of the 328,597 people who received a second booster were hospitalized during the 40-day study period.\n\n550 of the 234,868 who did not get a second booster were hospitalized.\n\n92 of those who received the second booster during the study period died due to COVID-19.\n\n232 died who had received just one dose.\n\nThe likelihood of death increased with age.\n\nAccording to CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker, in April 2022, people 50 years and older who received the primary vaccine series but only one booster dose had a 4-fold higher risk of death from COVID-19 compared with those who received both booster doses. The tracker shows that only 27.7% of those 50 years and older and 34.4% of those 65 and older have received their second booster.\n\nWhite House COVID-19 Response Team coordinator Ashish Jha, MD offered this guidance during a briefing on 19 July 2020:\n\nIn terms of what to recommend to people right now, if you\u2019re over 50 and if you\u2019ve not gotten a shot in 2022, first of all, getting one now protects you for the rest of the summer into the fall. Second, it does not preclude you from being able to get a bivalent vaccine in the fall. So that\u2019s why I think for me, it\u2019s a very, very clear recommendation.\n\nBecause of the expected demand for the new bivalent vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna this fall, the Biden administration has agreed to purchase more than 100 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. They will probably also purchase more of the Moderna vaccine, though that is not clear at the moment.\n\nBoth vaccines should have the Omicron variant and subvariant targets, though there could be delays which could mean missing the Fall target. Remember, they haven\u2019t submitted data to the FDA for these new vaccines, the FDA and the CDC have not reviewed the data, and manufacturing has not been scaled up. Although Pfizer and Moderna have an excellent record in getting their COVID-19 vaccines to the general population, I\u2019ll remain optimistic.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty clear \u2014 get the second COVID-19 vaccine booster as soon as possible even though the new vaccines might become available in a couple of months. The risk of hospitalization and death is much higher in those without the second booster, and we don\u2019t know if there will be a delay in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines this fall.\n\nDon\u2019t take this recommendation just because I wrote it. The evidence supports it. And public health experts support it.\n\nCitations\n\nArbel R, Sergienko R, Friger M, Peretz A, Beckenstein T, Yaron S, Netzer D, Hammerman A.

        "Combined flu and COVID vaccines associated with mild reactions",
        "A new study examined the incidence of mild reactions after individuals have received the flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time. The researchers did not find anything to be of concern, but I always like to get ahead of a story and discuss it so I (and you) are prepared to deal with the inevitable anti-vaccine meme or trope.\n\nSince COVID-19 cases will probably be increasing this fall (in fact, it\u2019s already increasing), we will probably need another booster this fall.

The study used self-reported data from 981,099 people after vaccination. Data were collected from 22 September 2021 to 1 May 2022 via the voluntary application v-safe, a smartphone-based monitoring system.\n\nHere are some of the results:\n\nApproximately 8% more individuals reported adverse events after the flu and Pfizer COVID-19 booster vaccines compared to the booster alone (adjusted odds ratio = 1.08).\n\nApproximately 11% more reports with the flu and Moderna booster compared to the booster alone (adjusted OR=1.11).\n\nThe excess systemic reactions resulted in mostly mild symptoms including fatigue, headache, and myalgia.\n\nIn other words, there was just a minor increase in reported adverse effects when both vaccines were given at the same time.

        "2 Years In: Is the COVID-19 Pandemic Transitioning to Endemic?",
        "It\u2019s been two years since COVID-19 was officially named a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it seems we are finally on the edge of moving from a pandemic to an endemic.\n\nBut what does this mean\u2014and what lessons can we take with us as we think about COVID-19 staying with us, or perhaps the next pandemic that may come sooner than we\u2019d like?\n\n\u201cYear 2 showed us that there's some durability to these vaccines,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, BIO\u2019s Vice President of Infectious Diseases & Emerging Science. \u201cYear 2 showed us that we can vaccinate at younger ages, and we found that heterologous boosting could actually lead to very interesting duration protection, which is a powerful thing scientifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing we learned in Year 2 was the power of activating messengers to talk to their specific community about vaccination is incredibly important and that that is what we need to be doing across all kinds of health care,\u201d continued Arthur. \u201cThe lack of understanding also opened the window for those who are anti-vaccine to actually take advantage of those misgivings. And people spread misinformation in communities that they weren't even a part of.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest vaccination campaign in American history\u2014but not everyone\u2019s on board. New #IamBIO Podcast episode features the voices of vaccine hesitancy and leaders building vaccine confidence, featuring @DrReedTuckson of the @BCAgainstCOVID. Listen: https://t.co/ckDrxBcU7R pic.twitter.com/OGqsUDZ7UQ \u2014 I Am Biotech (@IAmBiotech) April 20, 2021\n\n\u201cWhat does the end of the pandemic look like?\u201d asked Arthur. \u201cFor me, it's the stabilization of the incidence of disease and prevalence of the strains. That change is coming [\u2026] If you can literally, generally manage the number of people who are ill and hospitalized with existing medicine and have relatively controlled, or no, breakthroughs amongst people who are vaccinated, then we are kind of where the flu is.\u201d\n\nBut it is important to plan for the next pandemic now. \u201cEverybody wants to get on with the rest of their lives, and this is fine for the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the legislators and the administration needs to actually take the moment to step back and look at this and ask, what are the systems and safeguards I need to keep?\u201d\n\nWhy IP protection is critical to pandemic preparedness\n\nThe proposed waiver of IP for COVID vaccine technology could counteract future pandemic preparedness. While some have argued a waiver of the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would facilitate COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution, the exact opposite is true, experts told us.\n\nWe\u2019ll say it again: Waiving IP rights would compromise global vaccination efforts. \u201cThey argue that eliminating IP protections would allow any willing company to produce lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, making them cheaper and more widely accessible in low-income nations,\u201d BIO\u2019s Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath responded succinctly. \u201cIf true, that would be a compelling argument. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe problem with access is not so cut and dry, BIO\u2019s Senior Manager of International Affairs, Hillary Stiss, explains: \u201cIt is not an issue of IP that is preventing people from getting vaccines particularly in Africa. Really it is issues around African healthcare systems not being able to absorb vaccines and deliver it into arms.\u201d\n\nAs Hans Sauer, BIO\u2019s Deputy General Counsel and Vice President for Intellectual Property, further explained, there have been over 30 COVID vaccines developed\u2014not just the Pfizer, Modern, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines\u2014apparently without interference by anyone's patent rights. So, the idea that patents are getting in the way is incorrect.\n\nYet the very arguments used by governments to waive COVID IP rights seem to be a red herring to deflect from problematic global north government policy, while simultaneously disrespecting the work done by the private sector to step up and address this pandemic in record time \u2013 all with the added risk of disrupting investment, as well as R&D within biotech companies that would do absolutely nothing to help safeguard against the next big pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are certain folks who are willing to trade the next decades\u2019 innovation for access today as opposed to thinking of ways to manage access in a way that doesn't trade future innovation,\u201d noted Arthur.\n\n\u201cYou don't sell the rug out from under companies in order to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cCompanies' memories are actually quite long and if we have another pandemic and ask companies to help after forcing them to share their trade secrets they are going to resist.\n\nBiotech's Response to COVID-19, 2020-2022 Timeline\n\nYear 1"

        "Biotech Changed COVID; Did COVID Change Biotech?",
        "COVID changed our world forever\u2014no one will forget the profound effect this modern pandemic has had on our everyday lives. Thankfully, we finally see the end of the pandemic, thanks in large part to the biotechnology industry. Without its immediate and tireless work to figure out what COVID-19 was, to develop therapeutics to treat it, and to finally find a way to protect against it with several vaccines, we might still be in dire straits today.\n\nBiotech definitively changed COVID, but did the virus change our industry? Today, we speak with experts about the lasting effect the pandemic has had on biotech and what changes we expect to see permanently.\n\nThe transmission and spread of COVID highlighted how intricately everything on the planet is connected\u2014the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real basics behind the One Health concept is that the health of people, the health of animals, and the health of our environment are inextricably linked. So, changes in one affect the others,\u201d explains Dr. William Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy at the Echo Health Alliance. \u201cOne Health brings that together \u2013 rather than saying that human health and animal health, environmental health are separate and can be addressed separately, they can\u2019t be addressed separately because they interact so much.\u201d\n\nWith that idea of connection and oneness comes a natural need for collaboration, which we saw first-hand in the fight against COVID-19. Cartier Esham, BIO\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, says \u201ccompanies jumped in because they wanted to help solve the global crisis\u2026It was their challenge to meet; and they did so.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd we are thankful they did.\n\nIt was truly an all-hands-on deck approach. Companies in the space pivoted from research projects to help. Aaron Sato, Chief Scientific Officer of Twist Bioscience, said that the company was able to provide scientific researchers at other biotech companies with synthetic versions of the virus to study which minimized their exposure risk. Helping other companies was not a fiscal decision, but a moral one.\n\nBecause of this collaboration for the public good, public opinion of the biotech industry has drastically improved. Ron Foshay of Service Research Insights says \u201cthe extraordinary effort made to develop safe and effective vaccines, one survey reported, shows that positive ratings of pharmaceutical companies went from 32% in early 2020 to 62% in early 2021. That\u2019s a really big jump.\u201d\n\nCollaboration and improved public opinion weren\u2019t the only good outcomes to come from battling COVID-19. Karesh highlights another \u2013 greater public understanding of the industry and clinical testing as a whole. And Esham hopes that the COVID-era change in clinical testing practices of bringing trials to patients will have a profound and beneficial impact on clinical trials of the future.\n\nBiotechnology has always been home to rapidly changing science, but COVID-19 fundamentally reshaped tenets of the industry in a way that will likely benefit more people.\n\nListen to the entire episode here.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies."

        "Despite the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Bioscience Economy Remains Resilient",
        "Throughout 2021, there was a great deal of advances in the biotechnology sector in the United States \u2013 thanks, in part, to state-led and regional economic development initiatives which have created jobs, advanced educational opportunities, and championed innovation.\n\nAccording to the recently published report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and the Council of State Bioscience Associations (CSBA), \u201cDriving the Bioscience Economy Forward During the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d, state and regional initiatives ensured that the United States continues to be competitive in the global marketplace as a leader in the bioscience industry.\n\nThe purpose of the report is \u201cto help our partners out there \u2026 understand how we are a part of the larger ecosystem in a growing number of states,\u201d said Pete Pellerito, Senior Policy Adviser for Federal/State Economic Development & Technology Transfer Lead at BIO. \u201cThis report really reinforces the depth and the diversity of our geographic footprint in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can build all the new buildings we want, we can bring all the new equipment we want, have all the intellectual property in place, but if we don\u2019t have the people to drive it \u2026 [all] forward, any state, any region, is going to be at a disadvantage,\u201d Pellerito continued.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. bioscience industry employs 1.87 million people across more than 101,000 U.S. businesses.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how states are driving the bioscience economy.\n\nBiomanufacturing\n\nBiomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that leverages biological systems for the production of commercially vital biomolecules and biomaterials for medicines, food, and beverage processing as well as industrial use. State-level measures noted in the report to advance biomanufacturing include Ohio\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, which is a competitive grant program to encourage new advanced manufacturing project and service activity.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state\u2019s Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) provides hands-on education and training both in biomanufacturing methods as well as bioprocessing concepts. This training and education is in full compliance with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), a set of regulations published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, North Carolina provides both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) state matching grants as well as a manufacturing sales tax exemption on equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Connecticut has a Manufacturing Innovation Fund that offers worker training and apprenticeship programs, loans, grants, and vouchers. In addition, the state is aiming to support the creation of at least 15,000 new jobs over the next five years in advanced manufacturing, data science, and insurance technology.\n\nThe importance of public-private partnership\n\nPublic-private partnerships will continue to be key to the development of the bioscience industry in the United States.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Harvard and MIT came together in 2021 to start building a 40,000 square foot facility to create partnerships between the biopharmaceutical sector, academia, and medical leaders to advance the development of new treatment technologies for patients. The state government of Massachusetts is involved in this effort through the Massachusetts Life Science Center.\n\nOver in Tennessee, the state has directed $2.5 million of the state\u2019s budget during the 2021-2022 fiscal year towards the development of public-private partnerships to develop animal health drug products by working with universities, which have strong veterinary medicine and agricultural programs that study animal dermatological conditions and cancers.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the bioscience industry?\n\nAs the 2022 elections are approaching, Pellerito stated \u201cI have never felt that support for our industry has been partisan. I think it\u2019s very bipartisan.\u201d\n\nNo matter what the political winds have in store later this year, the biotech sector will continue to play an integral role in job creation and innovation across different states and regions, he said.\n\nWhen asked regarding what efforts are being made to advance opportunities for members of historically underrepresented communities across different states and regions, Pellerito pointed to BIO\u2019s BIOEquality Agenda, stating that increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the bioscience industry is of the utmost importance both to BIO members as well as to various academic partners.\n\nAs the report makes clear, despite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bioscience industry is in a strong position for continued growth. Ultimately, the success of the industry is dependent upon maintaining and expanding existing partnerships, all while creating new ones to further advance the opportunities that it provides in the communities it collaborates with and serves."

        "COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of death from COVID-19; the vaccines don\u2019t alter our DNA",
        "CLAIM Canadian data shows vaccinated people more likely to die from COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccines alter our DNA; hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19 more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Charlie Kirk, The Charlie Kirk Show, 17 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t alter people\u2019s DNA.\n\nMisrepresents a complex reality: The age-standardized rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths don\u2019t account for important differences in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, such as a higher proportion of people with underlying health conditions among vaccinated people. Therefore, such rates don't necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness.\n\nUnsupported: Studies so far have shown that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are ineffective at treating or preventing COVID-19. KEY TAKE AWAY Studies show that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t alter people\u2019s DNA. No reliable scientific evidence shows that hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin cure COVID-19.\n\nFULL CLAIM: \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID\u201d; \u201cWhy aren't they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d; \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nREVIEW\n\nOn 17 July 2022, political activist Charlie Kirk published a video on Facebook, claiming that Canadian data showed COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of death from COVID-19. The video was viewed more than 720,000 times and shared more than 21,000 times. Kirk also rehashed old, inaccurate, and misleading claims that COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19, which have already been debunked by fact-checkers before, as we will show below.\n\nClaim 1 (Incorrect): \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID.\u201d\n\nKirk cited an article by journalist Alex Berenson to support this claim. Berenson, who made multiple inaccurate and misleading claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, claimed in a Substack article that data from the Manitoban government showed that, vaccinated people \u201cwere about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die of Covid than unvaccinated people\u201d in May 2022. Below is the graph referenced by Berenson.\n\n\n\nThe age-standardized rate of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths associated with COVID-19 in Manitoba for April (top) and May (bottom) 2022. Note how the trends in April contrast with those in May.\n\nWhile the data presented here accounted for differences in risk due to age\u2014which is important because severe COVID-19 is associated with advanced age\u2014 the difference in the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and the amount of time a person spent in each vaccination status, there are other important factors that remain unaccounted for. For example, people with preexisting health conditions that increase their risk of severe COVID-19 are more likely to be overrepresented among vaccinated people. This, along with differences in infection levels, different variants, and differing levels in immunity from prior infection, mean that age-standardized rates don\u2019t necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness, as the UK Office of National Statistics cautioned:\n\n\u201cThe [age-standardized mortality rates] give the age-adjusted risk of death for the people in the different vaccination status groups. Estimating vaccine effectiveness is challenging when vaccination status is not allocated at random, as factors that vary between the vaccination status groups and over time need to be accounted for to determine the causal impact of vaccines on mortality.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the data showed a different trend in April 2022, just a month before the one that Berenson used, indicating a lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths in both the vaccinated and the people who received a booster dose. Therefore, Berenson may have cherry-picked data that supported the narrative he wished to present and left out data that conflicted with his narrative.\n\nIf the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, as Berenson and Kirk claimed, we would expect to see the same or even more pronounced trend in people who received a booster dose (the blue bar in the graph), since these people received the most doses among the three groups. However, the rate of death in people who received a booster dose is the same as in unvaccinated people, not higher. Berenson himself was aware of this, as he wrote: \u201cPeople who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated\u201d. Nevertheless, he went on to claim that the \u201cdata show vaccines now RAISE the risk of death from Covid\u201d, which is demonstrably false.\n\nData for the whole of Canada\u2014which provides a larger sample size than just Manitoba alone\u2014also contradict Berenson\u2019s claim. Health Canada reported that from 9 May to 5 June 2022, \u201cunvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series. During the same 4-week period, unvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 6 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series and 1 or more additional doses\u201d.\n\nLarge-scale studies support this observation, finding that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death. Indeed, a modeling study published in The Lancet Infectious Disease estimated that COVID-19 vaccination saved tens of millions of lives globally[1]. While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has dampened vaccine effectiveness against disease[2,3], getting vaccinated remains safer than not getting vaccinated.\n\nClaim 2 (Misrepresents source): \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nAs evidence for this claim, Kirk highlighted a Fox News segment from 12 July 2022, in which Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, said:\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s clear from the data [is] that even though vaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well, as it were, against infection, they protect quite well against severe disease leading to hospitalization and death.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kirk only presented the part where Fauci said that \u201cvaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well\u201d, leaving out the rest in which he clarified that COVID-19 vaccines are still effective at keeping people from becoming seriously ill and dying. By doing so, Kirk distorted the meaning of Fauci\u2019s words.\n\nClaim 3 (Factually inaccurate): COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d\n\nThis old claim is false and has been refuted many times. As explained in numerous fact-checks, the COVID-19 vaccines cannot alter our DNA. The mRNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are unable to directly integrate into our DNA, because RNA is chemically different from DNA.\n\nNevertheless, some continued to propagate this false claim through various means, such as by citing an inaccurate Forbes article headline or a study by Lund University, which allegedly showed that RNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reverse-transcribed, or converted into DNA, and entered the cells. The study set out to determine if mRNA from the vaccine was reverse-transcribed and if so, whether the resulting DNA entered the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is stored. The experiments were conducted in human liver cells originating from a hepatocarcinoma (liver cancer). As this Health Feedback review explained, the experiments didn\u2019t show that vaccine mRNA was reverse-transcribed or that foreign DNA entered the nucleus of the cells, much less integrate into cell DNA.\n\nClaim 4 (Unsupported): \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d\n\nEarly in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin were touted by some as preventative and curative medicine for COVID-19. However, there is no reliable scientific evidence to support this claim. As we reported in previous Health Feedback reviews, large-scale randomized controlled trials, including those conducted by the University of Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, didn\u2019t find any of these drugs to be effective at reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19[4-7].\n\nREFERENCES"

        "Washington Times article by Robert Malone and Peter Navarro relies on inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims about virus evolution, vaccine immunity, and COVID-19 vaccine safety",
        "Three scientists analyzed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading.\n\n1.3k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis Washington Times opinion piece, published on 5 August 2021, made multiple claims about the evolution of virus variants, immune escape, as well as COVID-19 vaccine safety. Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nMalone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable.\n\nThe key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.]\n\nExperts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.]\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d\n\nEmma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument.\n\n\u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d\n\nIndeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination.\n\nIn addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d\n\nFisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nSome of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said.\n\nAll three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said.\n\nScientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for.\n\nBut even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations.\n\nOn the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible.\n\nYou can read the original Washington Times article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK:\n\nEmma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel:\n\nI will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this.\n\nViruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease.\n\nFor most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms.\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes.\n\nWe see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\nThus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both.\n\nWhat\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination.\n\nFinally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation.\n\nIn short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination.\n\nFinally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected).\n\nExposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent.\n\nDale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore:\n\nThis article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO.\n\nFlawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission.\n\nFlawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies.\n\nFlawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\n\nFlawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice.\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, Research Fellow, Singapore Immunology Network:\n\nThe article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place:\n\nAbout assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\n\nSome of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it!\n\nAbout assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links.\n\nIt is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination.\n\nAbout assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity.\n\nANNOTATIONS\n\nThe statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity).\n\n\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does, that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\n\u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201c\n\nIn fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected)."

        "Misleading Wall Street Journal opinion piece makes the unsubstantiated claim that the U.S. will have herd immunity by April 2021",
        "Analysis of \"We'll Have Herd Immunity by April\" Published in Wall Street Journal , by Marty Makary on\n\nThree scientists analysed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be very low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Cherry picking, Misleading, Overstates scientific confidence.\n\n2.2k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis Wall Street Journal opinion piece, published on 18 February 2021, claimed in its headline that the U.S. will \u201chave herd immunity by April\u201d. Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias/Fact Check.\n\nHerd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\n\u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d\n\nThe headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.]\n\nMarm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated.\n\nKilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population.\n\n\u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d\n\nThe article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population.\n\n\u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d\n\nIn short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded.\n\nApart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity.\n\nTara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2].\n\nVirologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d.\n\nEric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread:\n\nNo, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https://t.co/xkAQKU1hg6\n\n\u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity\n\n\u20142/3 of the US population has not had covid\n\n\u2014Wrong on T-cell protection\n\n\u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective\n\n\u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021\n\nWilliam Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading.\n\n\u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said.\n\nAs reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d\n\nCuriously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection.\n\nOne reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor.\n\n\u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said.\n\nCases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed.\n\nIn summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave.\n\nWhile the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants.\n\nMasks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021\n\nFormer director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d\n\nYou can read the original Wall Street Journal article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK\n\nA. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz:\n\nThe article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent).\n\n1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\n\n2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1].\n\nUsing the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims.\n\nThus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data.\n\nTara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University:\n\nThere are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2].\n\nWilliam Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health:\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\nThe estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000/million in Virginia, and about 300/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing.\n\nThere are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection.\n\nThe article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7].\n\nFinally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination.\n\nREFERENCES"

        "Debunking 30 bad arguments about COVID/vaccines",
        "The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place.\n\nThis article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence.\n\nMany of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories:\n\n1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk/mortality rates\n\n9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines\n\n14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness\n\n21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science\n\n24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s do this.\n\nBad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous\n\nReality: Yes it is; millions are dead\n\nOver 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nBad argument #2: 99.9% survive\n\nReality: That still means millions of deaths\n\nThe survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities.\n\nReality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID\n\nComorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions).\n\nMore details here.\n\nBad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu\n\nReality: Yes it is\n\nIn the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu.\n\nBad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine\n\nReality: You can still become seriously ill and/or spread it to others\n\nBeing young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #).\n\nAlso see #25\n\nBad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines\n\nReality: Your immune system is only as good as its training\n\nEven a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d\n\nDetails here\n\nBad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines\n\nReality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died.\n\nHomo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t\n\nReality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous\n\nEarly evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations.\n\nBad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA\n\nReality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering.\n\nDNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #10: The vaccines are too new/rushed\n\nReality: No, they aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects\n\nReality: Yes, we do\n\nNo vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will.\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine\n\nReality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing\n\nAgain, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies.\n\nBad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated\n\nReality: They are safer with vaccines\n\nHospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022).\n\nIn contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022).\n\nBad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective\n\nReality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful\n\nThis one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16).\n\nMore details here and here.\n\nBad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases)\n\nReality: They reduce risk and severity\n\nAgain, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)!\n\nThis argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs.\n\nUpdate 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine.\n\nBad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID\n\nReality: They reduce risk of transmission\n\nVaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you.\n\nBad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated\n\nReality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers\n\nThis claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15).\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron\n\nReality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness\n\nOmicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021).\n\nSee #20 on boosters\n\nBad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated?\n\nReality: Because I care about others\n\nVaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc.\n\nBad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three\n\nReality: So what? Why is that a problem?\n\nBad argument #21: But science has been wrong before\n\nReality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works\n\nScience is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines.\n\nDetails here and here.\n\nAlso, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus\n\nReality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right\n\nGalileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21).\n\nDetails here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe\n\nReality: No there wasn\u2019t\n\nThis is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22).\n\nSee posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies/It\u2019s all about money\n\nReality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other\n\nSee posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument.\n\nBad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes]\n\nReality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science\n\nThe fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation.\n\nAdditionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet.\n\nMore details here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS\n\nReality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem\n\nVAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25).\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines\n\nReality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks\n\nAdverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021).\n\nSee studies cited in #10, 13\u201316\n\nBad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories/FDA corruption\n\nReality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd.\n\nBad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates\n\nReality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health\n\nThis is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers).\n\nBad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026\n\nReality: Those are not good sources\n\nPlease just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.\n\nMore on fact checking\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "Future (\u201clong-term\u201d) side effects from COVID vaccines are extremely unlikely",
        "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "The \u201c99% survive COVID\u201d argument is deceptive and completely misses the point",
        "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

        "Future (\u201clong-term\u201d) side effects from COVID vaccines are extremely unlikely",
        "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "COVID comorbidities are not analogous to car crashes: Debunking the 6% mortality claim",
        "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter."

        "COVID comorbidities are not analogous to car crashes: Debunking the 6% mortality claim",
        "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter."

        "The \u201c99% survive COVID\u201d argument is deceptive and completely misses the point",
        "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited"

        "Jon Stewart\u2019s irresponsible, anti-science, COVID conspiracy theory rant",
        "I\u2019ve been a fan of Jon Stewart for a long time. I usually find him to be both funny and insightful. It was, therefore, with great dismay that I watched him spread a conspiracy theory and inaccuracies about science on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and I regret that it is now my duty to explain his errors.\n\nIn the clip, which you can see here, Stewart begins by saying that we owe a great debt to science for helping to ameliorate the COVID19 crisis. That much I absolutely agree with. Scientists deserve an enormous amount of gratitude for developing the vaccines that are currently saving lives and reducing suffering around the world. Unfortunately, the interview quickly took a turn for a worse as Stewart endorsed the conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID19 escaped from the lab in Wuhan and made numerous dangerous, false statements about how scientists operate.\n\nMischaracterizations of science and scientists\n\nBefore I get to the conspiracy theory, I want to respond to a more general comment he made which really bothered me, because it is a common and damaging misconception about science and scientists. He said,\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with science. Science is incredible, but they don\u2019t know where to stop, and nobody in the room with those cats ever goes, \u2018ya know, I don\u2019t know if we should do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is an inherently untrue statement that is, unfortunately, a very common misconception about science, perhaps most famously stated by Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park as, \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d\n\nIn reality, most of us scientists spend a great deal of time thinking about the implications of our work and whether it is a good idea, and even if we didn\u2019t want to do that, we are forced to do that by ethics committees. The days of \u201cmad scientists\u201d operating in isolation doing dangerous, unethical experiments are long gone. In modern science, you have to submit proposals before you do research, and those proposals get reviewed by ethics boards (which, btw, usually include scientists and non-scientists) who will approve, reject, or insist on modifications to your proposal. If you get approved, you then have to submit reports on what you actually did, and there are usually audits. Further, if you want to work with something dangerous, you often need additional government clearance and approval. Things are checked and regulated, particularly in a major lab like the one in Wuhan.\n\nIndeed, Stewart went on to give an example that undercut his whole argument. In a deranged monologue in which he asserted (I hope jokingly) that scientists would be the death of humanity, he inaccurately described scientists\u2019 re-animation of the virus that caused the 1918 flu,\n\n\u201cThey had a little sample of [the virus], and it hadn\u2019t been a scourge in the earth for 100 years, and they thought to themselves, \u2018what if we just, I don\u2019t know, woke it up?\u2019 And nobody in the room was like, \u2018No. Let\u2019s not do that.'\u201d\n\nThe reality of the situation was quite different. The research was conducted by the CDC and went through both an Institutional Biosafety Committee review and an Animal Care and Use Committee review before being conducted. The risks and benefits were carefully thought out, evaluated, and discussed by several groups of people, and very strict bio-safety guidelines were put in place and followed. This wasn\u2019t a scientist working in their garage doing whatever popped into their head. It was, carefully planned, well-thought out, closely monitored, rigorously controlled research in a secure, state-of-the-art laboratory (you can read the details on the CDC\u2019s website).\n\nTo be 100% clear, that obviously does not mean that no one ever goes rogue and operates outside of the system. There will always be people who break the rules, but those cases are rare, they are pretty close to impossible at a lab facility like Wuhan, and when those people get caught, the consequences are generally serious (such as loss of funding, loss of job, and sometimes prosecution). So, this notion that no one is telling scientists not to do things is simply false. There are constantly people checking our proposals and telling us not to do things.\n\nThis misconception matters, because it paints scientists as people who are totally disconnected from reality, blindly doing whatever interests us regardless of the dangers, but that\u2019s a caricature, not reality. Scientists are normal people. We think about things like ethics and broad implications, and we have people checking us. Further, this sort of caricature downplays the importance of labs like the Wuhan lab. It\u2019s not full of \u201cmad scientists.\u201d It\u2019s full of incredibly intelligent, thoughtful people doing important work that needs to be done if we are going to prevent future disease outbreaks and mitigate the ones that we fail to prevent. Indeed, that Spanish Flu research that Stewart mocked gave us important insights into how highly virulent pathogens operate, and those insights help us to prepare for future outbreaks. This sort of mischaracterization of scientists undermines the critical work that scientists do.\n\nThe lab leak conspiracy theory\n\nMoving on, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail debunking the Wuhan lab leak conspiracy theory, because it has been thoroughly covered elsewhere (e.g., Siegel 2021). Instead, I\u2019ll just hit a few highlights and point out some errors in Stewart\u2019s reasoning. Before I start, I do realize that much of what he said was deliberate hyperbole for comedic effect, so I have no intention of nitpicking his jokes and will instead focus on the broad strokes.\n\nThe crux of his argument was basically just proximity:\n\nThere is a lab in Wuhan that studies novel coronaviruses The novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan Therefore, it escaped from the lab\n\nTo anyone familiar with logic, this reasoning is clearly fallacious. It\u2019s a non sequitur fallacy. Just because the two things occurred in proximity doesn\u2019t mean that there was any relationship between them (note: you might argue that this is a correlation fallacy, but that generally involves trends, not isolated incidents; it is arguably a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy [i.e., there was a lab in Wuhan, then there was an outbreak; therefore the lab caused the outbreak]).\n\nIt is entirely possible for the co-occurrence of two things to be a coincidence, or for there to be some other factor that caused those two things to line up. In this case, the latter is true. Infectious disease labs very often focus on the pathogens around them, and as Colbert tried to point out to Stewart, China has many coronaviruses, and Wuhan is a massive city with an active wildlife trade. In other words, if a novel coronavirus was going to jump to humans, we would expect it to be in a city like Wuhan, which is why there was a coronavirus lab in Wuhan. As one virologist (Vincent Munster) commented,\n\n\u201cNine out of ten times, when there\u2019s a new outbreak, you\u2019ll find a lab that will be working on these kinds of viruses nearby\u201d (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021).\n\nSo, no, the fact that the outbreak originated in a city that has a coronavirus lab does not suggest that the outbreak was a result of a lab leak. That is extremely circumstantial evidence and totally ignores the fact that labs are often positioned in the areas where we\u2019d expect an outbreak.\n\nSimilarly, Stewart dismissed the abundance of bats around Wuhan by pointing out that there are also lots of bats in Texas, but the outbreak didn\u2019t start there. This is more specious logic (indeed, it\u2019s a reductio ad absurdum fallacy). It\u2019s not simply that there are bats in China, but rather that China is a hot spot of human-wildlife interactions. It is those interactions that are problematic and, it is something scientists have been warning about for years. Back in 2007, a paper in Clinical Microbiology Reviews said,\n\n\u201cThe presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb\u201d (Cheng et al. 2007).\n\nThis isn\u2019t a virus that came out of nowhere with no warnings. It\u2019s something scientists have worried about for a long time, which, once again, is why labs that study these diseases are so important, and why it is so dangerous to undercut them by spreading this kind of conspiracy theory. It\u2019s also, again, why this lab was in China.\n\nAs you can hopefully see, Stewart\u2019s arguments are bogus, but what should we make of the lab leak hypothesis more generally? As I said, I\u2019m not going to go into a ton of detail, because that is a whole series of posts in itself, but here are a few highlights.\n\nFirst, the WHO investigation into the Wuhan laboratory concluded that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the virus had escaped from the lab. Second, scientific assessments of the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 have shown that it is most likely natural. Andersen et al. (2020) found no evidence to suggest that it was man-made and,\n\n\u201cstrong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.\u201d\n\nIf the virus was engineered, we\u2019d see evidence of that in the genome, but we don\u2019t see that evidence. This is critical, because it means that even if it escaped from a lab, it was probably a natural virus that was being stored there, not one that was engineered. As you will see, however, the arguments for the lab leak hypothesis generally center around the virus not being natural (you can read more about this research and how we know the virus wasn\u2019t man-made in these articles: Bryner 2020; Hayes 2020; Saey 2020).\n\nSo, where does this leave the lab-leak hypothesis? It leaves it solidly in the territory of conspiracy theories that ignore official reports, cherry pick experts, and spin fanciful tales that attempt to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d based on circumstantial evidence. This hypothesis inherently requires that scientists and governments have lied and falsified records, but there is no actual evidence of that happening. It is just something that has to be blindly assumed in order for this conspiracy theory to be possible, and as a scientist, I have an aversion to making more assumptions than necessary.\n\nThe more scientific arguments for the lab leak hypothesis have tended to focus either on the fact that we have yet to find the original virus in the wild yet or on an unusual CGG-CGG sequence. The fact that we have not confirmed the original host is, however, hardly surprising. It often takes many years to track novel virus back to the original host. It took 14 years to find the origin of the SARS epidemic (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). So, 1.5 years of failed searching is hardly enough to conclude that it probably isn\u2019t natural. The other argument is that the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 has a CGG-CGG sequence that is unusual. CGG codes for the amino acid arginine, but there are several other ways to produce arginine, and CGG is relatively uncommon in coronavirus. This led David Baltimore to famously refer to the double CGG as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that the virus was man made. That statement was, however, misleading, because about 3% of the arginine sequences in SARS-CoV-2 are CGG, and CGG is found in plenty of other coronaviruses. It is, therefore, entirely possible for CGG-CGG to arise naturally, and even Baltimore has now acknowledged that it could be natural (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). Dr. Anderson, who wrote the study I mentioned earlier, explained the situation in more detail, here.\n\nFinally, what are we to make of various governments and even Dr. Fauci saying there should be thorough investigations? First, as I explained in a previous post this week, we should never conflate government decisions with scientific evidence. Second, if people like Fauci want more investigations, I don\u2019t really object (I don\u2019t think they are necessary, but I\u2019m not going to rant in opposition of them either). However, critically, as it stands right now, the weight of evidence is strongly against the lab leak hypothesis, and arguments to the contrary inevitably stray into the realm of conspiracy theories, conjecture, and baseless assumptions. As such, it is extremely problematic for a man like Stewart to insist on national television that the virus originated in a lab. Look, if you want to say, \u201cthe current evidence suggests that it did not escape the lab, but out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of being as certain as possible, we should conduct another investigation\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with that, but that is a very, very different thing from the type of proclamation that Stewart made or the types of conspiracy theories that I\u2019m seeing online. Further, it absolutely does not justify Stewart\u2019s rant about what he perceives as the dangers of science.\n\nLet me conclude this with a question. If you doubt the official reports and want another investigation, will you accept the results of that investigation if it shows the disease was natural? To put that another way, how many investigations are required to convince you? This is a question that is worth thinking about. It is always a good idea to ask yourself what it would take to convince you that you were wrong.\n\nUpdate 1-Sept-2021: A new review paper (Holmes et al. 2021) which was released after this post has reviewed the evidence for the lab leak hypothesis in even more detail, and concluded that the evidence strongly points away from that hypothesis.\n\nSources"

        "COVID-19 Slows Progress Towards Universal Energy Access",
        "Joint Press Release\n\nThe energy crisis arising from the war in Ukraine may lead to further setbacks\n\nWashington, June 1, 2022 \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic has been a key factor in slowing progress toward universal energy access. Globally, 733 million people still have no access to electricity, and 2.4 billion people still cook using fuels detrimental to their health and the environment. At the current rate of progress, 670 million people will remain without electricity by 2030 \u2013 10 million more than projected last year.\n\nThe 2022 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report shows that the impacts of the pandemic, including lockdowns, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. Advances have been impeded particularly in the most vulnerable countries and those already lagging in energy access. Nearly 90 million people in Asia and Africa who had previously gained access to electricity, can no longer afford to pay for their basic energy needs.\n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on energy have been compounded in the last few months by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to uncertainty in global oil and gas markets and has sent energy prices soaring.\n\nAfrica remains the least electrified in the world with 568 million people without electricity access. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of the global population without electricity jumped to 77 percent in 2020 from 71 percent in 2018 whereas most other regions saw declines in their share of the access deficits. While 70 million people globally gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, this progress was not enough to keep pace with population growth, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cInternational public financing for renewable energy needs to accelerate, especially in the poorest, most vulnerable countries. We have failed to support those most in need. With only eight years left to achieve universal access to affordable and sustainable energy, we need radical actions to accelerate the increase of international public financial flows and distribute them in a more equitable manner, so 733 million people who are currently left behind can enjoy the benefits of clean energy access.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\n\nThe report finds that despite continued disruptions in economic activity and supply chains, renewable energy was the only energy source to grow through the pandemic. However, these positive global and regional trends in renewable energy have left behind many countries most in need of electricity. This was aggravated by a decrease in international financial flows for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019.\n\nSDG7 targets also cover energy efficiency. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent. This is well below the levels needed to meet SDG 7\u2019s targets and to make up for lost ground, the average rate of improvement would have to jump to 3.2 percent.\n\nIn September 2021, the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy brought together governments and stakeholders to accelerate action to achieve a sustainable energy future that leaves no one behind. In this context, the SDG 7 custodian agencies, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), as they launch this report, are urging the international community and policymakers to safeguard gains toward SDG 7; to remain committed to continued action towards affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all; and to maintain a strategic focus on countries needing the most support.\n\nKey highlights on SDG 7 targets\n\nAccess to electricity. The share of the world\u2019s population with access to electricity rose from 83 percent in 2010 to 91 percent in 2020, increasing the number of people with access by 1.3 billion globally. The number without access declined from 1.2 billion people in 2010 to 733 million in 2020. However, the pace of progress in electrification has slowed in recent years which may be explained by the increasing complexity of reaching more remote and poorer unserved populations and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting the 2030 target requires increasing the number of new connections to 100 million a year. At current rates of progress, the world will reach only 92 percent electrification by 2030.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, every region of the world showed consistent progress in electrification, but with wide disparities. Electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 46 percent in 2018 to 48 percent in 2020, but the region\u2019s share of the global access deficit rose from 71 percent in 2018 to 77 percent in 2020, whereas most other regions, including Central and Southern Asia, saw declines in their share of the access deficits. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for more than three-quarters of the people (568 million people) who remained without access in 2020.\n\nClean cooking. The share of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies rose to 69% in 2020, an increase of 3 percentage points over last year. However, population growth outpaced much of the gains in access, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the total number of people lacking access to clean cooking has remained relatively stagnant for decades. Between 2000 and 2010, this number was close to three billion people, or one-third of the global population. It dropped to around 2.4 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in access in large, populous countries in Asia. In contrast, the access deficit in Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly doubled since 1990, reaching a total of around 923 million people in 2020.\n\nA multisectoral, coordinated effort is needed to achieve the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It is critical that the global community learns from the successes and challenges faced by countries that have attempted to design and implement clean household energy policies.\n\nRenewables. Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy implies accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity, heat, and transport. Although there is no quantitative target for SDG 7.2, custodian agencies agree that the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) needs to rise significantly, even though renewable energy consumption did continue to grow through the pandemic, overcoming disruptions to economic activity and supply chains. While the share of renewable capacity expansion rose by a record amount in 2021, the positive global and regional trajectories mask the fact that countries where new capacity additions lagged were those most in need of increased access. Moreover, rising commodity, energy and shipping prices, as well as restrictive trade measures, have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, and biofuels, adding uncertainty for future renewable energy projects. Renewable shares need to reach well over 30 percent of TFEC by 2030, up from 18 percent in 2019, to be on track for reaching net-zero energy emissions by 2050. Achieving this objective would require strengthening policy support in all sectors and implementing effective tools to further mobilize private capital, especially in least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing countries.\n\nEnergy efficiency. SDG 7.3 aims to double the global rate of annual improvement in primary energy intensity\u2014the amount of energy used per unit of wealth created\u2014to 2.6 percent in 2010\u201330 versus 1990\u20132010. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent, well below the target, and the average annual rate of improvement now has to reach 3.2 percent to make up for lost ground. This rate would need to be even higher\u2014consistently over 4 percent for the rest of this decade\u2014if the world is to reach net-zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050, as envisioned in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Early estimates for 2020 point to a substantial decrease in intensity improvement because of the COVID-19 crisis, as a result of a higher share of energy-intensive activities in the economy and lower energy prices. The outlook for 2021 suggests a return to a 1.9 percent rate of improvement, the average rate during the previous decade, thanks to a sharper focus on energy efficiency policies, particularly in COVID-19 recovery packages. However, energy efficiency policies and investment need to be scaled up significantly to bring the SDG 7.3 target within reach.\n\nInternational Financial Flows. International public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy decreased for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019, despite the immense needs for sustainable development in most countries and growing urgency of climate change. The amount was down by nearly 24 per cent from the previous year and may be worsened by the pandemic in 2020. Overall, the level of financing remains below what is needed to reach SDG 7, particularly in the most vulnerable and least developed countries.\n\nThe decrease was seen in most regions, with the only exception in Oceania, where international public flows rose by 72 percent. The bulk of decreases were concentrated in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, where they fell 66.2 percent; Latin America and the Caribbean, where they dropped by 29.8 percent; and Central and Southern Asia, where they declined by 24.5 percent.\n\nAlthough the private sector finances most renewable energy investments, public finance remains key to attract private capital, including for creating an enabling environment for private investments, developing the needed infrastructure, and addressing perceived and real risks and barriers for investments in the energy transition. International public flows to countries that lack the financial resources to support their energy transitions constitute a large part of the international collaboration that will be needed for a global energy transition that would bring the world closer to achieving all SDGs.\n\nIndicators and data for tracking progress. Tracking global progress for SDG 7 targets requires high-quality, reliable and comparable data for informed and effective policymaking at the global, regional, and country levels. The quality of data has been improving through national and international cooperation and solid statistical capacity. National data systems improve as countries establish legal frameworks and institutional arrangements for comprehensive data collection for energy supply and demand balances; implement end-user surveys (e.g., households, businesses, etc.); and develop quality-assurance frameworks. However, after the pandemic hit and disrupted the rate of progress toward Goal 7, more investment in quality statistics is needed to know where we stand and how to get back on track. This is especially important for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries, to inform their national energy policies and strategies to ensure no one is left behind.\n\nThis is the eighth edition of this report, formerly known as the Global Tracking Framework (GTF).

        "NIH-funded project offers efficient approach when tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants",
        "NIH-funded project offers efficient approach when tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nAn interdisciplinary research team has developed a fast, cost-effective method to detect the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The team, funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx\u00ae) Tech program, adopted a customizable genotyping approach to identify known variants and subvariants. The approach can augment current surveillance methods that use comprehensive next-generation sequencing of virus samples, helping focus sequencing efforts on samples representing unknown and emerging variants.\n\nIn their study, which published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, the research team proposed that genotyping could be effectively used for SARS-CoV-2 variant classification. Genotyping is a relatively low-cost, high-volume laboratory technique used by thousands of clinical laboratories across the country with minimal hardware and software requirements. The technique zeroes in on genetic reference points, or markers, and limits the intense process of sequencing a 30,000 base-pair SARS-CoV-2 genome to a focus set of about 45 or less of the relevant alterations that distinguish the variety of subvariants in circulation at a given time. It is performed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique that already makes up a portion of the laboratory testing for COVID-19. The team showed that known variants can be successfully identified in one to two days, for a fraction of the cost of next-generation sequencing.\n\nThe research team is part of the RADx Tech program Variant Task Force (VTF). RADx Tech is led by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) at NIH. \u201cThe work of the task force offers a method that can be widely adopted and improve data gathering and reporting,\u201d said NIBIB Director Bruce J. Tromberg, Ph.D. \u201cAs variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge, it is critical to know where they are spreading and how rapidly, so countermeasures can be implemented. With this method we can develop new assays and get them into labs about two weeks after identifying a new variant.\u201d\n\nWhile reported cases of COVID-19 have topped 400 million globally, only a fraction of positive test samples are sequenced\u2014around 5% in the United States. Sequencing a viral genome, while necessary to discern unknown variants that arise, is costly and can take from two to three weeks. Adding to the complexity of sequencing, only about half of the positive samples have sufficiently detectible RNA for quality results and sequencing runs are performed in batches, sometimes delaying timely reporting of results. In summer 2021, when the Alpha variant was in decline and the Delta variant had emerged in the United States, NIH\u2019s RADx Tech program took on the challenge of assessing alternative methods for variant tracking that were faster and more efficient.\n\nIn a simulation with sample data from prior to September 2021, the RADx Tech VTF team worked closely with a bioinformatics research platform company, Rosalind, Inc of San Diego, to design a panel of markers both for detection of the virus \u2014 or positivity \u2014 and variant identification. They assigned three markers for determination of positivity and a combination of 45 others for identification of the then top 10 most prevalent variants according to the World Health Organization (WHO): Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, and Mu. The results of genotyping agreed with sequencing in at least 96% of positive-result samples and at least 99% of negative-result samples.\n\nSubsequently, they were able to reduce marker redundancy and condense the number of markers from 48 to 16, with nearly as effective performance for variant identification. With each reduction in markers built into the genotyping panel, the researchers could project a proportionate savings in cost and time. Upon the emergence of Omicron, the team further streamlined the panel to consist of only four markers to cover circulating variants (Delta and Omicron); a positive sample without a variant match could then be proposed for next-generation sequencing.\n\nNext, the team analyzed and monitored thousands of positive samples collected between November 2021 and January 2022, during emergence of the Omicron variant. Their analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples showed that the relative prevalence of the Omicron variant grew from approximately 40% in mid-December 2021 to greater than 90% at the end of the month, while Delta decreased from approximately 60% to less than 10% over the same period. By mid-January 2022, the prevalence of the Omicron variant further increased to greater than 95% and Delta dropped to less than 5%.\n\n\u201cThe genotyping platform is commonly available in thousands of clinical and research labs in the country,\u201d said Eric Lai, team leader with the RADx Tech VTF. \u201cPotentially, if this testing approach is further developed and authorized for clinical use, a hospital lab could order the reagent, validate the assays and perform genotyping on a single sample within a couple of hours to learn whether a person has COVID-19 and with which variant they are infected.\u201d He also noted that the faster turnaround, compared to next-generation sequencing, could help inform decisions, such as tailoring monoclonal antibody treatment.\n\nThe team contracted with Rosalind to develop a free, public dashboard that displays state-by-state the positivity rate and percentage of each variant in circulation, illustrating how genotyping and sequencing work hand in hand as part of the surveillance framework. This tracking tool\u2014the ROSALIND Tracker for COVID-19\u2014could become increasingly powerful as more public health and private testing labs adopt this genotyping approach and contribute their data to infectious disease authorities. Under contracts with NIH, testing laboratories at Aegis Sciences Corporation, Nashville; Helix, San Diego; and the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, have adopted the genotyping approach and are contributing data to the ROSALIND Tracker. NIH contracted with Thermo Fisher Scientific, South San Francisco, to supply instruments, consumables, reagents, software, and single-nucleotide polymorphism marker assays required to run the genotyping assay.\n\nSince the research reported in the paper was performed, the team has further developed the technology to identify subvariants of Omicron based on the recent variant landscape. Within weeks, genotyping panel markers were updated to distinguish between BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. \u201cThat adaptability and how fast we can reposition our markers is very important,\u201d said Lai.\n\n\u201cAll the materials that are associated with this genotyping assay are commercially available,\u201d said co-author Emily Kennedy, a RADx Tech program facilitator. \u201cLinks to those resources are provided in the paper so that we can share this information as a public health tool.\u201d\n\nThe project was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health (under award numbers 75N92022P00030, 75N92021P00116, U54EB015408, and U54EB027690) as part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx\u00ae) initiative, launched to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing.\n\nAbout the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx\u00ae) initiative: The RADx initiative was launched on April 29, 2020, to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing.

        "Here\u2019s what to do when someone at home has COVID-19",
        "I\u2019m one of 40 percent or fewer of Americans who have managed to avoid getting COVID-19. I have been avoiding it like a potentially life-threatening virus \u2014 I\u2019d say the plague, but all I really do to avoid that illness is not interact with rodents when I visit the West and Southwest. To protect against COVID-19, I wear KN95 masks when I\u2019m indoors in public or in crowded outdoor situations. I\u2019m up-to-date on vaccines with my second booster shot as of May, which may provide a tiny bit of protection against infection, but is mostly for keeping me from getting really sick if I were to get infected (SN: 4/29/22).\n\nAnd yet, I recently invited COVID-19 into my home. It came in the form of a relative who tested positive while vacationing here. She isolated herself in her hotel room until it was time to check out, but needed a place to stay until she was safe to fly home, according to this quarantine and isolation calculator from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nShe was still testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on at-home antigen tests when she came to us, so we assumed she was contagious to me and my husband. I made that assumption based on research and conversations with experts. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people infected with the omicron variant BA.1 produced infectious virus for about six to eight days on average, with some people shedding infectious virus for 10 days or longer.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know which of the omicron variants now circulating my relative had, but we did know that we didn\u2019t want to catch it. Omicron carries a higher chance of being passed on to household members than earlier variants of concern did, a recent JAMA Network Open study found. For instance, omicron had a secondary household attack rate of 42.7 percent, referring to the percentage of household members who got COVID-19 from an infected person in the house. That beats other highly infectious variants by a mile: Alpha\u2019s rate was 36.4 percent and delta\u2019s 29.7 percent. And the currently circulating subvariant of omicron, BA.5, may even reinfect people who recently had COVID-19 (SN: 6/27/22).\n\nSo how do you evade a virus that has been catching up with even those who have so far managed to avoid infection for years? A lot of people are probably asking that question right now, given that the CDC\u2019s community transmission map is red across the country (more than 93 percent of counties are reporting high community transmission), and my own personal gauge \u2014 Anna Gibbs\u2019 reporting on experts\u2019 advice on what to do after a positive COVID test \u2014 is consistently among Science News\u2019 most-read stories (SN: 4/22/22).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of different options, and you could do one or many of them, depending on your situation and how concerned you are about getting it,\u201d says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist who studies disease transmission at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.\n\nThe first option is to isolate the infected person from the rest of the household. For most people that probably involves putting someone in a room alone and closing the door. We did an admittedly extreme version of secluding our COVID-19 patient by putting up plastic sheeting to wall off our guest bedroom and guest bathroom as an isolation suite. Making things as airtight as possible may help limit the virus\u2019 spread in the house, Marr says. You don\u2019t need to erect a plastic wall like we did, though. Rolling up a towel and sticking it under the door may reduce the amount of air flowing in and out of an infected person\u2019s room. That is a tactic Marr says she uses when staying in hotel rooms.\n\nWe used plastic sheeting, a large zipper (sometimes used at construction projects to contain dust) and tape to make an isolation suite for a family member who got COVID-19. T.H. Saey\n\nIn our house, my relative went into the isolation suite and emerged only to retrieve meals I left for her on a tray just outside the zipper and to go for brief (masked) walks around the neighborhood.\n\nBut not everyone has such a high tolerance for solitude or has a housing situation that allows for a sick ward. And it\u2019s not really feasible to isolate children or household members that need care. Our isolation suite wouldn\u2019t have worked for Marr\u2019s 14-year-old son, she says. \u201cHe\u2019s very social. It would have been torture to make him stay in his room.\u201d\n\nNot to worry. Marr says there are plenty of ways to keep the virus away from uninfected family members. Good quality face coverings, such as N95, KN95 or KF94 masks, can help keep the virus in check (SN: 3/25/22). \u201cThe most important person to have wear a mask is the infected person because it acts as source control to keep the virus from getting out in the air,\u201d Marr says. Uninfected family members can wear masks as an extra layer of protection, too. My relative graciously wore her mask when outside of the isolation suite, and my husband and I masked and gloved up when we dropped off meals and retrieved dishes.\n\nBut Marr\u2019s son wasn\u2019t keen on wearing a mask, so her family took other measures. \u201cWe had a portable air cleaner and moved that around with him wherever he was. We did eat dinner together. We opened a window and had him sitting closest to the window with a fan pointing out, so that everything from him was getting sucked out.\u201d Their plan worked. Nobody else in Marr\u2019s household got COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIncreased ventilation, of course, is going to be very helpful,\u201d she says. That might involve opening windows when the weather allows and running the bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Pointing a fan out the open window in an infected person\u2019s room will also help limit the amount of virus reaching the rest of the household. Open windows aren\u2019t always welcome, especially when it\u2019s too cold or hot outside or during allergy season or when other conditions degrade air quality. For instance, \u201cthis assumes your outdoor air is not full of wildfire smoke,\u201d Marr says.\n\nFiltering the air can also reduce the amount of virus floating around the house. We put a portable air cleaner in the isolation suite. And we built a Corsi-Rosenthal box to filter any stray virus that wandered into our air space. The box is a do-it-yourself alternative to pricey HEPA filters. We built ours from four large air filters, a box fan and the cardboard box the fan came in (for the bottom of the box and a shroud for the top). Such boxes aren\u2019t HEPA filters, but they have a higher clean air delivery rate than many commercial machines because they move so much air, Marr says. Still, the box wasn\u2019t cheap to build. It cost about $130, with each filter costing just under $25.\n\nA Corsi-Rosenthal box, built with a box fan and air filters can suck the coronavirus, allergens and irritants out of the air. This is the one we built to filter out SARS-CoV-2 when an infected relative visited. T.H. Saey\n\n\u201cAll of these things you can do will reduce your risk by some amount, and the more you layer on top of each other, the more you reduce your risk,\u201d Marr says. Also important is to keep vulnerable people away from the infected person. Vulnerable people include the elderly, immunocompromised people or others with medical conditions that put them at high risk of severe disease.\n\nThe good news is that once the infection is over, the virus is probably gone. \u201cThe air doesn\u2019t typically stick around in a house, even when everything is closed up \u2026 for more than a few hours. It leaks in and out,\u201d Marr says. As for cleaning surfaces and laundry, there\u2019s no need to buy special products. \u201cRegular soap will easily kill the virus,\u201d she says.\n\nOur relative\u2019s positive line on at-home antigen tests grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared during her stay. Now, more than a week after her departure, my husband and I are still feeling fine and getting negative results on our at-home tests. It wasn\u2019t easy and it certainly wasn\u2019t fun (especially for my sequestered relative) to ward off the pestilence within our walls, but it\u2019s possible. If the coronavirus invades your home, I hope you\u2019ll be able to escape it, too.\n\nStay safe in there!"

        "What experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test",
        "After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 \u2014 including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of are-they-just-colds? scares and lots of negative tests \u2014 I recently tested positive.\n\nIt felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now \u201cit.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I still wore my mask inside public spaces (SN: 3/25/22). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold.\n\nTwo thick lines on my rapid test said otherwise (SN: 12/17/21). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what?\n\nThese are my results the day I tested positive for COVID-19. I took two rapid at-home tests just to be extra sure \u2014 and then got a PCR test from a testing site so my results could be included in official case counts. A. Gibbs\n\nI had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house.\n\nIt got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn\u2019t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought.\n\nWhen it comes to reporting at-home tests, \u201cthere is no formal recommendation,\u201d says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it\u2019s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic: Now that at-home tests are free and easy to access, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test.\n\nCases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn\u2019t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\u2019s data show that only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled \u201cCan we trust case numbers?\u201d\n\nTo make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test.\n\nBut until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we\u2019re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what\u2019s going on in your community, though.\n\nFor starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community monitors wastewater, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. Outbreaks Near Me, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nIn general, \u201cbe aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,\u201d Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: \u201cIf you start to hear, like, \u2018Hey, you know, I\u2019ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,\u2019 that\u2019s probably a really good indicator \u2026 that there\u2019s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.\u201d And that it\u2019s a good time to start taking extra precautions again.\n\nSpeaking of precautions, according to the isolation guidelines put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can still be contagious after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s a complicated question. There\u2019s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator \u2014 albeit imperfect \u2014 of current contagiousness. (That\u2019s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.)\n\nHow contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC\u2019s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days.\n\nBut several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms, about half of the players still showed significant viral load. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that 43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,\u201d Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. \u201cI would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,\u201d Mina says. \u201cThat was based on old data.\u201d\n\nInstead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you\u2019re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there\u2019s likely less virus in your body.\n\nBut because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, \u201cyou should assume that you\u2019re infectious\u201d if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you\u2019ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative.\n\nBy my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be.\n\nI wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it\u2019s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, not enough knowledge to make such decisions (SN: 6/16/21).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to be confused about all this,\u201d Mina says. \u201cI think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.\u201d Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds.\n\nAs for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina\u2019s advice on testing negative twice, I\u2019m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now."

        "It sounds like the setup for a joke: If radio waves give you radar and sound gives you sonar, what do gravitational waves get you?\n\nThe answer might be \u201cGRADAR\u201d \u2014 gravitational wave \u201cradar\u201d \u2014 a potential future technology that could use reflections of gravitational waves to map the unseen universe, say researchers in a paper accepted to Physical Review Letters. By looking for these signals, scientists may be able to find dark matter or dim, exotic stars and learn about their deep insides.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nAstronomers routinely use gravitational waves \u2014 traveling ripples in the fabric of space and time itself, first detected in 2015 \u2014 to watch cataclysmic events that are hard to study with light alone, such as the merging of two black holes (SN: 2/11/2016).\n\nBut physicists have also known about a seemingly useless property of gravitational waves: They can change course. Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity says that spacetime gets warped by matter, and any wave passing through these distortions will change course. The upshot is that when something emits gravitational waves, part of the signal comes straight at Earth, but some might arrive later \u2014 like an echo \u2014 after taking longer paths that bend around a star or anything else heavy.\n\nScientists have always thought these later signals, called \u201cgravitational glints,\u201d should be too weak to detect. But physicists Craig Copi and Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, took a leap: Working off Einstein\u2019s theory, they calculated how strong the signal would be when waves scatter through the gravitational field inside a star itself.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing is that you seem to get a much larger result than you would have expected,\u201d Copi says. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re still trying to understand, where that comes from \u2014 whether it\u2019s believable, even, because it just seems too good to be true.\u201d\n\nIf gravitational glints can be so strong, astronomers could possibly use them to trace the insides of stars, the team says. Researchers could even look for massive bodies in space that would otherwise be impossible to detect, like globs of dark matter or lone neutron stars on the other side of the observable universe.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be a very exciting probe,\u201d says Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThere are still reasons to be cautious, though. If this phenomenon stands up to more detailed scrutiny, Fishbach says, scientists would have to understand it better before they could use it \u2014 and that will probably be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard calculation,\u201d Copi says.\n\nBut similar challenges have been overcome before. \u201cThe whole story of gravitational wave detection has been like that,\u201d Fishbach says. It was a struggle to do all the math needed to understand their measurements, she says, but now the field is taking off (SN: 1/21/21). \u201cThis is the time to really be creative with gravitational waves.\u201d"

        "Trained dogs sniff out COVID-19 as well as lab tests do",
        "Dogs are as reliable as laboratory tests for detecting COVID-19 cases, and may be even better than PCR tests for identifying infected people who don\u2019t have symptoms. A bonus: The canines are cuter and less invasive than a swab up the nose.\n\nIn a study involving sweat samples from 335 people, trained dogs sniffed out 97 percent of the coronavirus cases that had been identified by PCR tests, researchers report June 1 in PLOS One. And the dogs found all 31 COVID-19 cases among 192 people who didn\u2019t have symptoms.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nThese findings are evidence that dogs could be effective for mass screening efforts at places such as airports or concerts and may provide friendly alternatives for testing people who balk at nasal swabs, says Dominique Grandjean, a veterinarian at the National School of Veterinary Medicine of Alfort in Maisons-Alfort, France.\n\n\u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d but there are many ways PCR tests can go wrong, Grandjean says. The canines\u2019 noses also identified more COVID-19 cases than did antigen tests (SN: 12/17/21), similar to many at-home tests, but sometimes mistook another respiratory virus for the coronavirus, Grandjean and colleagues found. What\u2019s more, anecdotal evidence suggests the dogs can pick up asymptomatic cases as much as 48 hours before people test positive by PCR, he says.\n\nIn the study, dogs from French fire stations and from the Ministry of the Interior of the United Arab Emirates were trained in coronavirus detection by rewarding them with toys \u2014 usually tennis balls. \u201cIt\u2019s playtime for them,\u201d Grandjean says. It takes about three to six weeks, depending on the dog\u2019s experience with odor detection, to train a dog to pick out COVID-19 cases from sweat samples.\n\nThe dogs then sniffed cones housing sweat samples collected from human volunteers\u2019 underarms. Swabbing the sweat off the back of people\u2019s necks or giving the woofers a whiff of used face masks worked just as well, Grandjean says.\n\nThose results indicate that odors from multiple body sites can be used for canine screening, says Kenneth Furton, a forensic chemist at Florida International University in Miami who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe results are similar to previous, smaller studies that also found that dogs perform as well as or even better than PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Furton says. He and colleagues have used dogs at schools, a music festival and in a small trial screening airline employees for coronavirus infections.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages dogs have over other tests is their speed, Furton says. \u201cEven with what we call a rapid test, you\u2019re still going to have to wait tens of minutes or even hours, where the dog in a matter of seconds or even fractions of seconds can make a response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what dogs are smelling when they detect COVID-19 or other diseases, says Cynthia Otto, director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s working dog center, who was not involved in the study. It may not be a single chemical, but rather a pattern of increasing and decreasing levels of certain aromas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you could create an odor perfume bottle that would be the scent of COVID,\u201d she says.\n\nEven with repeated studies demonstrating dogs\u2019 COVID-detection prowess, some doctors, scientists and government officials have been skeptical of the claims, Grandjean says. He finds the reluctance puzzling, because dogs are already used to sniff out drugs and explosives, and are being tested for detecting other diseases, such as cancer, he says. \u201cEvery time you take a plane, it\u2019s because dogs have been sniffing your luggage [and found] no explosives. So you trust them when you take a plane, but you don\u2019t want to trust them for COVID?\u201d\n\nOne challenge with dogs, says Furton, is that people don\u2019t think of them as high-tech the way electronic sensors are. \u201cBut dogs are one of the highest-tech devices we have. They\u2019re just biological sensors, instead of electronic sensors,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother drawback for dogs is that they take time to train and there currently aren\u2019t even enough dogs trained to detect explosives, let alone diseases, Otto says. And \u201cdogs that work well in that lab setting may not work well in a people setting,\u201d she says. Handlers can also influence the dog\u2019s response and must be able to read the dog well, she says. \u201cWe need more good dogs.\u201d"

        "Here are experts\u2019 answers to questions about COVID-19 vaccines for little kids",
        "Four weeks ago, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on COVID-19 vaccines for young children. Days later, doctors\u2019 offices and clinics began rolling out shots for babies and toddlers.\n\nIn Portland, Ore., a clinic featuring bubbles, toys and a dance party delivered more than 1,100 shots in two days. In Arizona, more than 2,000 kids under 5 have received their first dose in about three weeks. Over the same time period in Fayetteville, Ga., one practice has given out roughly 100 doses to young kids.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nAs of July 14, nearly 400,000 kids under 5 have received at least one dose, the CDC reports. That\u2019s about 2 percent of eligible children in this age group.\n\nPediatrician Eliza Hayes Bakken has seen an initial rush of parents who signed up for appointments as soon as the vaccines became available. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge push of families that want to be in that first group that\u2019s vaccinated,\u201d says Bakken, who treats kids at Oregon Health & Sciences University Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. She suspects demand will soon taper off, following a pattern pediatricians have seen with vaccinations in older age groups.\n\nGetting young kids vaccinated may be a long, slow haul, says Adrianne Hammershaimb, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. About half of U.S. parents with children under 4 said they were likely to get their kids the shot, her team reported last month in the Journal of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases Society. That number is \u201clower than we\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d she says.\n\nOnly about 55 percent of U.S. adults surveyed say COVID-19 vaccination has been extremely or very effective at limiting the coronavirus\u2019 spread, the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., reported on July 7. In Hammershaimb\u2019s experience, the issue isn\u2019t that most parents are anti-vaxxers or mistrust all vaccines. Rather, \u201cparents are genuinely concerned about the unknown,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there, she notes, and people are trying to figure out what\u2019s best for their kids.\n\nAs BA.5 continues to spark cases (now accounting for some 65 percent of new infections in the United States), parents are talking to doctors about COVID-19 risks, vaccine safety and vaccination timing. Here, Hammershaimb and three other pediatricians answer some common questions they\u2019ve been getting.\n\nIs COVID-19 really a problem for kids?\n\n\u201cThis is one big question we get a lot,\u201d Hammershaimb says. Kids are just as likely to catch COVID-19 as adults, though cases tend to be milder. Half of kids infected may have no symptoms at all.\n\nThe disease also tends to be deadlier for adults than children. In people ages 55 and older, COVID-19 is the third leading cause of death in the United States, scientists reported July 5 in JAMA Internal Medicine. But COVID-19 can hit kids hard, too. It ranks as the eighth leading cause of death in people 19 and under in the United States.\n\n\u201cYou hear on TV that COVID is not a big deal for kids,\u201d says Sara Goza, a pediatrician in Fayetteville, Ga., who served as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit shocking.\u201d In her practice, she\u2019s seen infected children develop long COVID and chronic fatigue. \u201cThis disease is not without its complications,\u201d she says.\n\nBakken\u2019s 9-year-old son caught COVID-19 in 2020, before the vaccine came out. His case wasn\u2019t particularly serious, but he did have long-term effects. He had to take more medication to control his asthma and be extra cautious playing sports. That may seem minor, Bakken says, but it didn\u2019t feel that way for her son. \u201cIt affected his daily life.\u201d\n\nWhat are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nParents taking their young kids to get the shot can expect to see side effects similar to those common in other childhood vaccines. Fatigue, fussiness, redness at the injection site \u200b\u200b\u2014 those are signs the body is responding to the vaccine like it\u2019s supposed to, Bakken says. Some kids may have no side effects, and that\u2019s OK, too, she says.\n\nVaccine safety is another topic parents have questioned (something that also came up in a recent Science News Twitter poll). Clinical trials and real-world data suggest the vaccines are safe for kids and adults, Bakken says. \u201cAdverse events are exceedingly rare \u2014 much more rare than complications from COVID itself.\u201d\n\nIn the last 2.5 years, our reporters have written hundreds of stories about the coronavirus, its health risks and the latest vaccine news. Now we want to hear from you. What COVID-19 issues do you want to know more about? \u2014 Science News (@ScienceNews) June 30, 2022\n\nTake myocarditis, the rare heart inflammation condition sometimes seen after getting Pfizer\u2019s or Moderna\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In boys between the ages of 12 and 17, myocarditis crops up in roughly 1 out of 10,000 following vaccination, scientists reported July 13 in the BMJ.\n\nBut teen boys are up to six times more likely to experience heart complications after COVID-19 infection compared with after vaccination, CDC scientists reported in April. In younger boys, ages 5 to 11, heart complications following vaccination are even more rare. And in most people with myocarditis following vaccination, symptoms improve quickly and the heart fully recovers.\n\nHammershaimb is keeping an eye on CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration monitoring systems that track potential adverse events to the vaccine. If anything concerning comes up, she says, \u201dwe can intervene, halt the vaccination program, and take a close look at any cases that are reported.\u201d Ultimately, she says, parents need to weigh the hypothetical risk of a rare adverse reaction against the known risks of COVID-19 infection.\n\nShould parents wait until the fall to vaccinate their kids?\n\nNo, Hammershaimb says. She encourages parents to sign their kids up for their shots this summer, so they\u2019ll head into fall with some coronavirus protection already built up. It\u2019s possible that COVID-19 boosters targeting the omicron variant may be available as the school year kicks off, but that doesn\u2019t mean parents should wait, she says. \u201cWe want kids to be as protected as they can be when they go back to the classroom.\u201d\n\nSophie Katz, a pediatric infectious disease doctor in Nashville, agrees. Though the current vaccines\u2019 ability to prevent omicron infection in kids seems to wane rapidly, the shots continue to be effective against hospitalization, she wrote in a JAMA editorial in May. And a study of kids in Israel who had received the Pfizer vaccine found that two doses offered moderate protection against the original omicron variant, scientists reported in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 29.\n\nKatz\u2019s 13-month-old baby has already had COVID-19, but she says, \u201cI am 100 percent going to get her vaccinated.\u201d For Katz, it\u2019s a matter of protecting her child from severe disease. \u201cI will do anything to keep my daughter out of the hospital.\u201d"

I\u2019ve been overwhelmed with despair over the death and suffering. I\u2019ve been numb, trying to keep up with the deluge of COVID-19 studies. One balm has been the understanding of colleagues who also report on COVID-19.\n\nI found solace too in Virology, microbiologist Joseph Osmundson\u2019s book of 11 wide-ranging essays, in which he writes of the pandemic and calls for \u201ca new rhetoric of care.\u201d Osmundson includes journal entries from the pandemic, and some of his experi\u00adences are similar to mine. He dreams he\u2019s at a gathering where no one is masked.

He jumps from other viruses and the immune system to illness and metaphors for illness, to sex and HIV, to archiving history and whose stories get told.

They just are,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe meaning we give a virus affects how we live with it.\u201d When we describe viruses as enemies and illness as a war, it \u201cassumes the necessity of casualties.\u201d He argues instead to focus resources on caring for one another.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, Osmundson, a gay man, is acutely aware of the messages that come with viruses. \u201cOur generation of gay men came after the plague,\u201d he writes. \u201cHIV didn\u2019t just kill bodies. It killed a type of sex as well, a type of pleasure.\u201d But new therapies have saved lives and altered perceptions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can prevent infection, while treatment can render HIV untransmissible (SN: 11/15/19). These advances changed our relationship with the virus, Osmundson writes. \u201cI used to think that HIV would make it harder to find love and sex. Now we know that HIV-positive and undetectable is safe. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d\n\nBut the biomedicine that can change our relationship with viruses has not been wielded equitably, Osmundson observes.

        "What Is the Difference Between Influenza and COVID-19?",
        "While every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies. Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions.\n\nCourtesy, NIAID\n\nInfluenza and the coronavirus disease COVID-19 appear to be very similar. After all, both are respiratory diseases, and they are transmitted via contact with infectious respiratory droplets. Beyond that, however, they differ in important ways. What are some of these differences, and why do they matter?\n\nContagiousness\n\nOne difference between COVID-19 and influenza is that the former appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. A person infected with influenza spreads the disease to another 1.3 individuals. For COVID-19, an infected person spreads illness to another 2 to 2.5 persons.\n\nSeverity of illness and death rate\n\nCOVID-19 also appears to cause more severe illness more frequently than seasonal influenza. Part of this difference may be attributed to the fact that COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus, against which humans have no immunity. By contrast, many people have at least some degree of immunity against seasonal influenza, enough to prevent hospitalization and complications in most instances.\n\nAlong those same lines, COVID-19 is deadlier than influenza. The mortality rate of influenza is roughly 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be about 1.4-4.5 percent, with risk of death being significantly higher for older persons than for younger individuals.\n\nSeasonal nature\n\nSeasonal influenza, as its name suggests, tends to come and go as the weather changes. Influenza viruses circulate year-round, but the number of new influenza cases generally increases in the cooler months and tapers off in the warmer months of the year. This does not mean that cold weather causes the flu; rather, cool weather, by bringing people indoors, along with other changes, is a contributing factor.\n\nIt is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away. COVID-19 is a new disease, and there are many millions of people worldwide who have not yet been exposed. This deep reserve of potential hosts could fuel sustained transmission through summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Many factors, however, determine seasonality of diseases, and more time is needed before conclusions can be drawn about whether COVID-19 is a seasonal illness.\n\nCausative agent\n\nA more obvious difference between influenza and COVID-19 is in their causative agents. Influenza viruses belong to a virus family known as Orthomyxoviridae. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which is classified in the family Coronaviridae. Both families consist of RNA viruses, but they differ particularly with regard to the protein layer that encapsulates the RNA.\n\nMore specifically, influenza viruses express two surface antigens (foreign proteins)\u2014hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)\u2014which trigger an immune response. The exact form of these antigens changes every now and then, resulting in the periodic emergence of new, more virulent influenza viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic. The surface of SARS-CoV-2 does not have these antigens. Rather, similar to other types of coronaviruses, its outer surface is studded with glycoprotein spikes, which give such viruses a crownlike, or coronal, appearance. Spike glycoproteins are responsible for triggering the immune response, and they carry out the critical function of enabling the coronavirus particle to enter cells, where it then replicates."

        "COVID-19 pandemic fuels largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades - PAHO/WHO",
        "WHO and UNICEF sound the alarm as new data shows global vaccination coverage continued to decline in 2021, with 25 million infants missing out on lifesaving vaccines. In the Americas, last year alone more than 2.6 million children were unvaccinated or not fully up to date on their immunizations.\n\nGeneva/New York, 15 July 2022- The largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years has been recorded in official data published today by WHO and UNICEF.\n\nThe percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) \u2013 a marker for immunization coverage within and across countries \u2013 fell 5 percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81 per cent.\n\nAs a result, 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP through routine immunization services in 2021 alone. This is 2 million more than those who missed out in 2020 and 6 million more than in 2019, highlighting the growing number of children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases. The decline was due to many factors including an increased number of children living in conflict and fragile settings where immunization access is often challenging, increased misinformation and COVID-19 related issues such as service and supply chain disruptions, resource diversion to response efforts, and containment measures that limited immunization service access and availability.\n\n\u201cThis is a red alert for child health. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,\u201d said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. \u201cWhile a pandemic hangover was expected last year as a result of COVID-19 disruptions and lockdowns, what we are seeing now is a continued decline. COVID-19 is not an excuse. We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems.\u201d\n\n18 million of the 25 million children did not receive a single dose of DTP during the year, the vast majority of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, with India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia and the Philippines recording the highest numbers. Among countries with the largest relative increases in the number of children who did not receive a single vaccine between 2019 and 2021 are Myanmar and Mozambique.\n\nGlobally, over a quarter of the coverage of HPV vaccines that was achieved in 2019 has been lost. This has grave consequences for the health of women and girls, as global coverage of the first dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is only 15%, despite the first vaccines being licensed over 15 years ago.\n\nIn the Americas, vaccination rates against polio, measles, rubella, diphtheria and other vaccine preventable diseases had been decreasing for the past ten years, and this trend was exacerbated by the pandemic. In 2021, more than 2.6 million children were unvaccinated or not fully up to date with their immunizations, making them susceptible to diseases such as polio, tetanus and diphtheria. Regional coverage for the third dose of DTP fell from 91% in 2016 to 80% in 2021, and coverage for the first dose against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR1) dropped to 83% - an eight per cent decrease since 2016.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has been working with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to strengthen routine immunizations programs and catch-up campaigns. PAHO is also supporting countries in surveillance to detect emerging outbreaks and ensure a timely response to avoid further transmission of vaccine preventable diseases.\n\nPAHO recommends that countries strengthen the infrastructure of national immunization programs, taking advantage of investments made during the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. Continuous improvement to vaccine cold chain operations, public communication efforts and the overall operation of health services are key to bring all children up to date on vaccines.\n\n\u201cPlanning and tackling COVID-19 should also go hand-in-hand with vaccinating for killer diseases like measles, pneumonia and diarrhea,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of either/or, it\u2019s possible to do both\u201d.\n\nMonumental efforts will be required to reach universal levels of coverage and to prevent outbreaks. Inadequate coverage levels have already resulted in avoidable outbreaks of measles and polio in the past 12 months, underscoring the vital role of immunization in keeping children, adolescents, adults, and societies healthy.\n\nThe sharp two-year decline follows almost a decade of stalled progress, underscoring the need to not only address pandemic-related disruptions but also systemic immunization challenges to ensure every child and adolescent is reached.\n\nWHO and UNICEF are working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other partners to deliver the global Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), a strategy for all countries and relevant global partners to achieve set goals on preventing diseases through immunization and delivering vaccines to everyone, everywhere, at every age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heart-breaking to see more children losing out on protection from preventable diseases for a second year in a row. The priority of the Alliance must be to help countries to maintain, restore and strengthen routine immunization alongside executing ambitious COVID-19 vaccination plans, not just through vaccines but also tailored structural support for the health systems that will administer them,\u201d said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\nNotes for editors:\n\nAccess the UNICEF dataset (data will be updated to reflect the new WUENIC release once embargo lifts): Overview page, Full datasets, Data visualisation, Country profiles\n\nAccess the WHO dataset (data will be updated to reflect the new WUENIC release once embargo lifts): Global dashboard, Full datasets, information page\n\nDownload content: photo gallery and social media content, immunization page, coverage fact sheet and WUENIC Q&A, UNICEF multimedia and immunization page\n\nRead the Guiding Principles for recovering, building resiliency, and strengthening of immunization in 2022 and beyond here\n\nAbout the data\n\nBased on country-reported data, the official WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC) provide the world\u2019s largest and most comprehensive data-set on immunization trends for vaccinations against 13 diseases given through regular health systems - normally at clinics, community centres, outreach services, or health worker visits. For 2021, data were provided from 177 countries."

        "With Omicron variant sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 driving most new COVID-19 infections, and other diseases likely to emerge in the future, increased medical production is key to saving lives, PAHO Director says.\n\nWashington D.C. 13 July 2022 (PAHO) \u2013 As Omicron sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 drive a new wave of COVID-19 infections across the Americas, and cases of monkeypox continue to rise, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director Carissa F. Etienne has called on countries to work together to meet the growing demand for vaccines, medicines, and other health equipment in the region.\n\nThe emergence of Omicron sublineages is \u201cyet another reminder that the virus keeps evolving every time it is transmitted, and that we must remain vigilant,\u201d the Director said during a media briefing today.\n\n\u201cManufacturing capacity will continue to be sorely needed in our Region to help deal with COVID-19 and other pathogens. There are likely to be outbreaks of other diseases that will require us to rapidly develop and deploy new vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs to fight them,\u201d she added.\n\nDr. Etienne highlighted that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the region struggled to meet the growing demand for drugs, diagnostics, and personal protective equipment, with many countries relying on imports to protect their populations. When COVID-19 vaccines were first rolled out COVID-19 vaccines, countries also scrambled \u201cto secure supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must be better prepared for the future,\u201d the Director said, announcing a three-step plan to work with countries and international donors to bolster regional capacity to manufacture vaccines and medical tools.\n\nThe first phase will focus on efforts to strengthen research and development in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly in the area of mRNA vaccine development.\n\nThe Regional Platform to Advance Manufacturing of COVID-19 Vaccines and other Health Technologies, launched last year, aims to train and support local companies in utilizing mRNA vaccine technology. So far, Sinergium Biotech from Argentina and the Institute of Immunobiology Bio-Manguinhos from Brazil are participating in this initiative.\n\nThe second phase focuses on developing a strong regional regulatory system to ensure that new medical tools are safe and effective.\n\nFor the third phase, PAHO is working with regional and international partners to create a shared roadmap to improve the production of health technology in the Americas, including partnerships with the European Union to strengthen the region\u2019s capacity for medical product development.\n\n\u201cAll these efforts combined have the potential to transform how our region develops and manufactures health products, especially highly sophisticated tools such as vaccines,\u201d the Director said.\n\nHowever, Dr. Etienne also warned that improving manufacturing capacity alone \u201cis not sufficient to guarantee access,\u201d and that PAHO\u2019s pooled procurement mechanisms such as the Revolving Fund will be key to ensuring that vaccines and other health technologies are available to everyone in the region.\n\nThe Revolving Fund shows the \u201cimpact we can have when we leverage our history of solidarity and collaboration,\u201d the Director said. With this same spirit, we can build up our region\u2019s medical production capacity to \u201csave and protect even more lives.\u201d\n\nTurning to the COVID-19 situation in the region, countries reported approximately 1.6 million cases and 4800 deaths last week \u2013 a 0.9% and 3.5% decrease respectively.\n\nCentral America reported an increase in cases - by 54.9%, and South America reported a 2% increase.\n\nIn the Caribbean, cases fell by 5.2%, and in North America, cases fell by 4.5%"

        "Statement on the twelfth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic - PAHO/WHO",
        "July 12, 2022 \u2014 The WHO Director-General has the pleasure of transmitting the Report of the twelfth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, held on Friday, 8 July 2022, from 12:00 to 15:30 CEST.\n\nThe WHO Director-General concurs with the advice offered by the Committee regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and determines that the event continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nThe WHO Director-General considered the advice provided by the Committee regarding the proposed Temporary Recommendations. The set of Temporary Recommendations issued by the WHO Director-General is presented at the end of this statement.\n\nThe WHO Director-General is taking the opportunity to express his sincere gratitude to the Chair, and Members of the Committee, as well as to its Advisors.\n\n===\n\nProceedings of the meeting\n\nOn behalf of the WHO Director-General, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Michael J. Ryan, welcomed Members and Advisors of the Emergency Committee, all of whom were convened by videoconference.\n\nDr Ryan expressed concern regarding the current global COVID-19 epidemiological situation. Cases of COVID-19 reported to WHO had increased by 30% in the last two weeks, largely driven by Omicron BA.4, BA.5 and other descendent lineages and the lifting of public health and social measures (PHSM). This increase in cases was translating into pressure on health systems in a number of WHO regions. Dr Ryan highlighted additional challenges to the ongoing COVID-19 response: recent changes in testing policies that hinder the detection of cases and the monitoring of virus evolution; inequities in access to testing, sequencing, vaccines and therapeutics, including new antivirals; waning of natural and vaccine-derived protection; and the global burden of Post COVID-19 condition.\n\nThe Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics briefed Members and Advisers on their roles and responsibilities. Members and Advisors were also reminded of their duty of confidentiality as to the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee, as well as their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or direct conflict of interest. Each Member and Advisor who was present was surveyed. No conflicts of interest were identified.\n\nThe Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and the mandate of the Emergency Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR.\n\nThe meeting was handed over to the Chair of the Emergency Committee regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Professor Didier Houssin. The Chair introduced the objectives of the meeting: to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a PHEIC, and to review temporary recommendations to States Parties.\n\nThe WHO Secretariat presented a global overview of current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted a number of challenges to the ongoing response. The presentation focused on: the global COVID-19 epidemiological situation; the evolution of the virus and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern; an update on international travel-related measures; the current status of COVID-19 vaccination and progress towards WHO vaccination targets; and the 2022 WHO Strategic preparedness, readiness and response plan.\n\nDeliberative session\n\nThe Committee discussed the following issues: the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus evolution on the public health response and capacities of health services; progress towards increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage; changes in testing and surveillance strategies; societal and political risk perception and community engagement; equity and access to countermeasures, vaccines and therapeutics; and maintaining political engagement while balancing the need to respond to other public health priorities and emergencies. The Committee discussed that SARS-CoV-2 virus had not yet established its ecological niche and that the implications of a pandemic caused by a novel respiratory virus may not be fully understood. Consequently, given the current shape and unpredictable dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee emphasized the need to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This requires the responsible, consistent, and continued use of individual-level protective measures, to the benefit of communities as a whole; as well as the continued adjustments of community-wide PHSM, to overcome the \u201call or nothing\u201d binary approaches.\n\nThe Committee expressed concern as to the ongoing changes observed in States Parties with respect to steep reductions in testing, resulting in reduced coverage and quality of surveillance as fewer cases are being detected and reported to WHO; and fewer genomic sequences being submitted to open access platforms \u2013 resulting in a lack of representativeness of genomic sequences from all WHO regions. This impedes assessments of currently circulating and emerging variants of the virus, including the generation and analysis of phenotypic data. The above is translating into the increasing inability to interpret trends in transmission, and consequently to properly inform the adjustments of PHSM.\n\nThe epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection remains unpredictable as the virus continues to evolve, through sustained transmission in the human population and in domestic, farmed, and wild animals in which the virus was newly introduced.\n\nThe Committee noted that both the trajectory of viral evolution and the characteristics of emerging variants of the virus remain uncertain and unpredictable, and, in the absence of the adoption of PHSM aiming at reducing transmission, the resulting selective pressure on the virus increases the probability of new, fitter variants emerging, with different degrees of virulence, transmissibility, and immune escape potential.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee highlighted the need for all States Parties to continue to apply PHSM proportionate to their epidemiological situation, stressing the continued use of effective, individual-level protective measures to reduce transmission. The Committee acknowledged the ongoing challenges faced by States Parties in adjusting and implementing PHSM. The Committee acknowledged WHO\u2019s advice to States Parties to regularly assess the epidemiological situation at sub-national levels and adjust PHSM proportionately. PHSM should be adjusted based on estimates of disease prevalence and population protection from infection and vaccination, as well as the capacities of the local health system (already challenged, inter alia, by staff shortages due to COVID-19 related burn-out).\n\nThe Committee highlighted the need to improve surveillance, by broadening and developing an array of approaches and tools aiming at achieving global situational population- based and geographic representativeness. These include, but are not limited to, the integration of self-testing results and sentinel surveillance approaches into national and global surveillance schemes, and aggregate sampling strategies with Nucleic Acid Amplification Test-based tools and detailed deep genome sequence probing. Novel surveillance approaches would enhance better assessment of trends in epidemiology of infection, disease, and viral evolution, as well as trends in health system capacity, and support agility and timely adjustments of PHSM. The Committee acknowledged the need to expedite integration of COVID-19 surveillance into routine systems, for instance by integrating COVID-19 surveillance with the surveillance of other respiratory pathogens; and recognized the potential value of supplementing surveillance with wastewater surveillance. In addition, access to timely and accurate testing, with linkage to clinical care and therapeutics, needs to be maintained.\n\nThe Committee recognised the continued work of WHO and partners in increasing vaccination coverage in all six WHO regions, with focus in achieving the highest possible vaccination coverage among persons at highest risk of severe disease outcomes and among persons at highest risk of exposure; as well as assessing and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. However, given the persistent vaccine inequities, the Committee reinforced the need for ensuring that the highest priority groups are vaccinated in every country, with a primary series and booster dose, in accordance with WHO global vaccination strategy and the updated WHO SAGE Roadmap for prioritizing uses of COVID-19 vaccines. The Committee expressed concern over the lack of data shared with WHO on vaccination coverage in the high priority groups for 30% of the countries. The Committee acknowledged the disruption the pandemic continues to have on routine immunization activities, which is resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in areas of low coverage.\n\nThe Committee highlighted that immediate efforts are warranted to promote access for Low and Middle Income Countries to therapeutics that reduce disease severity in both ambulant and hospitalised patients. The Committee warned that the lack of equitable access that occurred with vaccines should not be repeated with therapeutics. The Committee also highlighted the continued need for further research and development for COVID-19 in the areas of epidemiology and variants, diagnostics, clinical care including care for Post COVID-19 condition, and additional COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGiven the general public\u2019s perception that the pandemic may be over, the Committee also highlighted the ongoing challenges in communicating, particularly to communities that continue to experience high levels of transmission, that the mitigation of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in the immediate and longer terms, depends on the use of PHSM. The Committee emphasised the importance of using learning from the last two and a half years to nuance the implementation of PHSM in individual communities. The Committee acknowledged that any risk communication and community engagement effort should hinge on consistent and synchronized political will, policies, and a concert of community influencers to shift the course of risk perception.\n\nStatus of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern\n\nThe Committee recognized an overall decoupling of incident cases from severe disease, deaths, and pressure on health systems in the context of increased population immunity.\n\nHowever, the Committee unanimously agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic still meets the criteria of an extraordinary event that continues to adversely impact the health of the world\u2019s population, and that the emergence and international spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants may present an even greater health impact.\n\nThe Committee explicitly indicated the following reasons underpinning their advice to the WHO Director-General as to the event continuing to constitute a PHEIC.\n\nFirstly, the recent increase in the growth rate of cases in many States Parties in different WHO regions.\n\nSecondly, the continuing and substantial evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which, while inherent to all viruses, is expected to continue in an unpredictable manner. Yet the ability to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, or countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, is becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the inadequacy of current surveillance, including the reductions in testing and genomic sequencing. Additionally, there are uncertainties surrounding the level of readiness of already overburdened health systems, across all WHO regions, to respond to future COVID-19 pandemic waves.\n\nThirdly, public health and health planning tools to reduce transmission and disease burden (including hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care units of severe cases, and the impact of post COVID-19 condition) are not being implemented in proportion to local transmission levels or health system capacities.\n\nFinally, there are inadequacies in risk communication and community engagement related to the need for the implementation or adjustment of PHSM, as well as a disconnect in the perception of risk posed by COVID-19 between scientific communities, political leaders and the general public.\n\nFor these reasons, continued coordination of the international response is necessary to reconsider approaches allowing for the accurate and reliable monitoring of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and triggering of adjustments to PHSM. Coordination is also still necessary to intensify and sustain development and research efforts related to effective and equitably available countermeasures and to develop further risk communication and community engagement approaches.\n\nThe Committee considered the Temporary Recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat and provided its advice.\n\n===\n\nTemporary Recommendations issued by the WHO Director-General to all States Parties"

        "People who had COVID reported a wider range of post-infection symptoms to their primary care physicians than expected, a retrospective matched cohort study in the U.K. showed.\n\nOverall, 62 symptoms were significantly associated with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks, reported Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar, MBBS, MPH, of University of Birmingham in England, and colleagues.\n\nSymptoms with the largest adjusted HRs were anosmia (HR 6.49), hair loss (HR 3.99), sneezing (HR 2.77), ejaculation difficulty (HR 2.63), reduced libido (HR 2.36), shortness of breath at rest (HR 2.20), fatigue (HR 1.92), pleuritic chest pain (HR 1.86), hoarse voice (HR 1.78), and fever (HR 1.75), they wrote in Nature Medicine.\n\nTwenty of the 62 reported symptoms were among the 33 symptoms listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition of long COVID. Overall, 5.4% of people with COVID and 4.3% of people without COVID reported at least one symptom included in the WHO case definition.\n\nOverarching definitions like the WHO's and the CDC's are commonly used, but some experts have cautioned against rushing to define long COVID. While persistent post-infection problems like fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction have a significant effect on people's lives, long COVID symptoms are more extensive than this, Nirantharakumar's group noted.\n\n\"This research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of long COVID are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions,\" co-author Shamil Haroon, PhD, MPH, also of University of Birmingham, said in a statement.\n\n\"The symptoms we identified should help clinicians and clinical guideline developers to improve the assessment of patients with long-term effects from COVID-19, and to subsequently consider how this symptom burden can be best managed,\" he added.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 486,149 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from January 2020 to April 2021 who were not hospitalized with infection, and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in U.K primary care records. They assessed relative differences in 115 symptoms 12 weeks after people in the COVID group were infected.\n\nMean age of participants was 43.8 and 55.3% were female. Most (64.7%) were white, while 12.2% were Asian, and 4.0% were Black Afro-Caribbean. In total, 53.8% were overweight or obese and 22.5% were current smokers.\n\nWomen had an increased risk of long COVID symptoms than men (adjusted HR 1.52). In univariate analyses, ages over 30 were associated with a higher risk of long COVID symptoms, but after adjusting for baseline covariates, people ages 30-39 had a 6% lower risk and people ages 70 and older had a 25% lower risk than those ages 18-30 years.\n\nOther risk factors included being part of an ethnic minority group, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and a wide range of comorbidities.\n\nThe researchers identified three clusters of long COVID phenotypes based on their data: people with a broad spectrum of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and rash (80.0%); people with mainly respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and phlegm (5.8%); and people with predominantly mental health and cognitive symptoms, including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and brain fog (14.2%).\n\nA key study limitation was its use of routinely coded healthcare information. Primary care records may not reflect the true symptom burden of long COVID, which may be underestimated or overestimated in this data set, the researchers acknowledged.\n\n\"The symptom data we used for the study thus cannot be used to make inferences about the absolute prevalence of these symptoms,\" Nirantharakumar and colleagues cautioned.\n\nJudy George covers neurology and neuroscience news for MedPage Today, writing about brain aging, Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, MS, rare diseases, epilepsy, autism, headache, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s, ALS, concussion, CTE, sleep, pain, and more.

        "More Data Needed to Determine COVID-Diabetes Link in Kids",
        "The incidence of diabetes among children was slightly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately not significantly different than expected rates, according to a cross-sectional study from Canada.\n\nAmong over 2 million kids, the relative rate of new diabetes presentations was 15% to 32% lower in March to May 2020, and 33% to 50% higher in February to July 2021, though overall there was no significant difference in observed versus expected relative rates (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91-1.30), reported Rayzel Shulman, MD, PhD, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and colleagues in a research letter published in JAMA Network Open.\n\nPrevious data from the CDC showed an association between COVID infection and new-onset diabetes in children, they noted. Moreover, a study from earlier this year reported a 57% increase in cases of new-onset diabetes among kids admitted to a San Diego hospital from March 2020 to March 2021.\n\nDespite these findings, \"[t]here is no clear mechanism by which COVID-19 infection might cause new-onset diabetes,\" Shulman and team noted.\n\n\"The lack of both an observable increase in overall diabetes incidence among children during the 18-month pandemic restrictions and a plausible biological mechanism calls into question an association between COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes,\" they concluded. \"Given the variability in monthly RRs, additional population-based, longer-term data are needed to examine the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 and diabetes risk among children.\"\n\nBecause Canada has one of the highest incident rates of type 1 diabetes worldwide, Shulman and colleagues examined whether diabetes incidence increased during the pandemic among individuals ages 17 and younger in Ontario.\n\nThey used health administrative data from January 2017 to September 2021, and included all children eligible for universal healthcare insurance on January 1 of each year studied.\n\nFrom November 2020 to April 2021, an estimated 3.3% of youth in Ontario had COVID. The authors used generalized estimating equations for Poisson regression to model 3-year pre-COVID rates of new-onset diabetes adjusted for age, sex, pre-COVID month, and secular trend, and then used the models to estimate expected post-COVID monthly rates of new-onset diabetes.\n\nFor the 2021 cohort, 2,700,178 kids were included. Mean age was 9.2 years, and 48.7% were girls.\n\nShulman and team noted that the sample size for this study was small, which was a limitation. Furthermore, they could not differentiate between cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which may have affected results.\n\nElizabeth Short is an editorial intern for MedPage Today.

        "Vaccinated Have Lower Heart, Stroke Risk From COVID",
        "Full vaccination against COVID-19 was associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke as secondary complications of acute infection, a study from Korea showed.\n\nThese cardiovascular events were significantly reduced in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis for the fully vaccinated compared with those not vaccinated:\n\nComposite of hospitalizations for acute MI and ischemic stroke: adjusted HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.29-0.62)\n\nAcute MI: adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.25-0.94)\n\nIschemic stroke: adjusted HR 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.63)\n\nThe reduction in post-COVID heart attacks and strokes among the fully vaccinated was observed across various subgroups. However, it did not reach statistical significance for people with a previous history of outcome events or for those with severe or critical COVID-19.\n\n\"The findings support vaccination, especially for those with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,\" maintained Jaehun Jung, MD, PhD, of Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea, and colleagues reporting in a research letter in JAMA.\n\nIt had been unclear if vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 prevent secondary complications of COVID-19, Jung's group noted.\n\nThey took advantage of nationwide data from Korea, where COVID-19 reporting is mandated and universal health care coverage is in place.\n\nJung told MedPage Today that the present findings are not largely different than those in an earlier study on post-acute cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs prior to widespread vaccine availability, investigators had estimated strokes from 30 days after infection as occurring at a rate of 4.03 per 1,000 people at 12 months; post-COVID myocardial infarctions were reported at 2.91 per 1,000 people at 12 months.\n\nIn the Korean data, the stroke rate in unvaccinated individuals was 4.59 per million person-days and the MI rate was 1.60 per million person-days in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nThat data came retrospectively from a Korean nationwide COVID-19 registry and the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with COVID-19 from July 2020 to December 2021. For the primary outcome, the first 30 days had been excluded to minimize cardiovascular events occurring as complications of acute COVID-19.\n\nInvestigators compared COVID-19 patients never vaccinated (n=62,727) and those fully vaccinated (n=168,310). Fully vaccinated patients tended to be older and had more comorbidities.\n\nJung's group employed inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for these and other differences in patient characteristics. \"A robust model was applied to mitigate the effect of such imbalances, but the possibility of unobserved bias remains,\" the authors cautioned.\n\nAnother limitation of the study was its reliance on diagnostic codes, which may be subject to inaccuracies.\n\nNicole Lou is a reporter for MedPage Today, where she covers cardiology news and other developments in medicine.

        "Faust Files: A Talk With Deborah Birx, MD, on the Early COVID Response",
        "In this exclusive video, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, and Deborah Birx, MD, former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, have a candid discussion about Birx's new book, Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It's Too Late, which details the American pandemic response from within the White House.\n\nThe following is a transcript of their remarks:\n\nFaust: Hello, I'm Jeremy Faust, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today and the author of the \"Inside Medicine\" newsletter on Bulletin.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Deborah Birx. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Birx.\n\nBirx: Happy to be here.\n\nFaust: Thank you. Dr. Birx was -- well, before she became a household name, Dr. Birx ran the CDC's Division of Global HIV and AIDS and she oversaw PEPFAR, which is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which is one of the most successful public health interventions that our government has been a part of in recent decades, I would say. And then, of course, everything changed in 2020 when she became the first White House Coronavirus Response Task Force Coordinator.\n\nHer new book, Silent Invasion, is a detailed account of what it was like on the inside, and it is fascinating. I just finished reading it. It is bold. You pull no punches. Thank you for writing it, and thank you for being here.\n\nBirx: Thank you. Obviously, I've written a lot of scientific articles and a lot of chapters, but that was my first attempt to translate science into a book format.\n\nFaust: So let's talk about this book, Silent Invasion. I think I'm the intended recipient of this book in the sense of who I vaguely thought you were and who you are. Tell us about that gulf. What do people think of you and what do I successfully know now that I've read it?\n\nBirx: Well if you asked anyone around the globe in HIV, they would tell you who I am: hard driving, data driven, will do anything to ensure people's lives are saved.\n\nI knew when I was working on HIV that my patient was never the Ministry of Health; my patient was the community at risk for disease. So that's how I went into the White House. Yes, it was where I was working, but my loyalty was to the communities and the Americans that were at risk for COVID.\n\nFaust: But you strike me in the book as just a complete data wonk.\n\nBirx: Yes, total data wonk.\n\nFaust: And that's pretty much why you were brought in, is that right?\n\nBirx: I think so. I think two things: one, I had actually battled a pandemic, and successfully -- I mean, we have really made incredible strides on HIV and HIV/TB in Sub-Saharan Africa and around the globe.\n\nBut secondly, we did that through data. Making everybody visible that needed our help, not just the people we could see, but the people we couldn't see, and that's what data allows you to do.\n\nBut data is irrelevant if all it does is create an article. Data has to lead to action. Data has to be transparent.\n\nSo anytime we would change policy or guidelines or ask the Ministries of Health to change policy or guidelines, we all agreed on the data and the reason that we needed that policy change. I think in this country, we need to make data accessible to every American so they can analyze it themselves.\n\nFaust: Yeah. I mean, this is what I write about in my newsletter, and it's sort of my little shtick too. I was like, \"Oh, okay. She was me in the White House.\" That's what it kind of felt like.\n\nAnd in fact, there's this moment in the book where you talk about how you're on Google using Google Translate to read the Diamond Princess [cruise ship] statistics. I did the exact same thing. I wonder if we could find out, you know, how you can see page views, like how many people translated the Diamond Princess pages from Japanese to English. Well, at least two.\n\nTell me about those moments and when you started to realize the extent of asymptomatic transmission of this disease.\n\nBirx: I felt like it had to be happening in January, because you don't build a 1,000-bed hospital in a matter of days, or a 10,000-bed hospital, if you don't have unbelievable community spread. Because we don't have any viral diseases that only cause severe illness in one tiny group. Other people have to become infected and not be seen.\n\nBut I couldn't prove it. I think the Diamond Princess, for those like yourself who really took the time to really look at what happened in the Diamond Princess, you knew it had to be the crew. So to me, it was very clear, but not to everybody.\n\nFaust: And also the transmission dynamics are so bizarre.\n\nBirx: Exactly.\n\nFaust: Because you have a spouse living in a cabin and not getting it from their spouse. Yet at the same time, as you mentioned in MMWR -- the CDC's journal on morbidity and mortality -- in the report, we see this thing where one person in a choir gave it to dozens of people.\n\nSo it's just a very strange pathogen, right? It exploits our assumptions that we're gonna hunker down when we get sick, and this virus says, \"No, I'm gonna spread right before that happens.\"\n\nBirx: \"And I'm gonna spread it with young people who don't know they're infected.\"\n\nI just want to always, always make this clear, as with HIV or any infectious disease, people are not intentionally spreading it. They truly don't know. And it's our job as those of us in medicine and science and technology and healthcare to make sure that they have the tools to utilize that successfully to protect themselves and their family.\n\nFaust: So when you talk about kind of realizing the extent of asymptomatic transmission ...\n\nBirx: I love that you were doing the Diamond Princess translation too. I just love that.\n\nFaust: Yeah. I mean, it was very frustrating because they wouldn't update it often enough. And I took home two messages. One was that this is a very contagious pathogen. Two is that this is very, very dangerous for my parents' generation. And I thought it may be fine for everyone else. It took until later datasets to realize that we'd had excess mortality in young people, which -- we just didn't have a big enough N at that point.\n\nBut you talk about in the book, I love this, you said there are somewhere between three and 10 times, if given the tip of the iceberg at the beginning of an outbreak, if there's a hundred cases, there's probably 300 or there's probably a thousand.\n\nSo this is the first time we ever heard about an R-naught for this virus. That's the reproductive number. This is the number of people that the average person who gets infected subsequently infects. That's called an R.\n\nThe first number we were given was 2.58, which was a very alarming number, and then it was upgraded. But actually, when you take into account asymptomatic transmission, it's far higher. And I was part of a team that actually thought it was much higher.\n\nWhat do you think the R was? Then I'll tell you what we thought it was.\n\nBirx: I thought it was between 4 and 5. When I tried to paint that picture in the book -- because I had this group of people that I'm so grateful that came and worked with me because I didn't know what was gonna happen to their careers. I was older in my career, so even though I knew it was going to be terminal for my career, I didn't want that to happen to other people. But they understood how much I valued data and they understood I would need a team.\n\nSo three or four people showed up, and we argued about that and the degree of asymptomatic spread, because those two are so critically linked. So, I thought asymptomatic spread was well into the 50%-60% range -- by age group, it could vary up to 85% -- and we were able to get that data from colleges when they started testing regularly. But that's what was driving the doubling and tripling of the R-naught for me.\n\nFaust: I'll tell you a funny story. So, I was the middle author on a paper and we thought it was more likely in the teens. This was sent to a journal and they sent it back and they said, \"Well, that's impossible because it would have to be an airborne virus.\" And that was the end of that.\n\nBirx: Yes! What's upsetting to me is you and I looking at the Diamond Princess data are like, \"This is an aerosol. This is highly contagious. This is being spread asymptomatically. This is going to be a huge problem.\" And other people are saying it's on surfaces, that it's droplets, not realizing that that is just incomplete, partial RNA fragments.\n\nThat results in everybody wiping down their groceries rather than understanding aerosolized spread, which means it stays in the air for a number of hours. I always say to people, it doesn't matter who's in that room when you get there. It matters who's in that room before.\n\nFaust: Turnover, right? And this is the thing, I'm not a domain expert on aerosols, but recognizing that -- there were a lot of people who were very territorial saying, \"Oh, it's not airborne.\" And I said, \"Well, look, I don't know. All I know is that it's airborne enough.\"\n\nBirx: The data said it was airborne.\n\nFaust: It was moving through the air, and I didn't want to get into whether it was extended droplets or this or that.\n\nTalking about asymptomatic transmission, and you do talk about testing, and we all know the documentation of how we didn't do testing right. We have a lot of agreement on the use of rapid antigen tests and the idea that these are tests that might miss an early infection, they certainly will miss a late infection, but they should get you right when you're contagious, which is really the way you stop things. When did you first understand that?\n\nBirx: Very early. So when we had that first meeting on March 4th with the companies -- and these were companies I knew from HIV and I knew their capacity to produce tests -- and we asked for PCR tests, antigen tests, and antibody tests because I knew we had to get into the community and it had to be simple and fast because we needed the 20- and 30- and 40-somethings being willing to test.\n\nThey were not going to go sit in a drive-through for 4 hours and wait 5 days to get an answer. That wasn't going to happen, but people would come by quickly to do an antigen test. And they would've come back daily if we had asked them to. People were very responsive and really responsible. I never saw in all of my trips people being intentionally irresponsible.\n\nFaust: The rapid story is a little bit murky, but it seems like the FDA didn't really approve or authorize many. Is that fair to say?\n\nBirx: So here's the circular reasoning -- and you would understand this completely. So, all of the original tests were done on a set of specimens that were collected from people who were symptomatic, because we didn't have enough tests to test for people without symptoms. So they wouldn't approve it for asymptomatic use, and that was its value!\n\nAnd so, because they wouldn't approve it for asymptomatic use, even though I showed them that the viral load in the nasal cavities were identical between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic, they wouldn't approve it for that.\n\nAnd that resulted then in the CDC sending out guidance that it was provisional. Well, no one's gonna test twice! And we didn't have the resources to have everybody who was antigen positive go back and get another PCR.\n\nSo it just really hampered us, and they didn't approve antigen tests for asymptomatic testing until the summer of 2021.\n\nFaust: Right. Do you think these tests are still misunderstood?\n\nBirx: Totally!\n\nFaust: A lot of my colleagues, some really smart people, say that it gives people a sense of false security and therefore they go and they infect people.\n\nBirx: Absolutely not. If you explain it correctly and you say to them, \"These tests are for that moment in time. You may be negative tomorrow or you may be positive. And so if you're seeing your grandmother 3 days in a row, you're gonna have to test 3 days in a row.\"\n\nI think we've gone through 500 or 600 antigen tests. I mean, we definitively use testing. Even my daughter's children's preschool tests weekly. I'm so proud of that because it makes a huge difference.\n\nThe colleges that tested weekly had less than 1% to 2% community spread. The colleges that tested only those with symptoms infected 20% to 30% of their population. It's very clear. You have to find the pre-symptomatics and the asymptomatics.\n\nFaust: Yeah. I think that's a huge thing that people don't understand -- it's actionable information.\n\nI had a colleague, a friend, call me a few months ago when there was a concern that maybe they [rapid tests] don't work for Omicron. And they said, \"We had a family reunion\" -- and this is a really smart person -- \"and everyone tested before they came. And a couple of days later, everyone got sick.\" And I just said, \"Well, wait a second. Let's look at the number of cases there are. The test was good on Wednesday, but by the time you had your little thing on Friday, that was old news.\"\n\nBirx: So whenever I walk into an occasion, which I'm sure is a downer, whether it's a wedding or otherwise, I say, \"There are at least two or three people infected in here. So let's all be respectful and take care. And unless you tested the second before you walked in in the car, I can't tell that you are negative, and that's why I'm masking.\"\n\nFaust: I asked the audience here today in my session: what would you rather do? Be in a room full of boosted people in the past several months but have not tested, or in a room full of anti-vaxxers who all had a rapid antigen test that was negative a few hours ago. They looked very puzzled, and I've asked this question many times to many people, but it's not close. You want to be with the people who have negative tests regardless of their status.\n\nBirx: Exactly.\n\nFaust: Yeah. But our minds just don't work that way.\n\nBirx: Well, I think it's because, and I hold us responsible as public health practitioners and people who have reported on this, and I really appreciate your reporting because you've really tried to make it very clear about what we know and what we don't know.\n\nWhen we make broad statements, when we say to people that these vaccines are going to protect against infection -- one, it wasn't studied; two, we already knew re-infections were rampant with natural immunity. So the vaccines that were designed to mimic natural immunity are going to have re-infections. We imply that masks only work in one direction.\n\nAnd you know, Americans have amazing common sense, so when they hear that, they stop trusting the message. I think we are just as guilty for creating that sense that they don't trust us. We've waffled on tests and we haven't made them clear, we've waffled on masking, we've not been clear on vaccines, and then we wonder why people are confused.\n\nFaust: Yeah, I agree. And I think we should be humble about what we know at all times. Which is not really our best -- we're not so great at that.\n\nBirx: Well, I think if you had lived through the AIDS pandemic, you would be very good at it because when you've lived through that humbling \"I don't know and I can't fix it,\" that makes you very clear on \"This is what I know, this is what I don't know.\" And then we have to work in between.\n\nFaust: It's funny how lived experience matters. Another part of your book that actually really struck home for me was where you talked about the experience at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, [New York,] which really probably saved millions of lives.\n\nI trained there as an emergency resident at Mount Sinai and Elmhurst. So for me, when I started hearing stories from my colleagues at Elmhurst and hearing the sounds of their voices, I knew that this was real in a way that I hadn't really understood. And as you say in the book, this landed for Trump, didn't it?\n\nBirx: Totally. I don't think I would've been able to convince him of the 30 days and the reopening criteria if he hadn't had the Elmhurst experience combined with his friend being hospitalized and then succumbing to COVID. I think that was so real and personal, and somehow we have to figure out as practitioners how we can make it real and personal without people having to have that kind of level of intimate experience.\n\nI think that's what we can learn from media training. That's what we could learn from big marketers, because we have to figure out how to make our messages real for everyone.\n\nFaust: I mean, that's like the Ryan White approach with HIV, right? Or Tom Hanks doing Philadelphia? That's really what that's about.\n\nBirx: Exactly. And I think showing people that that is the experience, and you don't have to live it.\n\nFaust: Yeah. Megan Ranney and I wrote a piece about this in April or May, and we said, \"Look, by the time that everyone statistically knows one person who has died of this virus, there will be a million deaths.\" And we don't want to wait for that.\n\nBirx: We don't. And we did.\n\nEmily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

        "Insight Into Long COVID; Injections Offer No Benefit for Knee Osteoarthritis",
        "TTHealthWatch is a weekly podcast from Texas Tech. In it, Elizabeth Tracey, director of electronic media for Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, and Rick Lange, MD, president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, look at the top medical stories of the week.\n\nThis week's topics include factors that contribute to severe outcomes in immunocompromised people with COVID, a new oral medication for severe COVID-19, lack of benefit in knee injections for osteoarthritis, and insight into long COVID.\n\nProgram notes:\n\n0:52 Insight into long COVID\n\n1:53 What about the variants?\n\n2:42 Factors related to severe COVID in immunocompromised\n\n3:42 Non-immunocompromised lowest risk\n\n4:42 Vaccination does not decrease death risk if hospitalized\n\n5:15 Oral therapy for COVID\n\n6:15 How long in hospital?\n\n7:15 How microtubule disruption works\n\n8:15 Hyaluronic acid injections in knees in BMJ\n\n9:20 560 million worldwide living with knee OA\n\n10:20 Many of the studies haven't been published\n\n11:30 End\n\nTranscript:\n\nElizabeth Tracey: What accounts for severe outcomes among immunocompromised adults hospitalized with COVID-19?\n\nRick Lange, MD: A new oral therapy for high-risk hospitalized adults with COVID-19.\n\nElizabeth: A real lack of benefit seen in knee injections for osteoarthritis.\n\nRick: And a study that provides insight into the long COVID symptoms.\n\nElizabeth: That's what we're talking about this week on TTHealthWatch, your weekly look at the medical headlines from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso. I'm Elizabeth Tracey, a Baltimore-based medical journalist.\n\nRick: And I'm Rick Lange, president of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso where I'm also dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine.\n\nElizabeth: We'll apologize a priori to everybody who is listening. You are in France riding your bicycle so we have a few drop-outs sometimes. Let's turn to, gosh, this week we have got three out of four studies on COVID. So which of your two would you like to start with?\n\nRick: According to the World Health Organization, about one-quarter of individuals who develop COVID infection continue to experience symptoms 4 to 5 weeks and approximately 1 in 10 have continuing symptoms for 12 weeks. We have called that in the past \"long COVID\" symptoms, but the more recent scientific expression is called post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, or PASC. This is a study that may provide a little insight into that.\n\nThe study is conducted from some investigators at Harvard, who analyzed plasma samples collected from about 37 individuals that had long COVID or PASC and they compared it to 26 individuals that also had COVID. They looked at the different protein biomarkers to see if they could identify some that were associated with PASC. What they had discovered was in this individual study about two-thirds of them had persistent spike proteins detected in their blood, whereas those without long COVID symptoms did not. There might be some sort of persistent reservoir in the body.\n\nElizabeth: This, let me just mention, is published on their preprint server, medRxiv. I'm interested in any information that may have been in this -- and there may not be any -- about the subtypes of which strain of COVID-19 are we talking about.\n\nRick: This study actually spans three different viruses that have been present, but the spike protein ends up being relatively conserved across the different types. There are two different subtypes of the spike protein called S1 and S2 and then the combined [one]. It was a combination that was detected in two-thirds of the individuals.\n\nElizabeth: Clearly, one of the things that we are going to need in order to really nail this down is going to be a whole lot more than 60-something patients and a whole lot more factors assessed.\n\nRick: I agree. This is a preliminary study. It's a small number of individuals and needs a larger cohort. If there is a persistent reservoir, we need to figure out where that is.\n\nElizabeth: More to come. Let's turn to Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, and this is a look at what are the factors among immunocompromised people that are associated with severe outcomes when in fact they are hospitalized with COVID-19?\n\nThis study was conducted looking at ICU admission and in-hospital deaths from March 1st 2020 to February 28th 2022. They looked also among these folks at vaccination status, and this is all part of the COVID-NET Surveillance Network from the CDC. This was a sample of 22,000+ adults hospitalized for COVID-19; 12.2% of this sample were immunocompromised.\n\nThey looked at unvaccinated patients and those with immunocompromise clearly have higher odds of ICU admission and in-hospital death than non-immunocompromised people, and also fully vaccinated people for that matter. Of course, non-immunocompromised patients have lower odds of death than especially those who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated. The rather daunting news in my mind was that among these immunocompromised patients who were hospitalized, their odds of death between those who were vaccinated and those who were not vaccinated did not differ.\n\nThey also come to the conclusion that what we really need to do is maintain. among those who were immunocompromised, a lot of the physical separations among their close contacts, also close contact immunization, of course, early testing, prophylactic medication administration, and then early antiviral treatment as soon as they become positive for COVID-19.\n\nRick: I agree with you. There are some parts of the study that I think are encouraging. For example, one of the facts is that COVID-19 vaccination among immunocompromised persons is highly protective against being hospitalized for an infection. However, as you said, what's disappointing is once they are hospitalized the vaccination does not decrease the result of being in the ICU or death if we want to keep them out of the hospital.\n\nThe thing that is otherwise a little bit disconcerting among this particular study is even though when you look at immunocompromised individuals, they only compose about less than 3% of the adult population, yet they accounted for 12% of the adult hospitalizations in the COVID-NET. When we talk about being immunocompromised, these are people with AIDS, on steroid therapy, have solid organ transplant, and people that have multiple myeloma. Let's change gears and talk about something that's really encouraging, and that's a new oral therapy.\n\nElizabeth: That's right. Let's turn to that and that's in NEJM Evidence.\n\nRick: This is a medicine called sabizabulin. It's an oral agent that has dual properties. It's antiviral and it's anti-inflammatory. It has been tested in preclinical models. Here, it's being used in high-risk hospice adults. Now, by the way, we have very few therapies that are effective in this group.\n\nThey looked at 204 patients, again hospitalized adults with COVID-19, a high risk for dying, or a high risk for being in the ICU or on mechanical ventilation. They randomized them to routine therapy that could include remdesivir, dexamethasone, or whatever else.\n\nThe other half -- or [rather] two-thirds of patients -- actually received, in addition to that, sabizabulin, an oral agent administered once a day for up to 21 days. They followed these individuals for 60 days looking at mortality -- that was their primary endpoint -- and secondarily how long were they in the ICU or how long were they on mechanical ventilation, or how long were they in the hospital?\n\nHere is the thing that was really encouraging. With regard to 60-day mortality to tell you how high risk this group was, in those that received routine standard care the mortality at 60 days was 45%. That was cut in half to 20% with the use of sabizabulin in addition to routine therapy. There was a 43% reduction in ICU days, about a 50% reduction in days on mechanical ventilation, and about a 26% reduction in days in the hospital, all versus placebo. By the way, fewer side effects in those that received sabizabulin than those that received just standard care. This is really encouraging news.\n\nElizabeth: Yeah, and it accounts for why they're publishing it so early. I guess we should thank them for that.\n\nIt's an interesting mechanism for me. They described it as a novel microtubule disruptor. I'm wondering about that mechanism. Certainly, that's a mechanism in other types of infections that involve things like retrograde transmission in neurons, but I'm just wondering how it actually works with regard to viral replication.\n\nRick: OK, so here is what it does. It disrupts the microtubules that are inside the cells and these microtubules are responsible for transporting the virus into the cell within the cell, replicating, and also causing the virus after it's replicated to leave the cell. Microtubules are involved in all of that, so this disrupts those. That's the primary mechanism.\n\nSecondly, it's also anti-inflammatory. We know that the cytokine storm that comes after the viral infection is responsible for the respiratory distress syndrome, the septic shock, and their frequent death. By both inhibiting microtubules, or disrupting them, and being anti-inflammatory, these dual properties are what make it so effective -- even as an oral agent.\n\nElizabeth: I'm just really fascinated with this. I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that this novel microtubule disruption mechanism, maybe we are going to be hearing a lot more about this in a lot of other meds.\n\nRick: I wouldn't be surprised that this could be extended to other therapies or other diseases in the future. Speaking of things that have been effective, let's talk about something that is not effective therapy.\n\nElizabeth: Yes, so this is taking a look at knee injections for knee osteoarthritis. I learned a new word -- I don't know if you knew this one before or not -- viscosupplementation. That's the injection of different things into the knee in an attempt to kind of improve both the volume and the viscosity of the fluid that's normally in the joint. This was something that came over the transom a while ago. I seem to remember us talking about it when we first started hearing about potential for this therapy and it makes intuitive sense.\n\nThis is a meta-analysis, of course, where they took a look at 169 trials providing data on almost 22,000, just over 21,000 randomized participants. Their primary outcome measure was pain intensity. They basically found that there really wasn't any evidence to support the use of injections into the knee for osteoarthritis. That's really bad news for the 560 million people worldwide who are living with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nThis hyaluronic acid really doesn't help at all, and the bad news is that there is strong conclusive evidence indicating that this strategy is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including infections. It sounds like everybody ought to be putting away those needles.\n\nRick: Elizabeth, as you mentioned, this is a really incredible study. It's incredibly important because recently one in every seven patients with knee osteoarthritis in the United States have received injections of hyaluronic acid or its derivatives as first-line treatment.\n\nWe spent recently over $325 million using this hyaluronic acid injection. About a fourth of that was spent on, as you said, the complications -- that is, large-joint infections that occur because you stick a needle into a joint and the joint itself becomes infected. About one in 25 individuals who receive an injection will develop one of those infections.\n\nThe other thing that I thought was really interesting, Elizabeth, is this has been reviewed before in a meta-analysis, but this one included 80 studies that weren't previously reported. Many of those, by the way, haven't been published because they are negative studies. The hyaluronic acid doesn't prove to be beneficial and they just don't publish the studies. That leads to bias. These particular authors were able to come across those studies and identify them, again, to prove that this particular therapy really isn't beneficial.\n\nElizabeth: A definitely eloquent argument for why we should have some kind of repository for all studies.\n\nRick: In fact, that's what clinicaltrials.gov does. To start a clinical trial, you have to register it with the government and then they subsequently look to see, \"Were the results published or not?\" If they aren't, and it's a negative study, then that leads to what we would call publication bias -- they only publish studies that are positive, where the treatment seems like it's more effective than it really is.\n\nElizabeth: On that note, then, safe time on your bicycle. Don't overuse your knees so you aren't tempted to have an injection. That's a look at this week's medical headlines from Texas Tech. I'm Elizabeth Tracey.\n\nRick: And I'm Rick Lange.

        "A Nurse. A Pandemic. An Addiction.",
        "Listen and subscribe on Apple, Stitcher, and Spotify so you don't miss the next one. And if you like what you hear, a five-star rating goes a long way in helping us spread the word!\n\nThank you for joining us here on Anamnesis, a medical storytelling podcast from MedPage Today. My name is Shannon Firth. I'm a reporter with MedPage and I'll be your host for this episode.\n\nFor those of you who listen in regularly, this month's episode will be a little different. Instead of three stories from individual clinicians on a theme, we're bringing you just one story. An important story focused on the underreported, sometimes overlooked, challenges for nurses who struggle with substance use.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the public romanticized the role of nurses, casting them as superheroes -- women and men who sacrificed everything for their patients. But for many, the grief, stress, and exhaustion took a toll. In one survey, nearly half of critical care nurses said they felt depressed, and a third said they were drinking more. Six percent said they felt suicidal.\n\nAnd that's where the story of Tiffany Swedeen comes in.\n\nOver the holidays, a nurse in recovery from opioid use disorder struggled to keep her addiction in check. She was caring for coronavirus patients on the front lines in an ICU outside Seattle. She asked her hospital for more support, and received little. She reached out to her family, but that just made things worse. On Sunday, January 3, 2021, Tiffany Swedeen relapsed.\n\nTiffany's story highlights the fact that when it comes to substance use disorders, our healthcare system has one standard for patients and another for nurses. And while nurses have responsibilities not only to themselves, but to the public, it's worth remembering that substance use disorder is still a chronic but treatable brain disease, and not a moral failing.\n\nThis episode of Anamnesis features discussions of drug abuse and suicide that may be disturbing to some listeners. Discretion is advised.\n\nChapter 1. Blacked Out on Fentanyl for a Day (2:40) -- A nurse in recovery shares one of her loneliest moments.\n\nChapter 2. Job, License, and Livelihood on the Line (11:09) -- After diverting drugs, the foundation begins to crack for this nurse.\n\nChapter 3. Nurses Are Not Unbreakable (26:20) -- We as a society need to serve nurses better.\n\nEpisode produced and hosted by Shannon Firth\n\nSpecial thanks to Crystal Phend\n\nSound engineering by Emily Hutto\n\nTheme music by Palomar\n\nWant to share your story?

        "Understanding Epstein-Barr virus\u2013associated disease via spatial phenotyping: From primary infection to malignancy",
        "This webinar is brought to you by the Science /AAAS Custom Publishing Office\n\nSpatial phenotyping allows researchers to view, characterize, and quantify cells by lineage and variant with single-cell resolution in the context of an intact tissue sample. In areas such as oncology, immunology, and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases, it has opened new insights into the interplay between different cellular actors in promoting or suppressing disease. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a group 1 carcinogen, is a causative factor for nine different cancers that cause roughly 165,000 deaths globally each year. EBV is asymptomatically carried among almost all adults, with the virus persisting primarily in rare memory B cells. However, in some infected individuals, EBV is associated with the development of cancer. The immune microenvironment in which infected cells reside may influence or trigger cancer development, but it is still unknown how this occurs.\n\nThis webinar will address how spatial phenotyping is uniquely suited to outline one of the putative causative relationships between EBV infections, immunosuppression, and cancer.\n\n\n\nDuring this webinar, viewers will:\n\nLearn how a meticulously designed and highly specific antibody panel provides the sensitivity and specificity required to characterize Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\n\nBe presented with a framework that associates specific EBV expression profiles with a unique tissue architecture and immune infiltrate\n\nDiscover how end-to-end analysis pipelines are used to examine high-dimensional spatial data\n\nUncover how cellular neighborhood analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides unbiased analysis of tissue microenvironments.\n\nThis webinar will last for approximately 60 minutes."

        "BA. 5: What We Know About Protection From Vaccines and Infections",
        "Share on Pinterest Getty Images The BA.5 subvariant of the omicron coronavirus accounts for the majority of COVID-19 cases in the U.S .\n\n. Recent research has found people who are fully vaccinated and had a previous COVID-19 case had the most robust antibody response.\n\nNew CDC research on people over age 50 also found that having a 2nd COVID-19 booster does help decrease the risk of infection. COVID cases are increasing across the United States due to the immune-evasive and highly-transmissible BA.5 variant. BA.5, which accounts for 65% of infections in the U.S., has mutations on the spike protein \u2014 the part of the virus that allows for cell entry \u2014 that have helped it spread quickly and partially evade antibodies generated from previous infections or vaccinations. Recent evidence suggests that the type of variant you were previously infected with can influence your risk of reinfection. People who previously had Omicron appear to be much more protected against new infections with Omicron subvariants than those infected with past variants like Delta. But even a recent Omicron infection won\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t get COVID-19 again sometime soon. \u201cBA.5 is different enough from some of the other Omicron strains that people have been reinfected fairly quickly after their prior infection,\u201d Dr. Ted Cohen, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, told Healthline.\n\nHow protected are you if you\u2019ve been vaccinated or had COVID? Reinfections are possible, even within weeks after a prior infection, but it\u2019s unclear how common reinfections are. A recent preprint of a study from Qatar found that the strength of immunity from a prior infection largely depends on which variant you were infected with. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed. People who were infected with a variant that preceded Omicron \u2014 such as Delta or Alpha \u2014 were estimated to be about 15% protected from a symptomatic BA.5 reinfection. Individuals who developed an Omicron case \u2014 which was first detected in the United States in December 2021 \u2014 were estimated to be 76% protected against a symptomatic BA.5 reinfection. \u201cIf people have had previous infections with Omicron lineage strains, they can be reinfected, but it\u2019s quite plausible that they have more of the protection than those who had been infected before that,\u201d Cohen said. Though people who recently had an Omicron case appear to have greater protection, it\u2019s unknown how durable that protection is, says Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an epidemiologist and professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine. Prior evidence has shown that immunity against symptomatic infections wane with time. In general, the longer out from a past infection, you are, the less robust your immune response will be. \u201cEven quite recent infection with Omicron BA.1/BA.2 doesn\u2019t provide complete protection against BA.4/BA.5. As the summer wears on, expect any protection to wane,\u201d Parsonnet said.\n\nVaccination and booster doses strengthen protection Though BA.5 can evade antibodies \u2014 the initial immune response that protects us from infection \u2014 prior infection and vaccination provide strong protection against severe outcomes, according to Cohen. Previous studies have looked at how vaccines and previous infections can protect against Omicron strains, although the research was done before the rise of BA. 5. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine indicated that three doses of the vaccine provided better protection than two doses. Data from a study of people over age 50 from the CDC similarly found that each additional dose boosts protection against infection. \u201cBooster vaccinations increase antibodies quite a bit, which helps to overcome some of the virus\u2019 immune evasion,\u201d Dr. Anne Liu, an infectious disease doctor, said. The most severe infections continue to be in unvaccinated people, according to Cohen. \u201cIt seems that the severity of disease is probably significantly less, so there is benefit in terms of prior infections and vaccination for severity of outcomes,\u201d Cohen said. Another study published this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that at least one COVID-19 booster helped add key protection against severe COVID-19 symptoms during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 wave. A first booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was 52% effective against hospitalization in the 120 days after getting the shot. People over aged 50, who received a first COVID-19 booster, were 55% percent protected against hospitalization in the 120 days after getting that shot. With a second dose that effectiveness increased to 80%. Only people aged 50 and those with certain underlying conditions have been recommended to get a second COVID-19 booster shot in the U.S.\n\nWhat to know about BA.5 Currently, daily cases of reported COVID-19 are averaging around 126,000, according to the CDC. Sewage surveillance, which monitors the levels of the coronavirus in wastewater, has revealed that the current surge is likely much greater than what is being captured with testing. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous amount of virus going around,\u201d Parsonnet said. Evidence has suggested that B.A. 5\u2019s immune-evasive properties are raising the infection rate, but at the same time, most people are no longer adhering to the precautions previously used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. \u201cThe number of people infected by a single infected person also may increase because there are fewer precautions being taken now among the general population,\u2019 Lui said. Hospitalizations have increased nationwide by about 10% for the week ending July 10 compared to the previous week. But according to Parsonnet, the hospitalization rate can be difficult to pin down because many people may be admitted for other health issues but may simultaneously carry the virus, so they are listed as COVID infections. The most important marker to track is the death rate, and at this time, deaths do not appear to be rising. \u201cData continue to show that deaths among vaccinated are still lower than among unvaccinated, meaning that the vaccines are still doing what they are meant to do: save our lives,\u201d Parsonnet said."

        "Don\u2019t Ignore These Signs of Heat Stroke This Summer",
        "Share on Pinterest YUKI IWAMURA/AFP via Getty Images Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are potentially fatal conditions when temperatures rise.\n\nExperts say it\u2019s critical to know the signs, symptoms, and how to help yourself or others when heat illness occurs.\n\nHeat stroke happens when the body can no longer regulate its temperature to cool down. Each year more people in the U.S. die from extreme heat exposure than from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The ongoing climate crisis has disrupted weather patterns across much of the U.S., with multiple cities declaring heat emergencies in recent days. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are potentially fatal conditions when temperatures rise, and it\u2019s critical to know the signs, symptoms, and how to help yourself or others when heat illness occurs.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke? Dr. Adam Rivadeneyra, a sports medicine physician with Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Southern California, told Healthline that heat illness is a \u201ccontinuum,\u201d with heatstroke involving neurologic changes, like loss of consciousness and/or seizures. The CDC describes heat exhaustion as a \u201cmilder form\u201d of heat-related illness that could develop after several days of exposure to high temperatures and inadequate or unbalanced replacement of fluids. Heat stroke, the agency explained, happens when the body can no longer regulate its temperature to cool down. Within 10 to 15 minutes, body temperature could reach 106 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, and without emergency treatment, the condition can lead to death or permanent disability.\n\nSymptoms to look out for Dr. Theodore Strange, chair of medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, part of Northwell Health in New York, said our body temperature is normally regulated to stay about 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. He emphasized that it\u2019s \u201cconcerning\u201d once someone\u2019s temperature exceeds 104 degrees. Strange said there are three stages of heat injury to look out for; heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and, heat stroke. \u201cSigns and symptoms of heat exhaustion may develop suddenly or over time,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cEspecially with prolonged periods of exercise.\u201d According to Strange, possible signs and symptoms of heat illness can include cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat, as well as: Heavy sweating\n\nFaintness\n\nWeak, rapid pulse\n\nMuscle cramps\n\nNausea\n\nHeadaches \u201cChildren have additional risk of heat illness due to smaller surface area of their skin, which makes it harder to dissipate heat through sweating,\u201d said Rivadeneyra\n\nPreventing heat illness Strange said, \u201cthe best prevention\u201d is not to exercise or perform strenuous activities during the peak heat time of day or in direct sunlight. \u201cA must is to drink plenty of fluids both before and after the activities which should include water and electrolyte drinks,\u201d he advised. He pointed out that younger and older persons have to be particularly careful, as their bodies don\u2019t have the regulatory ability to adapt to high temperatures. Strange said steps we can take to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke include: Wearing looser, lighter clothing to help dispel the heat\n\nAvoid alcohol and heavy meals\n\nAvoid getting sunburned\n\nEnergy disruptions are making things worse According to Houston Public Media, Texans are being asked to conserve energy even as the state experiences scorching temperatures. Last week, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) asked state residents to conserve power as the region continues to break power usage levels. ERCOT encouraged Texans to raise thermostat levels to 78 degrees and delay using large appliances, as part of a collective effort to avoid rolling blackouts. \u201cThe real issue that they are facing is that most of that capacity is non-dispatchable,\u201d Kevin Jones, PhD, associate professor at University of Houston Downtown\u2019s College of Business, said in a statement. \u201cIn other words, generation sources, particularly wind, you can\u2019t access directly on demand,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor example when there\u2019s a really hot day, but no wind, you won\u2019t be able to rely on your wind turbine to generate the energy that you need for your grid.\u201d\n\nHow to help someone with heat illness If you see someone suffering from heat stress, the Red Cross recommends you follow these steps: If they\u2019re losing consciousness or vomiting, immediately call 9-1-1\n\nRelocate the person to an air-conditioned or shaded area\n\nProvide cool water they can drink slowly\n\nApply ice or cold towels to the head, neck, groin, wrists, ankles and underarms Rivadeneyra noted that immersing someone in cold water is the \u201cbest way\u201d to rapidly cool them.\n\nWhen you have no air conditioning \u201cHeat waves may also cause power outages,\u201d Ariane Einecker, interim CEO, American Red Cross North Texas Region, said in a statement. Einecker said when this happens people should have a plan to go where air conditioning is available until power is restored. The Red Cross advises anyone without access to air conditioning to seek relief from the heat during the warmest part of the day in places like schools, libraries, theaters, or malls. Jane Gilbert, chief heat officer for Miami-Dade County, told CNN that people without air conditioning can keep cool by leaving windows open, using fans, and putting cold towels on their necks."

        "Retracted coronavirus (COVID-19) papers",
        "via CDC\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking retractions of papers about COVID-19 as part of our database. Here\u2019s a running list, which will be updated as needed. (For some context on these figures, see this post, our letter in Accountability in Research and the last section of this Nature news article. Also see a note about the terminology regarding preprint servers at the end.)\n\nRetracted\n\nExpressions of concern\n\nNote: Retraction Watch does not draw a distinction between withdrawal and retraction, because journals that have done so have typically done it to justify not saying anything about why a paper was retracted, and to sometimes make a paper disappear without a trace. Richard Sever, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, asked that we include a comment from him about how the processes for withdrawing preprints and retracting journal articles may differ: Journals may retract a paper at the authors\u2019 request and/or if the editors identify fundamental flaws that would have precluded acceptance if spotted during review. [RW: Note that some journals insist that they cannot make such moves without authors\u2019 permission.] A preprint is usually withdrawn only at an authors\u2019 request. A preprint server will not typically withdraw a flawed preprint against the wishes of the author, since the server made no claim to have peer-reviewed and certified the scientific content in the first place. At the same time, preprint servers *will* withdraw a preprint against the authors\u2019 wishes in instances of fraud, ethics violations, dangerous material, or legal issues. It is thus the nature of preprints that there will be some that contain errors but are not withdrawn and would not appear in the above list. [RW: The same is, of course, true of some papers in peer-reviewed journals.]\n\nLike Retraction Watch? You can make a tax-deductible contribution to support our work, follow us on Twitter, like us on Facebook, add us to your RSS reader, or subscribe to our daily digest.

        "Ensuring Equitable Access to Health Care for Our Communities",
        "Published March 4, 2021\n\nJohns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Emergency Department.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine is committed to providing equitable care to all, while improving the health and wellness of our patients, personnel and residents in all our neighboring communities.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made existing health disparities even more apparent. In light of this concern, Johns Hopkins Medicine will continue to develop new ways to reach all populations \u2014 with specific consideration for vulnerable ones \u2014 to provide access to essential COVID-19 information and services. These include testing, care options, potential therapies, best practices to prevent the spread of illness, emotional support resources, language access options, and much more.\n\nWith highly effective vaccines now available to us in accordance with government supply distribution, we are focused on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for eligible populations. To help achieve this, Johns Hopkins Medicine has mobilized a multidisciplinary task force specifically focused on vaccine distribution, with equity and inclusion built into its foundation.\n\nThrough this task force, we continue to reach out to all of our patients, our neighboring communities and our personnel in many ways:\n\nMyChart (available in English and Spanish.) is a secure website that provides your up-to-date medical information available to you about your care and your health care team.\n\nEfforts to Reach Our Patients\n\nAs government agencies continue to open vaccine eligibility to certain demographic groups, Johns Hopkins Medicine offers our patients information and access to resources through the MyChart electronic health record system, direct emails, our website, video content, social media, as well as through our health care providers and other referring physicians. Importantly, we ensure that we can reach our patients who may have limited computer or broadband access by providing a dedicated telephone call center that notifies patients of vaccine appointment availability. We also share information through local news and media outlets, as well as by sharing resources through community partner programs. We are committed to ensuring that our patients who want to be vaccinated receive the information they need \u2014 and, ultimately, the vaccine, as our supply allocations allow.\n\nRead more about efforts to reach our patients\n\nOutreach to Our Neighboring Communities\n\nJohns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center opened a drive-through testing site for COVID-19 patient referrals and other identified priority groups.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine also has various partnerships and programs in place to reach our neighbors in nearby communities. For example, our Maryland and Washington, D.C., providers continue to collaborate with local governments to help vaccinate specific groups, such as public school employees. In addition, we are going onsite to various senior housing facilities to vaccinate these highly vulnerable residents where they live. We are also working closely with the University of Maryland Medical System to operate the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital, which offers COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy, vaccinations, as well as clinical care.\n\nIn addition, we have mobilized teams that are going out into the community to provide services, including testing and vaccinations within neighborhoods that have had high numbers of COVID-19 illnesses. In a collaborative effort between the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity, Johns Hopkins Medicine Language Services, and Centro Sol, a new pilot program \u2014 called Juntos \u2014 has helped to provide equitable resources to our Spanish-speaking inpatients with COVID-19. We are also leveraging well-established relationships with community and faith-based organizations to disseminate information about the vaccine.\n\nRead more about our outreach to neighboring communities\n\nConnecting with Our Personnel\n\nIncident Command Center\n\nAdditionally, our health care systemwide Incident Command Center and our diversity councils are collaborating to reach our personnel across their various roles within the health care system to ensure that they have all the vaccine information and access they need. Just as with our patients, we are leveraging MyChart for vaccine appointment scheduling and notifications. To further enable this, we have established MyChart activation and support stations in our hospitals to ensure that those personnel whose work is not computer-based will receive assistance with securing appointments.\n\nWe have also established a special telephone line for personnel who lack computer access or who may experience technology challenges with accessing a vaccine appointment. Knowing that different personnel receive information in different ways, we have developed multiple means of communication \u2014 including signs, videos, infographics and a dedicated internal website, among other things \u2014 to help provide critical information to our staff.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we remain focused on creating effective and meaningful programs to ensure that our personnel, patients and neighboring communities feel they have the information and access they need to COVID-19 resources to remain informed and healthy.\n\nFor more information about COVID-19 and important resources. For more information about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nRead more about efforts to engage with our personnel"

A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people infected with the omicron variant BA.1 produced infectious virus for about six to eight days on average, with some people shedding infectious virus for 10 days or longer.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know which of the omicron variants now circulating my relative had, but we did know that we didn\u2019t want to catch it. Omicron carries a higher chance of being passed on to household members than earlier variants of concern did, a recent JAMA Network Open study found. For instance, omicron had a secondary household attack rate of 42.7 percent, referring to the percentage of household members who got COVID-19 from an infected person in the house. That beats other highly infectious variants by a mile: Alpha\u2019s rate was 36.4 percent and delta\u2019s 29.7 percent. And the currently circulating subvariant of omicron, BA.5, may even reinfect people who recently had COVID-19 (SN: 6/27/22).\n\nSo how do you evade a virus that has been catching up with even those who have so far managed to avoid infection for years? A lot of people are probably asking that question right now, given that the CDC\u2019s community transmission map is red across the country (more than 93 percent of counties are reporting high community transmission), and my own personal gauge \u2014 Anna Gibbs\u2019 reporting on experts\u2019 advice on what to do after a positive COVID test \u2014 is consistently among Science News\u2019 most-read stories (SN: 4/22/22).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of different options, and you could do one or many of them, depending on your situation and how concerned you are about getting it,\u201d says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist who studies disease transmission at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.\n\nThe first option is to isolate the infected person from the rest of the household. For most people that probably involves putting someone in a room alone and closing the door. We did an admittedly extreme version of secluding our COVID-19 patient by putting up plastic sheeting to wall off our guest bedroom and guest bathroom as an isolation suite. Making things as airtight as possible may help limit the virus\u2019 spread in the house, Marr says. You don\u2019t need to erect a plastic wall like we did, though. Rolling up a towel and sticking it under the door may reduce the amount of air flowing in and out of an infected person\u2019s room. That is a tactic Marr says she uses when staying in hotel rooms.\n\nWe used plastic sheeting, a large zipper (sometimes used at construction projects to contain dust) and tape to make an isolation suite for a family member who got COVID-19. T.H. Saey\n\nIn our house, my relative went into the isolation suite and emerged only to retrieve meals I left for her on a tray just outside the zipper and to go for brief (masked) walks around the neighborhood.\n\nBut not everyone has such a high tolerance for solitude or has a housing situation that allows for a sick ward. And it\u2019s not really feasible to isolate children or household members that need care. Our isolation suite wouldn\u2019t have worked for Marr\u2019s 14-year-old son, she says. \u201cHe\u2019s very social. It would have been torture to make him stay in his room.\u201d\n\nNot to worry. Marr says there are plenty of ways to keep the virus away from uninfected family members. Good quality face coverings, such as N95, KN95 or KF94 masks, can help keep the virus in check (SN: 3/25/22). \u201cThe most important person to have wear a mask is the infected person because it acts as source control to keep the virus from getting out in the air,\u201d Marr says. Uninfected family members can wear masks as an extra layer of protection, too. My relative graciously wore her mask when outside of the isolation suite, and my husband and I masked and gloved up when we dropped off meals and retrieved dishes.\n\nBut Marr\u2019s son wasn\u2019t keen on wearing a mask, so her family took other measures. \u201cWe had a portable air cleaner and moved that around with him wherever he was. We did eat dinner together. We opened a window and had him sitting closest to the window with a fan pointing out, so that everything from him was getting sucked out.\u201d Their plan worked. Nobody else in Marr\u2019s household got COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIncreased ventilation, of course, is going to be very helpful,\u201d she says. That might involve opening windows when the weather allows and running the bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Pointing a fan out the open window in an infected person\u2019s room will also help limit the amount of virus reaching the rest of the household. Open windows aren\u2019t always welcome, especially when it\u2019s too cold or hot outside or during allergy season or when other conditions degrade air quality. For instance, \u201cthis assumes your outdoor air is not full of wildfire smoke,\u201d Marr says.\n\nFiltering the air can also reduce the amount of virus floating around the house. We put a portable air cleaner in the isolation suite. And we built a Corsi-Rosenthal box to filter any stray virus that wandered into our air space. The box is a do-it-yourself alternative to pricey HEPA filters. We built ours from four large air filters, a box fan and the cardboard box the fan came in (for the bottom of the box and a shroud for the top). Such boxes aren\u2019t HEPA filters, but they have a higher clean air delivery rate than many commercial machines because they move so much air, Marr says. Still, the box wasn\u2019t cheap to build. It cost about $130, with each filter costing just under $25.\n\nA Corsi-Rosenthal box, built with a box fan and air filters can suck the coronavirus, allergens and irritants out of the air. This is the one we built to filter out SARS-CoV-2 when an infected relative visited. T.H. Saey\n\n\u201cAll of these things you can do will reduce your risk by some amount, and the more you layer on top of each other, the more you reduce your risk,\u201d Marr says. Also important is to keep vulnerable people away from the infected person. Vulnerable people include the elderly, immunocompromised people or others with medical conditions that put them at high risk of severe disease.\n\nThe good news is that once the infection is over, the virus is probably gone. \u201cThe air doesn\u2019t typically stick around in a house, even when everything is closed up \u2026 for more than a few hours. It leaks in and out,\u201d Marr says. As for cleaning surfaces and laundry, there\u2019s no need to buy special products. \u201cRegular soap will easily kill the virus,\u201d she says.\n\nOur relative\u2019s positive line on at-home antigen tests grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared during her stay. Now, more than a week after her departure, my husband and I are still feeling fine and getting negative results on our at-home tests. It wasn\u2019t easy and it certainly wasn\u2019t fun (especially for my sequestered relative) to ward off the pestilence within our walls, but it\u2019s possible. If the coronavirus invades your home, I hope you\u2019ll be able to escape it, too.\n\nStay safe in there!"

        "Risk Factors for \u201cLong COVID\u201d in Children",
        "Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as post-COVID-19 conditions or long COVID, are a growing cause for concern. Beating COVID-19 is unfortunately no longer limited to surviving the infection, as lingering symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and more can severely hinder one\u2019s quality of life.\n\nChildren, once erroneously believed to be protected from the worst of COVID-19, have been experiencing more severe disease with the rise of the Omicron variant. One study, published in JAMA, examined the proportion of children who contracted COVID-19 and reported post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) 90 days after visiting an emergency department.\n\nThis prospective cohort study ran from March 7, 2020-January 20, 2021, drawing on indexing data from 36 emergency departments (EDs) in 8 countries.\n\nThe study enrolled 8642 children, and this was narrowed down to 1884 children who contracted COVID-19, had ED indexing data available, and completed a 90-day follow-up. The cohort was 52.8% male, and the average age was 3 years.\n\nThe investigators defined post-COVID-19 conditions as any persistent, new, or recurrent relevant health problems reported in the 90-day follow-up survey.\n\nUpon ED indexing, the most common symptoms were fever (65.9%), cought (48.7%), and rhinorrhea or congestion (47.4%).\n\nAfter 90 days, a total of 5.8% (n = 110) reported PCCs, including children who both were and were not hospitalized during acute illness. Among the children positive for COVID-19, the most common symptom was fatigue or weakness.\n\nThe factors most indicative of long COVID included being hospitalized for at least 48 hours (compared to the children who were not hospitalized at all), having 4 or more symptoms reported at the index ED visit (compared to 1-3 symptoms at indexing), and being 14 years or older (compared to children younger than 1 year).\n\nThe children who were still testing positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report long COVID symptoms at 90 days than the children who tested negative.\n\nThe investigators noted that guidance and follow-up are especially important for hospitalized children who are older and have multiple acute symptoms.\n\n\u201cReported rates of long COVID in adults are substantially higher than what we found in children,\u201d said Nathan Kuppermann, MD, MPH, a coprincipal investigator from the University of California Davis School of Medicine. \u201cOur findings can inform public health policy decisions regarding COVID-19 mitigation strategies for children and screening approaches for long COVID among those with severe infections.\u201d"

        "A Novel Device With COVID-19 Treatment Potential",
        "Medicine is always looking for novel ways to treat diseases and conditions, whether it be through agents, devices or some other unique modality. And this certainly applies to COVID-19. Aethlon Medical has developed its Hemopurifier, which is a therapeutic device designed for the single use depletion of circulating viruses and exosomes from the blood.\n\nThe San Diego, Calif.,-based medical technology company has been focusing on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. Specifically, when it comes to COVID-19, the company performed an in vitro study with its Hemopurifier, that was published in bioRxiv.\n\nIn their study, known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were passed 3 times over columns containing 1 gram of Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin. The percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. Extrapolation of these data would indicate that the binding capacity of the Hemopurifier for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection would be more than sufficient.\n\nThe Hemopurifier holds a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough device designation related to life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. In June 2020, the FDA approved an amendment to Aethlon's existing open IDE for the Hemopurifier in life threatening viral infections, to allow for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. This will allow for up to 40 of these patients to be treated under a new Early Feasibility Study protocol at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States.\n\nContagion recently spoke to Aethlon CEO Charles Fisher, Jr., MD, and Aethlon CMO Steven LaRosa, MD, who were the study\u2019s lead author and coauthor respectively. They provided an overview of the company, how the device works, and the study\u2019s findings."

        "SNG001: Synairgen's COVID-19 Antiviral for the Immunocompromised",
        "At more than 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant advances in treatment and prevention options. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is highly effective against severe disease and death, but highly infectious variants like Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are causing breakthrough infections, leading cases to rise once again.\n\nTo prevent older or otherwise immunocompromised people from severe or fatal infection, Synairgen is developing SNG001, an inhalable COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized persons.\n\nDr. Phillip Monk, the Chief Scientific Officer at Synairgen, joined Contagion to discuss the SNG001 trial data Synairgen presented at the American Thoracic Society 2022 International Conference, held in San Francisco last month.\n\nSNG001 is a formulation of Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), a naturally occurring protein that catalyzes the body\u2019s antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses this protein, so the inhalable IFN-\u03b2 directly targets the lungs, the primary site of the COVID-19 viral reservoir.\n\nSNG001 may retain some efficacy against the Omicron variant. As a host-directed antiviral, Monk says, SNG001 has \u201cbroad spectrum antiviral potential.\u201d \u201cWe have in the lab actually shown the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 against Omicron as we have against other variants\u201d\n\nThe phase 3 SPRINTER trial (SG018; NCT04732949) was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study. The trial evaluated inhaled SNG001 to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen. SPRINTER included 624 participants, randomly assigned to either SNG001 (n = 309) or placebo (n = 314) in addition to standard of care.\n\nIn February 2022, Synairgen announced that SPRINTER did not meet its primary endpoints of hospital discharge and illness recovery. Monk says that this can be partially attributed to the standard-of-care COVID-19 treatments improving so much that SNG001 had to demonstrate a greater significance of disease reduction. \u201cBecause patients are doing so much better, it\u2019s much more difficult to show treatment effect on things like hospital discharge,\u201d Mock explained.\n\nDespite the efficacy of vaccines and other antivirals, there are still COVID-19 mortalities. Monk says over 2000 patients are being hospitalized in the US each day, and about 200 people a day are dying of COVID-19.\n\nAmong the trial participants given SNG001, there was a signal in reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe disease or death within 35 days. Monk said that the greatest treatment benefits were observed in older patients, patients with comorbidities, and especially in people who had poor respiratory function at baseline.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are having to breathe faster or have low oxygen saturation despite being on oxygen,\u201d Monk said, noting that this treatment population saw a relative risk reduction of 70% for severe disease."

        "Episode 5: \u201cA Social and Political Pandemic\u201d: HIV Disparities in LGBTQ+ People",
        "Welcome back to Contagion\u2019s new podcast, Contagion Community, where we delve into some of the social factors that create and widen healthcare disparities.\n\nThis Pride month, Contagion Community is highlighting the healthcare needs and disparities unique to the LQBTQ+ community. Joining us for June\u2019s podcast are Steven Wolfe, DO, MPH, and Stuart A Fisk, CRNP, of the Allegheny Health Network (AHN).\n\nFisk and Wolfe work with LGBTQ people who are living with HIV. In this episode, they delve into the intersectionality of the disease, emphasizing that HIV prevention and treatment is especially needed for transgender people of color.\n\nWolfe and Fisk both identify as gay men, and thus have a personal as well as professional stake in ensuring LGBTQ+ people have access to comprehensive healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe need more physicians, like myself, out there who really understand what the community\u2019s needs are,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nAsked about the current state of the HIV epidemic, Wolfe said, \u201c62% of people who are trans and Black have HIV\u2026I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but I think that we need a lot more work when we\u2019re thinking about the minority populations.\u201d\n\nFisk added that 25-30% of people newly diagnosed with HIV are being diagnosed at the end stages of the disease. \u201cWe do not test people routinely for HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have the biomedical ability to end a pandemic as tragic as this one, and not do it because we\u2019re failing to give people a $2 test, is really a bad thing.\u201d\n\nBesides testing, Wolfe said pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another HIV preventative measure that is vastly underutilized. Wolfe cited study data suggesting 96% of transgender women were aware of PrEP, \u201cbut the reality of it is only 32% of transgender women were actually using PrEP to prevent HIV. That\u2019s a huge gap.\u201d\n\nFisk pointed out that similar disparities exist for injection drug users, who are at high risk of getting HIV but are \u201crarely if ever\u201d offered PrEP. \u201cPeople of color in general who have risk of HIV acquisition are typically not being offered PrEP or do not take PrEP.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is that HIV carries the stigma of the populations that it most impacts,\u201d Fisk said, noting that our society\u2019s criminalization of queerness, homelessness, and injection drug usage exacerbates HIV disease disparities. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nFisk has been working with marginalized people since the beginning of his nursing career, which he says has helped him become a better healthcare provider and a better human.\n\nWolfe noted that caring for people living with HIV is often not only about providing healthcare, but also mitigating the stigma these patients may have experienced throughout their lives. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe experts emphasized that HIV and LGBTQ+ healthcare should not be seen as specialized care. \u201cThis is care that should be integrated with regular primary care,\u201d Fisk said, with Wolfe adding, \u201cA transgender person should not have to go to an endocrinologist to get their hormones.\u201d\n\nAllegheny Health Network\u2019s Positive Health Clinic has 3 different locations in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania.

        "COVID-19 Antibodies After 1 and 2 Pfizer Vaccine Boosters",
        "COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, though still effective against severe or fatal disease, are known to wane over time. This is exacerbated by the emergence of new, highly infectious variants, such as Delta and Omicron.\n\nIn Israel, a fourth Pfizer-BioNTech shot was approved for persons 60 years and older after the efficacy of 3 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations (a 2-dose primary series and 1 booster shot) was deemed insufficient against Omicron.\n\nA JAMA study published today compared the immune response to a third and fourth Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine. The investigators evaluated the antispike (anti-S) immunoglobin G (IgG) antibody titers before and after each dose.\n\nThe cohort included 99 participants aged 60 years and older who received at least 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech; the average age was 70 years and the cohort was 61% female. Of the 99, 57 received an additional fourth dose. The population was considered at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease, and represented those first eligible for third and fourth Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses.\n\nThe investigators assessed the cohort\u2019s anti-S IgG titers before and 10-19 days after their third Pfizer-BioNTech dose, as well as before and 8-17 days after their fourth dose. Before the fourth dose, all participants were seropositive.\n\nAverage IgG titers significantly increased after the third dose (450 AU/mL before dose 3 and 27092 ~14 days after the dose) and after the fourth dose (3775 AU/mL before dose 4 and 28708 AU/mL ~11 days after the dose). There was no significant correlation between age and IgG titer after dose 4.\n\nOf the 57 participants who received 4 vaccine doses, 7% contracted COVID-19 (n = 4). Among those who received only 1 booster, 21% contracted COVID-19 (n = 9). All infections were asymptomatic to mild. There were no major adverse events reported.\n\nThis study found that in adults 60 years and older, a third and fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine safely and significantly increased anti-S IgG titers approximately 2 weeks after vaccination. The investigators noted that they did not examine the waning of immune response after the fourth dose, and thus further study should be done to determine whether subsequent boosters are required."

        "CDC Issues Health Advisory for Parechovirus in Infants",
        "Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory to inform the public that parechovirus is increasingly circulating in the United States.\n\nSince May 2022, the CDC has received reports of parechovirus (PeV) infections in young infants and neonates from multiple US states.\n\nParechoviruses are a group of viruses in the Picornaviridae family that cause a wide array of illness in humans. These common childhood pathogens are often associated with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness.\n\nSymptoms including upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and rash are common in children 6 months-5 years of age. Most children are naturally infected before they reach kindergarten age, but in infants under 3 months, sepsis-like illness, seizures, and meningitis may occur. These symptoms are particularly severe in infants younger than 1 month.\n\nStudies have revealed the spinal fluid of infants with PeV often has little to no white blood cell count. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, though rare, may also occur.\n\nAll PeV positive viral specimens were type PeV-A3, the type most often associated with severe disease. Because the CDC does not conduct systematic surveillance for PeVs, it is unknown how this year\u2019s reported PeV infections compare to previous years.\n\nThe virus can be transmitted even by asymptomatic individuals, typically by coming into contact with feces or via respiratory routes. Additionally, infected persons may be infectious for a long time, despite only experiencing symptoms for a few days. Shedding from the upper respiratory tract may occur for 1-3 weeks, and for up to 6 months from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThere is no specific recommended treatment for PeV infection. The CDC is recommending all healthcare providers test for PeV when infants present with indicative symptoms, including fever, sepsis-like syndrome, or signs of neurological impairment."

        "How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID-19?",
        "Key messages\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected.\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests.\n\nWhat are rapid point-of-care antigen tests for COVID-19?\n\nRapid point-of-care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection in people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. They:\n\n\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point-of-care) or in non-healthcare settings such as in the home;\n\n\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps;\n\n\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\n\n\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\n\n\u2022 provide results \u2018while you wait\u2019.\n\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \u2018lateral flow tests\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests.\n\nWhy is this question important?\n\nPeople with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result.\n\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID-19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point-of-care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe.\n\nMain results\n\nIn people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests).\n\nIn people who did not have COVID-19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms.\n\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \u2018acceptable\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID-19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms.\n\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID-19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID-19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT-PCR result as evidence of no COVID-19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT-PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT-PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT-PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self-isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people - individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected.\n\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID-19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non-healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021."

        "Are antibiotics an effective treatment for COVID-19 and do they cause unwanted effects?",
        "Key messages\n\n\u2022 The antibiotic azithromycin is not an effective treatment for COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t know whether antibiotics other than azithromycin are effective treatments for COVID-19 because there is not enough research.\n\n\u2022 We found 19 ongoing studies that are investigating antibiotics for COVID-19. We will update this review if their results change our conclusions.\n\nWhat are antibiotics?\n\nAntibiotics are cheap and common medicines used to treat bacterial infections. However, recent laboratory studies found that some antibiotics slowed the reproduction of some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In laboratory tests, one antibiotic, azithromycin, reduced viral activity and inflammation, and so it has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We need good evidence before giving antibiotics for COVID-19 because overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, where organisms that cause infection change, so that antibiotics stop working.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on:\n\n\u2022 people dying;\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;\n\n\u2022 unwanted effects;\n\n\u2022 heart rhythm problems;\n\n\u2022 quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients.\n\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only.\n\nSeven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment.\n\nWe found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published.\n\nMain results\n\nInpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19\n\nAzithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people).\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not:\n\n\u2022 worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or\n\n\u2022 improve patients\u2019 condition (3 studies, 8172 people);\n\n\u2022 increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people).\n\nAzithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people).\n\nNo studies looked at quality of life.\n\nOutpatients with mild COVID-19\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2022 people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people);\n\n\u2022 whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people).\n\nWe don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants).\n\nNo studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021."

        "Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19",
        "Is ivermectin effective for COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n\nWe found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited.\n\nEvaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.\n\nWhat is ivermectin?\n\nIvermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.\n\nMedical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID-19 is uncertain.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:\n\n\u2013 people dying;\n\n\u2013 whether people's COVID-19 got better or worse;\n\n\u2013 quality of life;\n\n\u2013 serious and non-serious unwanted effects;\n\n\u2013 viral clearance.\n\nFor prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\n\nIn this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo.\n\nFor treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.\n\nNo trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWe also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published.\n\nMain results\n\nTreating people in hospital with COVID-19\n\nWe do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment:\n\n\u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people);\n\n\u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);\n\n\u2013 increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).\n\nSeven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care.\n\nTreating outpatients with COVID-19\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);\n\n\u2013 serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants);\n\n\u2013 improving people's COVID\u201019 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);\n\n\u2013 number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021.

        "July 25, 2022\n\nexpert reaction to UKHSA updating the case definition for monkeypox, expanding the list of symptoms\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has expanded the list of symptoms for monkeypox.\n\nProf Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said:\n\n\u201cInfection control relies on accurate identification of cases, which in turn depends on clear definition of a potential case, so that anyone with suspect symptoms can seek a definite diagnosis and then receive appropriate clinical help and advice. The majority of monkeypox cases outside of Central and Western Africa are in gay, bisexual and other men having sex with men and the symptoms experienced in this group can be different to symptoms seen in other outbreaks. Therefore, extending the list of potential symptoms to reflect this will ensure that as many cases as possible can be identified and isolated, and their contacts traced to help bring the current outbreak to an end.\n\n\u201cIn the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, case definitions were woefully limited and this, together with poor testing capacity led to significant community spread.

        "expert reaction to WHO declaring the global monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)",
        "July 23, 2022\n\nexpert reaction to WHO declaring the global monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)\n\nAt the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting the Director-General determined that the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nDr Hugh Adler, Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said:\n\n\u201cI readily admit that I was wrong at the early stages of this outbreak, when I was confident this outbreak would be self-limiting and easily controlled with our available public health tools. The ongoing spread of MPX, facilitated by hitherto unappreciated modes of transmission and scenarios that prevent easy identification of contacts, has taken the global public health community by surprise.\n\nWhat is a public health emergency of international concern?\n\n\u201cThis declaration does not mean that MPX is a severe illness or causing high rates of mortality, nor does it mean that MPX meets the criteria for a pandemic. It does mean that this outbreak is extraordinary/unprecedented, that it is affecting multiple countries, and that a coordinated international response is required. It is interesting that the committee was so closely split regarding whether to declare a PHEIC or not \u2013 this reflects how different MPX is to previous PHEICs (for example, COVID-19 or the 2014 W African Ebola outbreak). Ultimately the third criterion in the PHEIC definition \u2013 requires a coordinated international response \u2013 is the crucial point here. Naming this a PHEIC adds political weight and urgency to this situation, to ensure that this outbreak can be prioritised when there are multiple competing priorities for governmental attention and funds. The WHO believes, as I do, that this outbreak is controllable (ie can be stopped from spreading extensively in the wider population) with public health measures including a concerted vaccination campaign, but that this window of opportunity is closing fast. Hence this declaration.\n\nWhy has it been called? What has changed since the last time it was discussed by the WHO?\n\n\u201cThe rate of spread of monkeypox has not slowed, and public health strategies have not shown a high rate of success. We have more data showing that MPX is presenting in atypical ways, that contact tracing is a massive challenge given the unique circumstances of this outbreak, and that countries are struggling to access vaccine supplies.\n\nHow concerning is this development?\n\n\u201cI think it is a positive development if it succeeds in its intended aim \u2013 to raise the political priority of this outbreak, step up the production and supply of vaccines and ensure that vaccines are made available where they are most needed. We have seen how countries can get embroiled in unseemly squabbles over vaccine access, and a key challenge for the WHO will be whether it can moderate such disputes and ensure equitable access. The WHO also noted that MPX continues to circulate in West and Central Africa, with a far higher mortality rate reported in Nigeria than in high-income countries, and these nations need just as much support.\n\nWhat changes now it is a public health emergency of international concern?\n\n\u201cAs above. This hinges on how relevant and weighty a WHO declaration is perceived by governments, public bodies and vaccine manufacturers/suppliers, as well as people at risk of monkeypox around the world. Will these words on a page speed up the supply of vaccines and make them available in primary care/sexual health clinics for people at high risk of MPX? Will people at risk of MPX (mainly GBMSM with multiple partners, at this point in time) present for vaccination? Can we devise novel ways to rapidly identify high-risk contacts of MPX cases in time for them to be vaccinated? Will public discourse be free from stigma?\u201d\n\nProf Piero Olliaro, Professor of Infectious Diseases of Poverty, University of Oxford, said:\n\n\u201cWe are in a sort of paradoxical situation with monkeypox.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand our knowledge of the clinical presentation and outcomes of monkeypox in the Western world is improving, and we even have potentially one or more treatments and a vaccine, on the other hand we still have little evidence to support which intervention should be used and how to break the chains of transmission and how to effectively manage cases. This because evidence of clinical benefits and public health gains of using these drugs and vaccine has yet to be produced \u2013 tecovirimat and vaccine are registered without clinical data.\n\n\u201cBetween these uncertainties and the high prices reportedly charged, drug and vaccine supplies are very limited, even in the countries where products are registered.\n\n\u201cSo, the hope is that, whether though a PHEIC status or other means, the sense of priority and urgency is raised for governments to not only negotiate procurement with manufacturers, but, importantly, invest into the necessary research to answer those questions and gather evidence of patient-centered and/or public health gains, and cost-effectiveness of using these interventions (drug, vaccine, etc.). These questions can be addressed through a combination of observational studies and randomized controlled trials \u2013 which are already at least in part underway, but need funding.\u201d\n\nDr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, said:\n\n\u201cI welcome the decision of the WHO Director to declare the current global monkeypox outbreak a PHEIC. For several weeks now the criteria for making monkeypox a PHEIC had been met. It is \u201can extraordinary event which constitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and potentially requires a coordinated international response\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that this will raise the international priority level on monkeypox and galvanize a more coordinated global response which has sadly been lacking so far. It is also an opportunity to get things right on global health equity and access to resources such as testing, vaccination, antiviral medications etc. which are areas in which historically we have seen many failures, resulting in countries with limited resources being left behind.\n\n\u201cHaving another zoonotic virus infection firmly establish itself in the human population is not something we can allow and must do everything within our power to prevent this from happening. The PHEIC is just the first step and there is a lot of work that needs to be done here onwards, it is nonetheless and important move which hopefully corrects the course of the response to this emerging pandemic.\u201d\n\nProf Jimmy Whitworth, Emeritus Professor, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said:\n\n\u201cA Public Health Emergency of International Concern is the highest level of alert that WHO can declare.\n\n\u201cThis has been declared because the current monkeypox outbreak is unprecedented with widespread cases occurring in many countries, and would benefit from increased attention and co-ordination.\n\n\u201cSince the last meeting in June the outbreak has continued to expand in terms of number of cases and countries involved, indicating that the control measures that have put in place have not been sufficient to control the spread of the infection.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak is concerning for public health practitioners around the world as it has proved very challenging to prevent onward transmission of infection, but it is not a situation that should unduly worry the general public. This is an infection that is transmitted by close contact \u2013 touching skin, coughing and sneezing, sharing of utensils, bedding and so on. The vast majority of cases have been in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men who have had multiple recent sexual partners. Most people, whatever their sexual orientation, do not have close contact of this sort with many people and so the infection is unlikely to spread easily.\n\n\u201cIt is to be hoped that the increased attention to this disease leads to more focus on control within Africa, the natural home of this virus, where the number of cases has been increasing for the past 20 years.\u201d\n\nTweets from the WHO\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WHO/status/1550845488148144128\n\nSecond meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee regarding the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news/item/23-07-2022-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox\n\nDeclared interests\n\nDr Hugh Adler: \u201cNo conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nDr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji: \u201cI have no conflicts of interest to declare.\u201d\n\nProf Jimmy Whitworth: \u201cNo conflicts to declare.\u201d\n\nFor all other experts, no reply to our request for DOIs was received."

The data taken between January 2020 and April 2021 comprised of 486,149 people with prior infection, and 1.9 million people with no indication of coronavirus infection after matching for other clinical diagnoses.\n\nUsing only non-hospitalised patients, the team of researchers were able to identify three categories of distinct symptoms reported by people with persistent health problems after infection.\n\nPatterns of symptoms tended to be grouped into respiratory symptoms, mental health and cognitive problems, and then a broader range of symptoms. While the most common symptoms include anosmia (loss of sense of smell), shortness of breath, chest pain and fever; others include:\n\namnesia,\n\napraxia (inability to perform familiar movements or commands),\n\nbowel incontinence,\n\nerectile dysfunction,\n\nhallucinations,\n\nlimb swelling\n\nDr Shamil Haroon, Associate Clinical Professor in Public Health at the University of Birmingham is the senior author on the study. Dr Haroon said:\n\n\u201cThis research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of Long Covid are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe symptoms we identified should help clinicians and clinical guideline developers to improve the assessment of patients with long-term effects from Covid-19, and to subsequently consider how this symptom burden can be best managed.\u201d\n\nPatient partner and co-author of this study Jennifer Camaradou said:\n\n\u201cThis study is instrumental in creating and adding further value to understanding the complexity and pathology of long COVID. It highlights the degree and diversity of expression of symptoms between different clusters. Patients with pre-existing health conditions will also welcome the additional analysis on risk factors.\u201d\n\nSeveral other patient partners involved in the therapies for long COVID (TLC) study have expressed their views on living with long COVID, accessible at:\n\nhttps://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/applied-health/research/long-covid/index.aspx?pageindex=0\n\nAs well as identifying a wider set of symptoms, the research team also found key demographic groups and behaviours which put people at increased risk of developing Long Covid.\n\nThe study suggests that females, younger people; or belonging to a black, mixed or other ethnic group are at greater risk of developing Long Covid. In addition, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, smokers, people who are overweight or obese, as well as the presence of a wide range of health conditions were associated with reporting persistent symptoms.\n\nAnuradhaa Subramanian, Research Fellow at the Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham and lead author of the paper said:\n\n\u201cOur data analyses of risk factors are of particular interest because it helps us to consider what could potentially be causing or contributing to Long Covid. We already know that certain modifiable traits such as smoking and obesity put people at increased risk of various diseases and conditions, including Long Covid. However, others such as biological sex and ethnicity also appear to be important.\n\n\u201cWomen are for example more likely to experience autoimmune diseases. Seeing the increased likelihood of women having Long Covid in our study increases our interest in investigating whether autoimmunity or other causes may explain the increased risk in women. These observations will help to further narrow the focus on factors to investigate that may be causing these persistent symptoms after an infection, and how we can help patients who are experiencing them.\u201d\n\nPatient records for 2.3m people enabled the research team to capture post SARS-CoV-2 infections at a unique point in the global pandemic. The study focuses on the first phase of the pandemic in the UK between January 2020 and April 2021 and provided the team with an opportunity to compare meaningful numbers of people who had coronavirus infections alongside a control group of uninfected people.\n\nThe interdisciplinary team involved epidemiologists, clinicians, data scientists, statisticians, and patients to decode electronic health records to accurately capture persistent symptoms experienced after infection.\n\nDr Shamil Haroon said:\n\n\u201cThe results are both a testament to the opportunities that these public health datasets provide, and to the power of collaborative work to provide much needed evidence around the experiences of many people who have been affected by persistent symptoms after infection with the coronavirus. I hope our research will also further validate the voices of patients and involvement groups and provide an approach to support healthcare responses to new and emerging diseases.\u201d\n\nENDS\n\nFor media enquiries please contact Tim Mayo, Press Office, University of Birmingham, tel: +44 (0)7920 405040: email: t.mayo@bham.ac.uk\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\nAbout the University of Birmingham\n\nThe University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world\u2019s top 100 institutions.

        "Monkeypox is a global health emergency Are we about to have a new pandemic soon?",
        "The number of monkeypox cases reported in the US has tripled in the past 3 weeks and globally, the growth is almost exponential. Researchers say we\u2019re doing too little to contain it and the World Health Organization has now declared monkeypox a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)\u201d \u2014 a move meant to ignite international cooperation to contain the disease. But many fear that containment is no longer an option.\n\nColorized transmission electron micrograph of monkeypox virus particles (gold) cultivated and purified from cell culture. Image captured at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Credit: NIAID.\n\nFor most people, monkeypox was a virtually unknown virus until two months ago. The virus, endemic to West and Central Africa, seemed to come out of nowhere. Europe and the Americas quickly moved from zero cases of monkeypox per year to hundreds, and now thousands of cases \u2014 and probably, plenty more undetected.\n\nAs many were quick to point out, this isn\u2019t another COVID-19. The disease is different, it\u2019s less contagious, and it\u2019s not new. We already have a vaccine for monkeypox, that, in a worst-case scenario, could be deployed to help the most vulnerable while production and distribution are scaled up.\n\nThe disease is also less dangerous than COVID-19. The case fatality rate is currently less than one death for every 1,000 adult cases. While this may change if more vulnerable segments of the population become infected, it\u2019s still significantly less severe.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a problem.\n\nThe growth and spread of the disease has been relentless. In the first stage, the disease seemed to spread more to LGBT+ community. But as the US reported its first cases in children and there\u2019s already community transmission in several states, this no longer seems to be the case. A large part of the problem is people assuming monkepox is a sexually transmitted virus. It is not. The virus isn\u2019t airborne, fortunately, but it is transmitted by close contact with the lesions of an infected person. So, while sexual contact contributes greatly to spread, it\u2019s not a requirement for infection.\n\n30) Will the @WHO act finally to declare #monkeypox a public health emergency (PHEIC) finally? I agree with @LawrenceGostin that the window for containment is rapidly closing or already closed\u2026 we have already likely passed the point of no return for stopping pandemic scale. https://t.co/DtKGFHY5iX \u2014 Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) July 20, 2022\n\nInitially, the WHO did not want to declare monkeypox a global emergency. Even now, the votes were split, with nine members against and six in favor of the declaration, prompting WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to break the deadlock. Tedros emphasized that the disease is still spreading predominantly among members of one community, but by declaring it an emergency, he emphasizes the importance of immediate action.\n\n\u201cAlthough I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,\u201d Tedros told a media briefing in Geneva. \u201cStigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus,\u201d he added.\n\nLawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law in Washington, D.C., told Reuters the decision is \u201cpolitically brave\u201d and that not issuing the declaration would have been a historic mistake. His feelings were echoed by experts including Josie Golding, head of epidemics and epidemiology at the Wellcome Trust, who said we can\u2019t \u201cafford to wait\u201d for this.\n\nWhile most cases are mild, monkeypox is nothing to ignore. It can cause painful, pus-filled blisters and lesions on the skin, as well as fever, swollen lymph nodes, and flu-like symptoms. The virus isn\u2019t airborne, but it\u2019s not transmitted exclusively through sex \u2014 it can be transmitted by close contact, especially skin-to-skin contact.\n\nChildren with monkeypox, such as this four-year-old girl, are at increased risk of severe disease. Image credits: CDC.\n\nThere are currently only three Public Health Emergencies of International Concern: COVID-19, polio, and monkeypox. Since 2009, only four other emergencies have been declared: 2009 H1N1 (or swine flu) pandemic, the 2013\u20132016 outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa, the 2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic, and the 2018\u201320 Kivu Ebola epidemic. This puts monkeypox in a very \u201cselect\u201d club.\n\nThe PHEIC can be regarded as an \u201calarm system\u201d or a \u201ccall to action\u201d, but also as a \u201clast resort\u201d measure. It\u2019s the last call before things get really out of control.\n\nExperts have mixed opinions on whether the outbreak can be contained or not -- the latter would mean the disease may become endemic and may reach epidemic level, or even worse.\n\nResearchers are also worried that the disease may become stigmatized, somewhat akin to how HIV became stigmatized. This is a disease that can threaten everyone, and with such low levels of testing, it's hard to even know how the disease is spreading.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fExponential surge to almost 13,000 #monkeypox cases globally\u2014with no signs of slowing\u2014on track to hit 100,000 in August \ud83d\udc40(per earlier forecast).

Vaccination eradicated smallpox, and vaccination against smallpox was stopped. Researchers at the Pasteur Institute have found that, because the two diseases were related, smallpox vaccination also offered some protection against monkeypox.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThankfully, we know how to stop viruses like monkeypox -- at least in theory.\n\nSorry to interrupt, but you should really... ...Join the ZME newsletter for amazing science news, features, and exclusive scoops.

Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\n\"Fortunately, unlike Covid, poxviruses including monkeypox are a well-known entity. Taking lessons from the 20-year global smallpox eradication campaign we know how to stop the spread of monkeypox,\" explains Jason Mercer Professor of Virus Cell Biology at the University of Birmingham.\n\nBut whether or not we will actually be capable of doing so (and doing so quickly, before things get out of hand) is a different problem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn several parts of the US, people have queued for hours to get a monkeypox vaccine, and the UK is also ordering more vaccines to keep up with demand. A global, large-scale vaccination effort is currently not even on the table, however, and it's likely only the rich countries that will have access to vaccines.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, we had no vaccine, and a very poor understanding of the virus. Thanks to gargantuan scientific and social efforts, we've gained some level of control over it -- although new strains keep emerging, becoming more severe, more contagious, and more capable of escaping vaccines. With monkeypox, we're in a much better situation. Researchers have a decent understanding of the virus, it's less contagious, less severe, and we already have a vaccine for it. But we've seen how quickly things can degenerate if we get complacent. The monkeypox outbreak comes on top of COVID-19, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the threat of economic recession, and all the shortages and other problems the world is currently facing (many of which can be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nThe World Health Organization is likely right to consider monkeypox an emergency. Whether or not that will trigger action remains to be seen."

        "What Is Parechovirus?",
        "Key Takeaways The CDC has issued a health alert to warn parents and doctors about parechovirus.\n\nMultiple reports of cases in children ages 6 months to 5 years have been received since May 2022.\n\nMost cases concern the PeV-A3 strain, which is most commonly associated with severe disease.\n\nPossible symptoms include fever, rash, and respiratory tract infection.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning parents and healthcare providers to be on alert for Parechovirus (PeV), which may cause serious illness in babies and young children.\n\nParechovirus isn't a virus most people are familiar with, but since May, the CDC has received reports of infection from healthcare providers in several states. The CDC is appealing to doctors, nurses, and public health professionals to consider it as a diagnosis for any infants displaying unexplained fever, seizures, or sepsis-like symptoms.\n\n\"Parechovirus is part of the picornaviruses family and is not an uncommon virus in childhood,\" explains Lisa Hoang, MD, a pediatrician with Providence Mission Hospital in Orange County, California.\n\nThere are several different strains of parechovirus. The CDC says most of the reported cases are of the PeV-A3 strain, which is most commonly associated with severe disease. However, the alert doesn't reveal which states reported infections or whether there have been any deaths associated with the virus. Nor is it clear how the number of PeV cases reported in 2022 compares to previous seasons.\n\n\n\nHere's some reassurance: PeV is so common that most children have been infected with it by the time they start kindergarten. So your child might have had it and you didn't even realize it.\n\n\n\nKelly Fradin, MD, FAAP The alert is intended to ensure that health care providers are aware and obtaining appropriate testing for very sick children. \u2014 Kelly Fradin, MD, FAAP\n\nWhat Are The Symptoms of Parechovirus?\n\nIn most cases, PeV is no different from any other typical childhood infection, causing cough, runny nose, diarrhea, fever, and rash, says pediatrician Florencia Segura, MD, Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics (FAAP).\n\nHowever, if you have a newborn at home who stops feeding, has a fever, low tone, or abnormal movements that could signal a seizure, you should get in touch with your healthcare provider immediately. These could be symptoms of severe parechovirus illness.\n\nThe CDC says the incubation period (the number of days between when a person is infected and when they might see symptoms) for PeV is unknown.\n\n\n\nTreating Babies With Parechovirus\n\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine for parechovirus, says Dr. Hoang. For mild symptoms, the best combination is rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen. Remember not to give aspirin to children under 12 unless your doctor gives you the green light, though.\n\nWhile young babies or children with severe PeV symptoms will need to be hospitalized, most of them get better within a few days under medical care.\n\nIf your child has PeV, keep a close eye on them, looking out for drowsiness, or floppiness. If you\u2019re not able to easily wake them up, call 911 or head to your nearest hospital without delay.\n\n\"For infants younger than 3 months of age, parents should seek medical care for a fever, no matter the suspected cause,\" Dr. Hoang adds.\n\nShould Parents Be Concerned About Parechovirus?\n\nDr. Segura welcomes the CDC health alert warning against parechovirus. \"It is not one of the most common illnesses we typically think about when we have an ill newborn,\" she says. \"This alert is essential so that clinicians consider it a possible diagnosis for any baby with unexplained fever, sepsis, or meningitis.\"\n\nThe alert is also timely, Dr. Segura adds, given that parechoviruses circulate primarily in the summer and fall months.\n\nFlorencia Segura, MD, FAAP Newborns have an immature immune system with little to no preexisting immunological memory, therefore safeguards such as frequent hand washing and limiting visits with anyone unwell, including children in daycare and school, are important. \u2014 Florencia Segura, MD, FAAP\n\nKelly Fradin, MD, a pediatrician and author of Parenting in a Pandemic: How to Help Your Family Through COVID-19, is also glad that the CDC health alert is drawing attention to the children who have been ill with parechovirus. She says it may protect potentially vulnerable children\u2014particularly in hospital settings\u2014from being exposed. However, she doesn't consider it to be a new threat or a surge situation.\n\n\"I suspect that part of why we see an increase in cases of parechovirus is because of increased viral testing,\" Dr. Fradin says. Her advice is to try not to worry. \"The alert is intended to ensure that health care providers are aware and obtaining appropriate testing for very sick children,\" she explains.\n\n\n\nHow to Prevent Parechovirus\n\nThe CDC alert is a good reminder that parents with a baby under three months should continue to take the precautions doctors advise when they have a newborn in the home.\n\n\"Newborns have an immature immune system with little to no preexisting immunological memory, therefore safeguards such as frequent hand washing and limiting visits with anyone unwell, including children in daycare and school, are important,\" Dr. Segura says.\n\nSince parechovirus spreads through contact via stool and saliva or the respiratory route via cough, the best way to keep infants safe is to continue with the usual COVID-19 precautions.\n\n\"Wash hands with soap and water, avoid crowded indoor places those first couple of months, avoid unnecessary travel, and even consider visitors wearing a mask,\" advises Dr. Segura.\n\nNaturally, it can get a little more complicated when you have a toddler or a child going to school. \"Some parents will keep those children home for the first couple weeks when their newborn is born,\" says Dr. Segura. If this isn't possible, be vigilant about hand washing, instruct other kids not to touch the baby's face or hands, and have siblings keep some distance if they are sick.\n\n\n\n\"Pediatricians always counsel about protecting infants younger than 2 to 3 months from viral illnesses,\" says Dr. Fradin. \"Unfortunately babies, because of their immature systems, are more vulnerable to everyday viruses like RSV, influenza, whooping cough, and parechovirus too. Parents should always be mindful of keeping sick people away from small babies.\"\n\n"

        "Can Kids Get COVID-19 More Than Once?",
        "Key Takeaways It is possible to get COVID-19 more than once.\n\nKids may be at risk for reinfection because they are in close proximity at school.\n\nContinuing to follow basic COVID-19 protocols and getting vaccinated can reduce the risk of reinfection.\n\nWhen Christine and her husband came down with COVID-19 during the Omnicron surge, they were obviously not too thrilled about having to be sick and put their lives on hold. But they were comforted by the fact that their 12-year-old twins, Ryan and Madison, had already been infected eight weeks prior. At least they would be okay, they thought. Until Ryan started showing symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe immediately called the pediatrician who initially said it was unlikely for him to have COVID-19 again so quickly,\u201d Christine recalls. \u201cBut his test came back positive. He had it again.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 reinfection is definitely possible and there are a few reasons why we are starting to see more kids testing positive two or even three times.\n\n\u201cThe virus wants to evolve so that it can survive,\u201d explains Ilan Shapiro, MD, FAAP, FACHE, chief health correspondent and medical affairs officer at AltaMed Health Services and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \u201cWe are seeing it evolve to be more infectious and contagious. It can outsmart our immune system, leading to reinfection.\u201d\n\nIlan Shapiro, MD, FAAP, FACHE We are seeing [COVID-19] evolve to be more infectious and contagious. It can outsmart our immune system, leading to reinfection. \u2014 Ilan Shapiro, MD, FAAP, FACHE\n\nWhy Are Kids Getting Reinfected?\n\nReinfection isn\u2019t necessarily specific to children, but there are a few reasons why it may be more common in kids.\n\nMany children were not exposed to the original version of the virus at the start of the pandemic. They may have been under a strict lockdown and some were not even born yet. So their bodies may not have built up the same immunity that adults going to work and grocery shopping may have.\n\nWhile kids may have had less exposure early on, they may have more chances to become infected now that schools are open. \u201cKids are in close proximity in classrooms and a lot of schools are no longer asking them to wear a mask,\u201d notes Dr. Shapiro.\n\nLower vaccination rates may also contribute to more reinfection in children.\n\nHow Common Is Reinfection in Children?\n\nFortunately, reinfection is not particularly common in children, though it is possible. Research indicates that kids have a much higher immune response to COVID-19 than adults, which would presumably make reinfection less likely.\n\nHow Soon Can My Child Get COVID-19 Again?\n\nThe exact time when reinfection becomes possible will vary from person to person, but generally, a COVID-19 infection will offer immunity for three to five months before that immunity begins to wane. Being vaccinated adds another layer of protection by further boosting immunity.\n\nIn Ryan's case, it only took eight weeks. \"Our first thought when he became symptomatic shortly after we tested positive was 'No way can he have COVID-19 again so quickly!' because we felt like he just had it,\" says Christine. \"The pediatrician really had no insight on why he tested positive again so quickly, but did mention that it had to be a different variant the second time.\"\n\n\n\nDo Variants Like BA.5 Play A Role in Reinfection?\n\nImmunity fades over time, but the virus also changes and evolves. This is why we are seeing variants, including the latest, BA.5. Even if your immunity is still strong for a previous version of the virus, your body may not recognize or be prepared to fight the latest variant. The BA.5 variant is highly transmissible, and appears to be better at sidestepping prior immunity from infections and vaccines, meaning it has an increased ability to reinfect people.\n\nShould I Be Concerned If My Child Is Reinfected?\n\nIf your kids get COVID-19 more than once, it does not mean that anything is wrong with them. \u201cBecoming infected is not a sign of a weak immune system,\u201d says Dr. Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the virus adapting to us and trying to jump from one person to another in a better and more efficient way.\u201d\n\nThere is not currently enough data to know whether multiple infections have any long-term negative effects. Becoming reinfected does increase the risk of long-haul COVID-19 or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), but that is only because the additional infections provide another chance for these conditions to develop.\n\n\n\nPreventing COVID-19 Reinfection in Children\n\nIf your child is age 6 months or older, getting vaccinated will reduce the chance of reinfection.\n\nOn top of vaccination, the best way to prevent reinfection in children is to continue teaching them protocols that reduce the virus\u2019s chance of entering their bodies. Unfortunately, we can't assume that a prior infection will prevent our kids from testing positive for COVID-19 a second or third time. Although it makes it less likely and symptoms tend to be milder in those who are vaccinated.\n\nAs tired as we are all getting of hearing how can prevent COVID-19, the same basic rules do apply. Emphasize hand washing and have your kids do outdoor activities whenever possible. In situations where kids will be in close proximity to one another and indoors, consider having them wear a mask.\n\n\u201cThis virus is giving us a lot of surprises, so it is important to make sure that we are creating as many barriers as we can,\u201d says Dr. Shapiro. \u201cWe want to make it a little more difficult for the virus to jump from one person to another.\u201d\n\nAfter her son's reinfection, Christine says she is quicker to reach for a test kit if anyone in her family is not feeling well. The family continues to be especially vigilant about large gatherings. \"Ryan definitely gets a bit nervous when he is not feeling well, but keeps a good sense of humor about it,\" she says. Luckily, no one in her household has gotten COVID-19 since.\n\n\n\n\n\nIlan Shapiro, MD, FAAP, FACHE This virus is giving us a lot of surprises, so it is important to make sure that we are creating as many barriers as we can. \u2014 Ilan Shapiro, MD, FAAP, FACHE"

        "Omicron's Latest Strain: How BA.5 Affects Your Children",
        "Key Takeaways The BA.5 variant (along with its cousin, BA.4) currently makes up 80% of cases in the U.S. and is causing a rise in COVID-19 cases.\n\nBA.5 is more likely than other variants to cause reinfections, including in children.\n\nExperts agree that vaccines continue to prevent severe outcomes of COVID-19 in children, and recommend children ages 6 months and up be vaccinated.\n\nThe United States is experiencing yet another period of high COVID-19 prevalence. This current spike is being mostly driven by the BA.5 variant of Omicron. According to The White House COVID-19 Response Team, as of July 12th, the BA.4 and BA.5 variants made up 80% of the current COVID-19 cases, with BA.5 causing the bulk of infection.\n\nThe White House\u2019s COVID-19 Response Team is warning that infections are rising and will continue to rise as we ride out this wave. Besides increased transmissibility, the BA.5 variant appears to be better at sidestepping prior immunity from infections and vaccines, meaning it has an increased ability to reinfect people, which may contribute to a higher infection rate.\n\nParents might be wondering what this new spike in infections will mean for their children. Experts help us break it all down for you.\n\nWhat Symptoms of BA.5 Should I Look Out For?\n\nThe symptoms of BA.5 are similar to what we've generally seen with COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, which has caused milder illness in most cases than prior variants of COVID-19. \u201cCOVID-19 symptoms can be slightly different for all patients,\u201d reminds Gemma Downham, MPH, epidemiologist and corporate director, infection prevention, at AtlantiCare. \u201cHowever, common symptoms we are seeing with the currently circulating variants include headache, body aches, especially back and neck, fever, and fatigue.\u201d\n\nVidya Mony, DO, pediatric infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, says in general, pediatricians are seeing fewer asymptomatic infections with the BA.5 variant as opposed to other Omicron variants. \u201cWe are seeing more fevers, sore throat, cough, runny nose, fatigue, and headache with this variant,\u201d she says. As infections increase, pediatric hospitalizations are going up, says Dr. Mony, but it\u2019s only been a slight increase, which is reassuring.\n\n\n\nHow Dangerous is BA.5 For Children?\n\nParents can take heart in knowing children generally don\u2019t get very sick with COVID-19 and that should continue with this variant, says Anu Seshadri, MD, internist, pediatrician, and Plus Life Media's medical correspondent. That may also mean it can be easier to brush off COVID-19 symptoms and neglect to test or isolate your child.\n\n\u201cRemember, children have milder symptoms most of the time compared to adults,\u201d says Dr. Seshadri. \u201cFor example, they may have just a runny nose or they may have decreased appetite because they have a sore throat,\u201d she describes. She wants parents to remember if there\u2019s any suspicion of COVID-19, they should get their child tested.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember although most children will experience a mild case of BA.5, as infections rise, the virus will reach more vulnerable children, including immunocompromised children and those with underlying conditions. For them, the virus may not be so mild, explains Downham. Thankfully, she says, vaccinations have been shown to be effective at preventing the most severe cases in children and offer important protection during this wave.\n\nDr. Mony agrees. She warns that this variant may be able to reinfect children at a higher rate than other variants, but that the majority of children who are getting sick enough to require hospital care are either high-risk or unvaccinated.\n\n\n\nHow Will BA.5 Affect Daycare, Camp, and School?\n\nBesides concerns about infection, many parents could be worried about what the BA.5 surge may mean for their children\u2019s various activities, such as daycare, camp, and school. Many parents have endured daycare/school closures and seemingly endless quarantines over the past few years. It\u2019s been extremely disruptive and stressful for parents and children.\n\nFortunately, Dr. Seshadri doesn\u2019t expect this wave will lead to as many closures as prior waves. \u201cI do not think that schools, camps, daycares will be closed as this is still a milder variant, but wearing masks while in crowded spaces/indoors and increasing hygienic measures may be implemented,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for whether mask mandates will return in light of this wave, experts agree this may happen in certain areas, but it\u2019s unlikely to happen on a large scale. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to state if mask mandates will come back,\u201d says Dr. Mony. \u201cOne would think that since the test positivity is so high in the community right now that we would bring back the mandates, but there is also a lot of mask fatigue/Covid fatigue.\u201d\n\nDr. Mony explains that it will be up to each state and local health department to decide what\u2019s best in terms of masking mandates and recommendations.\n\n\n\nHow Can I Protect My Family from BA.5?\n\n\u201cThe best way to prevent illness with BA.5 is to make sure that everyone in your family is up to date with CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccines including booster shots,\u201d says Downham. The COVID-19 vaccines have a strong track record of protecting children against severe cases of COVID-19 and are now approved and available for children aged 6 months and up. Children aged 5 and up can receive booster shots five months after they\u2019ve completed their initial vaccine series.\n\nEveryone needs to weigh their own personal risk as well as pay attention to local health advisories. During times of high transmission, it may make sense to wear masks in crowded indoor settings, says Downham. \u201cAttending a large indoor wedding or concert, for example, increases chances of exposure during times of high community transmission,\u201d she says. \u201cTo mitigate the risk, attendees could wear masks when indoors and in crowded settings.\u201d\n\n"

        "Why You Should Probably Get a COVID-19 Vaccine Even if You've Already Had the Disease",
        "A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts.\n\nMost people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well.\n\nThere are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past.\n\n\"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed.\n\nSo how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds.\n\nIt's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version.\n\nNussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days.\n\n\"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai.\n\nWhy a vaccine could be better than nature\n\nIf it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection?\n\nA few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems.\n\n\"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nOne example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s.\n\nIn contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections.\n\nCOVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say.\n\nMany of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein.\n\n\"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty.\n\nMany vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects.\n\nEven with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots.\n\nThat may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day.\n\n\"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai."

        "Ethical Anguish in a Time of COVID-19",
        "Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic.\n\nJoel Shurkin, Contributor\n\n(Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe.\n\nThe Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S.\n\nItaly\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone.\n\nIn a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum.\n\nThe pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy.\n\nItalians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified.\n\nAbout three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region.\n\nAs of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died.\n\nIn mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone.\n\nVentilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques.\n\nIn one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing.\n\nFifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment.\n\nThe use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die.\n\nTriage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited.\n\nWhat the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention.\n\n\u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d\n\nOne way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines.\n\nThe allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better.\n\nIn American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan.\n\nResearchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision.\n\nWho is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician.\n\nThese kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world.\n\nYet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel. American doctors will likely face the same agonizing choices that have been necessary in other countries facing the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of educational webinars with residents, medical students, staff, ICU directors,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going on everywhere around the country. I know many hospitals are scrambling to put together policies and committees. I think we're a little ahead of the game at NYU, partly because we\u2019re a hospital of last resort.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any hospital is fully prepared. I think planning was just inadequate.\u201d\n\nSpain is now catching up to Italy with cases. \u201cAnd so,\" Cereda said, \u201care we.\u201d"

        "How Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19",
        "The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past.\n\nA German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system.\n\nNext week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic.\n\nDiscovering antibodies\n\nEmil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin.\n\nVon Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production.\n\n\"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908.\n\nImage Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory. Media credits The Wellcome Collection Media rights CC BY 4.0\n\nVon Behring and Ehrlich's anti-diphtheria serum, known as diphtheria antitoxin, is essentially the same idea as the convalescent plasma being explored as a treatment for Covid-19. The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans.\n\n\"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization.\n\nWhile diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria.\n\nDiphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand.\n\nAfter developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies.\n\nVon Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19.\n\nAntibodies as tools\n\nAntibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body.\n\nBut many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products.\n\nC\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984.\n\n\"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.)\n\nMany new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals.\n\nResearchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways.\n\nKiller T cells\n\nWhile antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells.\n\nViruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target.\n\n\"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\"\n\nImage A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0\n\nBy the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty.\n\nWith colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body.\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells.\n\nDoherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\"\n\nMost vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place.\n\nBut respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems.\n\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms.\n\nThere is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses.\n\nThere are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat.\n\n\"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\""

        "Why You Should Probably Get a COVID-19 Vaccine Even if You've Already Had the Disease",
        "A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts.\n\nMost people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well.\n\nThere are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past.\n\n\"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed.\n\nSo how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds.\n\nIt's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version.\n\nNussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days.\n\n\"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai.\n\nWhy a vaccine could be better than nature\n\nIf it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection?\n\nA few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems.\n\n\"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nOne example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s.\n\nIn contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections.\n\nCOVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say.\n\nMany of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein.\n\n\"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty.\n\nMany vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects.\n\nEven with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots.\n\nThat may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day.\n\n\"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai."

        "What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 testing",
        "AMA News Wire What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 testing\n\nWith masks going away and more people going back to work in offices, it has left many people wondering whether their symptoms are allergies, COVID-19 or just the common cold. Yet knowing the ins and outs of COVID-19 has been difficult to navigate, especially when new guidance to follow leaves even the most diligent person feeling lost. As the United States continues to search for a new normal, questions linger about COVID-19 and what role testing continues to play.\n\nAdvancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA\n\nThe AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this installment, AMA member Emily Volk, MD, president of the College of American Pathologists and chief medical officer at Baptist Health Floyd in metropolitan Louisville, discusses what patients need to know about ongoing COVID-19 testing as the country tries to obtain a \u201cnew normal.\u201d Dr. Volk is also an associate professor of pathology at the University of Louisville School of Medicine.\n\nAt-home tests require care At-home tests require care\n\nDr. Volk frequently gets asked about when the at-home test is a better choice than a hospital laboratory or reference laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which detects the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nA COVID-19 \u201cat-home test is an antigen-based test. It is not as sensitive or specific, meaning it doesn\u2019t work quite as well as the PCR test done in a laboratory,\u201d Dr. Volk explained. \u201cHowever, its convenience factor makes up for a lot of its deficiencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that you can actually test yourself and get a reasonably accurate result within about 20 minutes can be very, very powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, though, if you use those tests at home, that you treat them with the respect that they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing a COVID-19 test at home, make sure you are actually reading the instructions, paying full attention, taking away any distractions\u2014the doorbell ringing, your phone beeping and so on\u2014and give this your full attention,\u201d Dr. Volk said.\n\nAMA COVID-19 Update What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 testing with Emily Volk, MD, FCAP\n\nTesting helps sort out symptoms Testing helps sort out symptoms\n\n\u201cIt is important to use these tests in a way that will be impactful,\u201d said Dr. Volk. For example, \u201ctesting yourself after you've been in a high-risk situation can be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the tests are more accurate for patients who are symptomatic, it can be helpful to try to sort out the difference between\u2014do I have seasonal allergies, do I have a common cold or do I have COVID-19?\u201d she said. \u201cThat at-home test can be helpful in that situation.\u201d\n\nTake a test before large gatherings Take a test before large gatherings\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of different situations where people are testing these days,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cCertainly, if you're symptomatic and you think you've had a possible exposure, you should be testing.\u201d\n\nAlso, \u201cwe are seeing businesses and events testing folks with the rapid test, in addition to asking for proof of vaccination and booster, to keep group situations even more safe than they would otherwise be,\u201d she said. \u201cTesting can be used to mitigate the risk of being in a crowded, indoor gathering as long as everyone is willing to submit to testing and follow the results of the test\u2014not ignore them.\u201d\n\nThere is a COVID-19 breath test There is a COVID-19 breath test\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently granted emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 breath test that can detect COVID-19 in three minutes, but more still needs to be known.\n\nThis breath test \u201cis a new tool that we're just getting familiar with,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cI have not seen this test yet rolled out in hospitals, but I do understand it is present in some doctors' offices.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the cost of this test makes sense relative to the cost of performing just the rapid-antigen test in the traditional way,\u201d she added.\n\nIf vaccinated, you still need a test If vaccinated, you still need a test\n\nBeing vaccinated and boosted against SARS-CoV-2 lowers a person\u2019s risk of developing severe COVID-19, but there is still a risk for a breakthrough infection.\n\n\u201cHaving an exposure to COVID-19 and then developing symptoms\u2014even if you're vaccinated and boosted\u2014doesn't give you a pass from getting tested. You still should be tested,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cIf we know we're positive for COVID-19, even if we're vaccinated, we need to make sure and do our best to protect the vulnerable by staying away from them while we're positive with COVID-19 and while we recover.\n\n\u201cIt's important to be vaccinated, but it is not a panacea. It doesn't cure it all for COVID-19, but it does prevent people from dying from the disease,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated Coverage What it means for states to change how they report COVID-19 data\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variant testing is important SARS-CoV-2 variant testing is important\n\n\u201cFrom a practical perspective, the subvariants and variants have not really affected patient testing,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cThe laboratories are doing a really good job making sure that the variants, as they develop, are still detectable with our current testing methodologies.\n\n\u201cThere has not been too much of an issue with a change in sensitivity or specificity around the changing variants at this point,\u201d she added, noting \u201cthe variant testing is really important from a public health perspective\u2014this is largely done behind the scenes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get a test result from your hospital or physician\u2019s office\u2014where you have gotten a PCR test\u2014your test result is not going to tell you if you had a variant or not. That is information, again, that the public health teams are using to track the virus\u2019 evolution,\u201d Dr. Volk explained.\n\nTesting is part of the new normal Testing is part of the new normal\n\n\u201cTests are a really important tool in our toolbox to keep ourselves and our families and our communities safe from COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cIt's spring here in Louisville, Kentucky. We've got all kinds of lovely allergens floating around in the air that make my nose run constantly, and occasionally will make me feel tired.\n\n\u201cThese are symptoms that you can see if you have COVID-19,\u201d she added. \u201cSo, it's really helpful for me if I'm going to go into a situation where people are not vaccinated, to test myself, to make sure that I'm not missing a very low level or a very mild form of COVID-19 that I might be carrying, even though I'm fully vaccinated and boosted.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those who are not vaccinated\u2014or who may be vaccinated and immunosuppressed who have other risk factors for whom antivirals may be an appropriate intervention\u2014knowing for sure what's causing symptoms that mimic a cold or flu \u2026 can make a difference in the therapy that they seek, not to mention the directions they're going to want to follow about staying away from others,\u201d Dr. Volk said.\n\nIf test is positive, tell your doctor If test is positive, tell your doctor\n\n\u201cIt's a great idea if you come up positive for COVID-19 to let your doctor know,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cIt's a good idea not only from a personal health perspective, so your doctor knows what's going on with you \u2026 but it's also important from a public health perspective, so the public health authorities can keep track of how widespread the virus continues to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a patient takes an at-home test and it comes up positive, calling your doctor's office within that same day, or maybe early the next day, depending on how late it is, is a good idea,\u201d she said, noting that your physician can help determine your eligibility for effective antiviral treatments such as Paxlovid. \u201cIf you're having symptoms that are more severe that you can't manage by yourself at home, I would recommend heading to an urgent care center or an emergency room.\u201d\n\nPay attention to personal exposure Pay attention to personal exposure\n\n\u201cNegative test results are important pieces of information, just like positive test results are,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cJust like any other piece of medical information, you've got to take it into the whole context of what's been going on with that person.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if I have symptoms and I have been at a nightclub a couple of days before or the night before, and I'm suddenly not feeling great, and I get a negative at-home test, I'm probably going to want to go get a laboratory PCR test to follow that negative test up because my risk of exposure to COVID-19 is high,\u201d she added. \u201cNow, if I have been by myself, I haven\u2019t had any visitors for several weeks and I suddenly start feeling crummy \u2026 and I take the test and it comes up negative, I probably am going to feel a little better that I don\u2019t have COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone who\u2019s using that at-home test really needs to take into account the personal circumstances about their relative risk,\u201d Dr. Volk said.\n\nSome may need to test more frequently Some may need to test more frequently\n\n\u201cIf you're using the test in a prudent fashion, testing as much as daily may be appropriate for people who are in certain high-risk situations,\u201d Dr. Volk said.\n\n\u201cIf you are talking about potentially being around others who are unvaccinated because they can't be, or they chose not to be, and you have a high risk of carrying COVID because you're out in the world and so forth, testing daily may be a good option if you have access to those tests,\u201d she added.\n\nDon\u2019t test to get the result you want Don\u2019t test to get the result you want\n\n\u201cIt's important to not test to get the result you're looking for,\u201d Dr. Volk said. That means \u201cif you come up positive with a rapid at-home test and you really want to go to that wedding with your family in the coming weekend, testing yourself until you get a negative probably doesn't make sense.\n\n\u201cYou probably need to follow the information that you got from that first test and stay home from that wedding,\u201d she added. \u201cThe intention around the use of testing is actually fairly important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing is if you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, it really doesn't make sense to test every day until you clear the test,\u201d Dr. Volk said, noting that \u201cyou should wait about five days to retest before attempting to be around other people.\u201d\n\nFalse negatives can happen False negatives can happen\n\n\u201cWith any variant, someone could show up with a negative test for the first two days of symptoms, potentially, and then turn positive maybe on the third or fourth day,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cThat's always a possibility, depending on how many of the virus particles they are shedding in their upper respiratory tract\u2014their nose or their mouth if they\u2019re doing a saliva test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe advice has been to wait five to seven days of symptoms before testing in some cases. I'm not sure that's necessarily the thing to follow always,\u201d she said, noting \u201cwe're seeing folks who are coming up positive within a day or two of having symptoms.\u201d\n\nWith at-home testing, \u201cif you come up negative and you continue to have symptoms\u2014and you believe that you have been exposed\u2014and you test negative at day one or day two of your illness, testing again may make sense. That is, if you think you really may have the disease and just had a false negative test,\u201d Dr. Volk said. \u201cBut remember, a false negative test is far less common than a true negative test.\n\n\u201cAnd a false positive test is far less common than a true positive test,\u201d she added.\n\nGet vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted\n\n\u201cWith all of the information that we now have about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, my sincere hope is that those who have not done it yet will reconsider and get that vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cThe other thing is it's really important to get those boosters when it's time to get those boosters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hospitalizations from COVID have decreased recently\u201d because \u201cmore people have been vaccinated,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing as a pathologist and a chief medical officer is our hospitalized COVID-19 patients are almost always those who have never been vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic to watch folks become so ill that a machine needs to breathe for them,\u201d said Dr. Volk. \u201cIn some cases, they die from this illness, when it really was preventable.\u201d\n\nListen to more of this conversation with Dr. Volk on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or anywhere podcasts are available."

        "COVID-19 vaccines physicians' frequently asked questions",
        "Updated June 21, 2021\n\nVaccine authorization Vaccine authorization\n\nWhat processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness?\n\nAny vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues.\n\nThe American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process.\n\nWhat information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"?\n\nData and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA.\n\nData to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following:\n\nChemistry, manufacturing and controls information\n\nNonclinical data and information\n\nClinical data and information\n\nAdministrative and regulatory information\n\nHow does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take?\n\nThe FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA.\n\nAre mRNA vaccines safe?\n\nmRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.\n\nThere are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.\n\nMore information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC.\n\nVaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution\n\nHow will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)?\n\nInitial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers.\n\nTribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service.\n\nHow can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution?\n\nThe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped.\n\nWhen will vaccine be distributed to physician offices?\n\nIn April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step.\n\nVaccine administration Vaccine administration\n\nWhat do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nTo receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll.\n\nWhat vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine providers are required to:\n\nStore and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance.\n\nMonitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit.\n\nComply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions.\n\nMonitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates.\n\nPreserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years.\n\nComply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses.\n\nWhat will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits?\n\nAncillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine.\n\nNeedles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult)\n\nSyringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL)\n\nAlcohol prep pads, 210 per kit\n\nFour surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit\n\nVaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More\n\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs.\n\nNote that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use.\n\nIs there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration?\n\nCDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies.\n\nData reporting Data reporting\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting.\n\nVaccine safety Vaccine safety\n\nWhat additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization?\n\nAfter a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety.\n\nVAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not)\n\nSerious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event)\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nPhysicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events.\n\nIf a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter.\n\nClinical considerations Clinical considerations\n\nWhat are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)?\n\nThere is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of TTS?\n\nTTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae.\n\nWhat is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIf TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS.\n\nFor more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology.\n\nWhat allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19?\n\nContraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose.\n\nFor people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people?\n\nPregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.\n\nClinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway\n\nor planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19.\n\nWhat is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines?\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults.\n\nWhat is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients?\n\nImmunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people.\n\nBased on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPeople should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines?\n\nData are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection.\n\nBuilding vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence\n\nHow can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.\n\nExamples:"

        "Global Association of COVID-19 Pandemic Measures With Cancer Screening",
        "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a decrease in the number of cancer screening tests globally?\n\nFindings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 publications, the screening types analyzed were associated with a significant overall decrease (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) from January to October 2020. This decrease showed a U-shaped trend with a negative peak in April 2020 (\u221274.3% for mammography and \u221269.3% for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test) and in March 2020 for Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test (\u221278.8%).\n\nMeaning COVID-19 pandemic measures were associated with widely reduced cancer screening services, which was possibly associated with delayed cancer diagnosis and increased cancer mortality.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Public health services, including cancer screening tests, have been affected by the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nObjective To investigate the pandemic\u2019s association with cancer screening worldwide.\n\nData Sources In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021.\n\nStudy Selection Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included.\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period.\n\nResults The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) for breast cancer screening, \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was \u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified.\n\nConclusions and Relevance A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2020, according to GLOBOCAN estimates, 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million cancer deaths occurred owing to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, which are the first, third, and seventh most prevalent cancers worldwide, respectively.1 Screening programs help to detect cancer at early stages or precursor lesions, leading to decreased mortality.\n\nIn the past few years, especially in low- to medium-income countries,2 cancer screening and prevention protocols have had a remarkable impact on public health. However, major events, such as natural disasters and epidemics, can negatively affect screening rates and access to health care infrastructures and facilities,3 increasing the burden of cancer mortality.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a suspension of many nonurgent medical services was imposed all over the world. Affected services concerned, for example, family planning and abortion4; HIV prevention, testing, and care5; cancer prevention; specialistic treatments such as delays or deferrals in oncologic surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy; and visits for oncologic patients.6\n\nConsequently, cancer screening programs have been temporarily interrupted in most countries. Although these measures may have led to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission,7 their association with public health must still be determined.8\n\nBecause the lockdown restrictions have been heterogeneous in their beginning date and duration, we performed a systematic review of studies that analyzed the variation in the total number of examinations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening performed since the beginning of the epidemic in comparison with the prepandemic period. Our aim was to quantify the global variation of cancer screening procedures during the lockdown period.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Strategy and Selection Criteria\n\nWe conducted our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.9 We developed the study question by following the patients or the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) and study design framework.\n\nThis study is part of a larger project aimed at assessing the global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer, including not only cancer screening but also cancer diagnosis, diagnostic tests for cancer, therapies for oncologic patients, and first visits and follow-up visits for oncology patients. The search string was unique for all these outcomes. We launched the search string on PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus, without language restriction, for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. The search string was made using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and Medical Subject Headings terms and their builder options, if relevant, to improve the search results. Searches were performed with the following terms: neoplasms, diagnosis, drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control, early detection of cancer, COVID-19, and organization and administration.\n\nWe included observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries. We chose articles including a comparison between the periods before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with results indicated as number of screening tests performed, percentage variation between the 2 periods, or rate of screening. Studies were excluded if data on at least 1 of these comparisons were not available. We included only studies in which the 2 compared periods were explicitly stated. If the comparison was made between 2 or more pre\u2013COVID-19 periods, we selected the closest period as a reference (eg, we considered 2019 if data for both 2019 and 2018 were available).\n\nData Collection and Quality Assessment\n\nOur database search and study selection process are outlined in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We found a total of 3630 total articles: 998 articles on PubMed, 1471 on ProQuest, and 1161 on Scopus. We collected initial references in citation files, removed duplicates (1007 articles), and began our screening process of the remaining 2623 articles. We initially excluded articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish, or Italian, and also reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports (245 articles). After this process, studies were first reviewed by title and then by abstract. Finally, we examined the full text of each article against eligibility criteria, and we collected 140 studies for all the outcomes of the research project (screening, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, visits, and therapies). Results on cancer screening were reported in 39 articles. We decided to analyze the types of cancer screening recommended for the general population by the US Preventive Services Task Force.10-12 We excluded screening types performed for high-risk individuals (eg, lung cancer screening13) and those with lower-grade recommendation (eg, prostate cancer screening14). The title and abstract of the articles were independently reviewed by 2 pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) for inclusion in the first screening phase, followed by the full-text screening phase against eligibility criteria. Disagreements among reviewers in the initial abstract screening phase and full-text review were resolved through discussion with a fifth reviewer (P.B.).\n\nTwo pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) perused the prepared checklist to extract from each article the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, country and type of setting (hospitals and private centers were considered clinic based; local and national cancer registries were considered population based), site of cancer, type of screening analyzed (mammography, research of blood in the stool with the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, or human papillomavirus test), and absolute number or rate of screening tests performed in the analyzed period or percentage variation between intervals before and after the beginning of the pandemic. In particular, for colorectal cancer screening, we analyzed data from both types of screening (fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy) separately and together.\n\nWe performed an assessment of the quality and risk of bias of all the studies included, using 9 of the 10 items of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research,15 for a maximum score of 10 points. Studies obtaining less than 7 points were considered inadequate and excluded (no article was excluded because of a low-quality score). eTables 1 through 3 in the Supplement list the articles included in the present analysis and their major characteristics and quality assessment.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nFor each type of screening, we calculated the weighted average of the percentage variation between screening tests performed before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight was calculated with the natural logarithm of the number of daily events in the prepandemic period (ie, daily_screen_precovid obtained by dividing the number of screening tests in the prepandemic period by its duration in days: weight = ln [daily_screen_precovid]). We used the logarithm because of the great variability in the number of tests between studies. We used the absolute value to avoid negative weights.\n\nSome studies did not provide the absolute number of screening tests performed in the prepandemic period, but only the measure of variation between the period being examined and the reference period. For these studies, to calculate the weight, we imputed a value of daily_screen_precovid as the mean value of this variable in the studies having the same type of setting and cancer screening.\n\nWe divided the pandemic period into 5 intervals (all referring to 2020) based on the beginning date of the COVID-19 period being examined in each article as follows: period 1 from January 1 to February 29; period 2 from March 1 to March 31; period 3 from April 1 to April 30; period 4 from May 1 to May 31; and period 5 from June 1 to October 31. This partition of the 5 periods was based on temporal distribution of the available observations along the pandemic period and on the trend of COVID-19 spread and pandemic measures in most countries.16 We did not include studies in which the pandemic period started before January 2020. We did not find studies in which the pandemic period of observation started after October 2020. Studies could contribute to more than 1 period, but not more than once in each period. Then we calculated weighted averages for each interval. Because each period analyzed was determined only by the starting date of the observation, for some studies it could include an interval longer than the predefined periods (eg, an observation that considered January 1 as the starting date and May 31 as the end date was included in the first period).\n\nAn additional analysis was performed for specific geographic areas and for type of setting. We finally fitted ordinary least-squares linear model using Newton-Raphson (maximum likelihood) optimization with percentage change as dependent variables and terms for type of structure, geographic area, and period as independent variables. In the linear regression model, 2-sided P values were used, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.\n\nBecause a percentage reduction could not be lower than \u2212100%, we limited the values of the 95% CIs to \u2212100.0% in case they exceeded it. We considered the funnel plot and performed the Egger regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias.17\n\nNo ethics committee approval and no patient consent were necessary because the study was restricted to publicly available data. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). P values of differences of means are based on the t test, those of differences of proportions are based on z scores, and P tests of multivariate analyses are those derived from the regression generalized linear models for the respective variables.\n\nResults\n\nData on race and ethnicity, as well as demographic information for the study population, were not available. eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the weighted average variation of screening tests performed by cancer type, and Figure 2 shows the corresponding temporal trend.\n\nBreast Cancer\n\nThe average variation of breast cancer screening from January to October 2020 was \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period. The maximum decrease in breast cancer screening occurred in April 2020 (\u221274.3% [95% CI, \u221291.8% to \u221256.7%]), whereas after June there was no significant reduction (\u221213.0% [95% CI, \u221233.0% to 7.1%]). The weighted average of the screening variation was \u221262.0% (95% CI, \u221275.1% to \u221249.0%) for clinic-based settings and \u221241.6% (95% CI, \u221253.2% to \u221230.0%) for population-based ones. The difference between the 2 types of structures was confirmed to be statistically significant in the linear regression analysis (adjusted difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 35.9%; P = .03) (Table 1).\n\nWe divided the geographic areas for breast cancer screening according to the distribution of the countries analyzed in each study: North America (United States and Canada), South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and Europe (Italy, France, and Turkey). In North America, the number of breast cancer screening tests decreased by \u221244.6% (95% CI, \u221257.4% to \u221231.8%) during the COVID-19 period. In this geographic area, the decrease was \u221219.4% (95% CI, \u221255.1% to 16.2%) in January and February, \u221249.9% (95% CI, \u221266.5% to \u221233.2%) in March, \u221286.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221273.5%) in April, \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221262.3% to \u221213.4%) in May, and 0.8% (95% CI, \u221214.1% to 15.7%) from June to October 2020. Europe presented an average variation of \u221267.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u22129.3%), and South America presented an average variation of \u221251.1% (95% CI, \u221267.5% to \u221234.7%). As shown in Table 1, the decrease during April was significant (\u221253.8%; 95% CI, \u221275.4% to \u221232.2%; P < .001), using January and February as the reference; studies from Europe also reported a larger decrease compared with those from North America (\u221235.6%; 95% CI, \u221265.9% to \u22125.3%; P = .02).\n\nColorectal Cancer\n\nThe overall decrease in the number of colorectal cancer screening examinations performed throughout the period from January to October 2020 compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period was equal to \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%). In particular, the decrease for colonoscopy was \u221252.5% (95% CI, \u221266.3% to \u221238.8%), and the decrease for fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test was \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221249.9% to \u221225.8%). The weighted average variation was \u221251.5% (95% CI, \u221269.5% to \u221233.6%) in clinic-based settings and \u221243.7% (95% CI, \u221254.9% to \u221232.6%) in population-based ones.\n\nCompared with the prepandemic period, the global evolution by period showed the greatest decrease in April 2020 (\u221269.3% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221236.9%]) and only a partial recovery during the last months of the analysis (\u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]) from June to October (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nWe analyzed the 3 main geographic areas, including North America (United States and Canada), Asia (India, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and Europe (Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). The weighted average variation during the entire COVID-19 period was \u221245.1% (95% CI, \u221259.3% to \u221231.0%) for North America, \u221234.6% (95% CI, \u221258.1% to \u221211.1%) for Asia, and \u221252.4% (95% CI, \u221269.4% to \u221235.3%) for Europe. For North America, the greatest decrease was in April (\u221283.0% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221255.8%]), whereas in Asia the most remarkable decrease in screening rates was observed in January and February (\u221236.2% [95% CI, \u221277.9% to \u22125.6%]). In linear regression analysis, April had a greater decrease compared with January and February (\u221238.3%; 95% CI, \u221263.6% to \u221212.9%; P = .003), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between geographic areas (Table 2).\n\nCervical Cancer\n\nFor cervical cancer screening, the weighted average variation was equal to \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%). The maximum decrease observed among the 5 periods was in March (\u221278.8% [95% CI, \u221299.3% to \u221258.3%]). In the linear regression model (Table 3), a significant decrease was observed in March compared with January and February (\u221238.9%; 95% CI, \u221275.2% to \u22122.5%; P = .04). Clinic-based studies showed a greater reduction than the population-based ones: \u221251.7% (95% CI, \u221277.3% to \u221226.1%) and \u221251.9% (95% CI, \u221267.8% to \u221235.9%), respectively. In North America (United States and Canada), the weighted average variation was \u221244.7% (95% CI, \u221273.8% to \u221215.7%), whereas in South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico), it was \u221262.4% (95% CI, \u221273.3% to \u221251.5%).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study investigated the association of the COVID-19 pandemic measures with cancer screening by systematic review. Against a global pattern showing an increasing trend for colorectal cancer screening and a slight decrease for cervical cancer screening and mammography from 2000 to 2015,18 our study found a marked association with a decrease in the number of tests performed for the 3 cancer types (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) in all geographic areas considered during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the decision to interrupt all cancer screening programs, the main factors that may have caused this reduction were stay-at-home orders, people's fear of the infection, avoidance of nonurgent medical treatment and care, limited access to in-person medical examinations, and the reorganization of hospital departments.6 The greater decrease for the Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test and colonoscopies may be attributable to more invasive techniques used to diagnose these tumors compared with mammography for breast cancer and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer.\n\nWe identified a similar pattern by period for breast and colorectal cancer screening, with a U-shaped trend having a negative peak in April 2020 and an attenuation in May. This trend was largely attributable to the lockdown measures in numerous countries and territories worldwide. As illustrated through the stringency index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,16 in April 2020 most of the countries had implemented COVID-19 measures. All 3 types of cancer screening showed the least reduction from June to October.\n\nA significant feature of the present study is the analysis of different geographic areas; Europe presented a larger decrease in mammograms compared with North America (Table 1), which could be associated with the fact that in the United States, they are mostly performed through private health insurance,18 whereas in Europe, they are usually provided as part of the public health care system. Conversely, the decrease was similar for colorectal cancer screening between the 2 regions. The restrictions that occurred in Europe could therefore have had a greater association with the cancer screening procedures that imply an actual attendance to the health care structure providing the service. Our results indicated that invasive colorectal cancer screenings (colonoscopies) had a larger decrease than noninvasive ones, such as fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test (\u221252.5% vs 37.8%, respectively), which were more easily performed as a colonoscopy alternative.19 Unlike the global decrease in colorectal cancer screening, Asia presented the most remarkable decrease in January and February; however, the variability of COVID-19 epidemiology and restrictive measures between Asian countries20,21 complicates the interpretation of this matter.\n\nThe percentage variation for cervical and breast cancer screening was greater in South America compared with North America (\u221262.4% vs \u221244.7% and \u221251.1% vs \u221244.6%, respectively); however, we cannot assume that it will result in worse consequences for Latin America owing to its weaker health care system before the pandemic.22\n\nAn important aspect of our review was the consistency of results across a wide spectrum of health care settings. The association between the epidemic and cancer screening was greater in studies based in hospitals or other clinic settings than in population-based studies, especially for breast cancer screening (\u221262.0% vs \u221241.6%; P = .03), which could be explained by clinic-based studies\u2019 considering only the decrease in the number of patients who actually attended the screening test vs population-based studies\u2019 including also patients who did not participate in screening programs in the prepandemic period. There was no evidence of publication bias either qualitatively according to funnel plot asymmetry or quantitatively with the Egger regression test.\n\nThe aim of identifying early neoplastic lesions in the case of breast cancer and precursor lesions in the case of colorectal and cervical cancer was to decrease the incidence of invasive cancer.23 The most concerning potential effect of a decrease in cancer screening is an increase in cancer mortality, as estimated in the United States.24 The interruption of cancer screening could delay diagnosis of tumors, causing a shift to more advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, this could be associated with increased avoidable cancer deaths, aggravate the patients\u2019 discomfort and disease burden, and be associated with increased workload for medical personnel and increased costs for the health care system.8,25,26 In addition, a portion of the postponed screening tests could be impossible to recover because during the suspension some patients exceeded the maximum age to be included in screening programs.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur review has some limitations. First, considerable heterogeneity between countries was present in terms of screening protocols,27 services\u2019 accessibility and participation of the target population, lockdown measures, and incidence of COVID-19 and its temporal trend; all of these factors could not be considered in our statistical analysis. Second, the attribution of an observation to 1 of the 5 periods was based only on its beginning date, which might lead to nondifferential misclassification. Future studies on variations in screening numbers will need to be performed to clarify long-term implications and adopt adequate public health strategies. Third, in some studies we had to impute the number of daily events to calculate the weight.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, with a U-shaped temporal pattern. Although for breast and cervical cancer screening, the data suggest a recovery after May 2020, the decrease in colorectal cancer screening persisted until October 2020. This is expected to be associated with an increase of avoidable advanced cancers and cancer-related deaths. Further investigation regarding cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is required.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 18, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.2617\n\nCorresponding Author: Paolo Boffetta, MD, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy (paolo.boffetta@unibo.it).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Teglia and Angelini had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nConcept and design: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nDrafting of the manuscript: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nStatistical analysis: Teglia, Angelini.\n\nSupervision: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported."

        "Hospitalization Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19 Undergoing Remote Monitoring",
        "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is participation in a remote monitoring program for COVID-19, supported by nurses around the clock, associated with subsequent hospitalization?\n\nFindings In this cohort study of 9378 patients, participation in a remote monitoring program was associated with lower odds of hospitalization 2 to 14 days after a positive COVID-19 test, after an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting.\n\nMeaning These findings suggest that remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 may help patients better manage symptoms at home and help hospitals better manage bed capacity.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Health care systems have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs to manage patients with COVID-19 at home, but the associations between participation and outcomes or resource utilization are unclear.\n\nObjective To assess whether an RPM program for COVID-19 is associated with lower or higher likelihood of hospitalization and whether patients who are admitted present earlier or later for hospital care.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational, cohort study of RPM was performed at Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, an academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Participants included patients with internal primary care physicians and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ambulatory setting between March 30, 2020, and December 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022.\n\nExposures Activation of RPM program.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations within 2 to 14 days of a positive test. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for differences between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed looking at usage of the RPM among patients who activated the program.\n\nResults A total of 10 660 COVID-19\u2013positive ambulatory patients were eligible, and 9378 (88.0%) had email or mobile numbers on file and were invited into the RPM program; the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (16.3) years and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Patients who activated monitoring (5364 patients [57.2%]) had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) free-text comments. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert; 128 of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001). In weighted regression analysis, activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and time period. Monitored patients had a longer mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days), a shorter length of stay (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days), and less intensive care use (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]).\n\nConclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that activation of an RPM program is associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care use, and length of stay among patients with COVID-19.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required substantial and expeditious changes to health care systems to address challenges posed toward allocating hospital resources, preventing community transmission, and treating patients.1-4 Particularly during the pandemic onset and the waves of more contagious variants, substantial strain has been placed on hospital systems to address shortages of staff, beds, and supplies,5 forcing them to implement rationing programs and measures to match patients with the most appropriate level of care.6 To mitigate community transmission and optimize resource utilization, health care systems have rapidly expanded telemedicine programs across all specialties.7,8 In addition, strategies to care for people at home using remote patient monitoring (RPM) were created to triage and manage patients with COVID-19, who may worsen during the duration of their illness.9 For example, patients who present with mild symptoms at initial diagnosis can deteriorate greatly during the course of their illness, requiring hospital admission and critical care.10 Although RPM has generally been trialed in the management of chronic disease, it may also be an effective tool to manage health care resources for more acute episodes of care.8,11-14\n\nPrevious studies8,15,16 evaluated home monitoring in patients with COVID-19 with mild symptoms during self-isolation, with early studies17 showing positive results with fewer admissions. Pulse oximetry at home has been successful in identifying patients needing emergent medical attention.14,18-20 It is unclear, however, whether participating in an RPM program is associated with patient outcomes or appropriate in-person resource utilization.\n\nOur objective in this study is to evaluate the implementation of a large-scale daily RPM program for patients with COVID-19 who were managing symptoms from home. We particularly sought to assess the association of RPM with health care utilization (ie, whether RPM would be associated with increased or decreased admissions compared with those not undergoing monitoring). Secondarily, we sought to see whether patients who were eventually admitted would present earlier or later for hospital care. In these analyses, we sought to also know whether RPM was associated with inappropriate admissions (length of stay \u22641 day) or inappropriate home care (a delayed presentation leading to higher mortality, intensive care utilization, or length of stay).\n\nMethods\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\n\nThis cohort study was conducted within an academic-community health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network provides 1.5 million ambulatory visits and cares for 55 000 hospitalized patients annually. The Health Network operates 45 clinic locations in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.\n\nAll patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at an affiliated laboratory site who tested positive were eligible for the program. Any patient could request testing either through our mobile application, patient portal, telephone, or in-person urgent care or scheduled ambulatory visits. Patients were automatically invited to enroll in the RPM program if their email address or mobile telephone number was on file at the time of testing. Patients were also invited if they had an affiliated primary care physician (PCP) within the system and had an outside positive test that was abstracted into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver and agreed to the program\u2019s terms of use at enrollment. In addition to the email invitation, patients received a COVID Care Kit, a collection of educational materials, handouts, and a pulse oximeter that was available to pick up from testing sites; after October 2020, kits were automatically shipped to patients.\n\nThe program group was defined as any patient who activated the RPM program. Activation was defined as claiming an account within the RPM platform. As a sensitivity analysis, we secondarily assessed participation if the patient, in addition to activating their account, had at least 1 or more check-ins, which are programmed questions to which patients respond.\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.21\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nAll patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of March 31, 2020, through December 15, 2020, at an affiliated laboratory site. Follow-up data collection for hospitalization within 14 days continued through December 31, 2020. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with asymptomatic tests (because these were often scheduled before procedures or other planned admissions), abstracted results, and patients who were admitted within 24 hours of a positive test. We further limited the patient sample to those who had internal PCPs to reduce the chance of missing hospitalizations.\n\nCOVID-19 RPM Program\n\nThe COVID-19 RPM program was an automated engagement solution, supported by registered nurses, designed to improve the patient experience, coordinate care, and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On March 30, 2020, the system began the program using GetWellLoop (GetWellNetwork) monitored by a centralized team of Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin nurses. Patients either used a responsive web application or downloaded a mobile application. Patients were asked to track their symptoms, temperatures, and pulse oximetry readings, if available. The program provided 14 days of check-ins related to progress and symptoms, in the form of questions and structured responses, while also providing a space for free-text comments (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The program also provided educational guidance related to COVID-19, including caring for themselves at home, minimizing spread, and stress management.\n\nA centralized virtual care team (VCT) monitored patient check-ins and free-text comments around the clock. Abnormal survey responses (eg, breathing issues or worsening fever) alerted VCT members on their dashboard. Upon reviewing the alert, the VCT contacted patients to initiate an escalation of care or to conduct further medical evaluation if warranted. VCT nurses also reacted to patient comments independently from alerts to provide education or coaching, such as how to incorporate lying in the prone position (ie, proning) into their daily care. Patients were discharged from monitoring after 18 days.\n\nData Collection\n\nData for evaluating program outcomes were collected using reporting databases from the EHR (Epic Systems). We collected patient profile data, including sex, age, race, address, marital status, insurance, and PCP status (internal or external). Race was assessed in this study because of known racial and ethnic disparities in accessing digital health care services.22-24 We used patient addresses geocoded to the Census block level to determine the local area deprivation index, derived from the US Census and American Community Survey,25 as a measure of socioeconomic status and grouped by quartile.26-28\n\nData about the clinical scenario (including presence of symptoms and their onset) were derived from the individual testing orders. We obtained other clinical data, including body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and comorbidities as calculated through the Charlson Comorbidity Index29,30 from the EHR as of the testing date. Participation in the RPM program was provided through platform usage data. These data included system registration, activation, check-ins, alerts, and comments.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\nOur primary outcome was hospitalization within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Hospitalizations were included if they had a flag as being related to COVID-19 through laboratory testing or hospital billing diagnosis. Hospitalizations outside the health system were not available, and readmissions were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the likelihood of missing outside hospitalizations, we limited the analysis to patients with an internal PCP because patients with external PCPs may be more likely to seek hospital care elsewhere.\n\nTo know whether RPM inadvertently may have been associated with increased mortality, such as by delaying hospitalization, we secondarily tracked patient deaths of the study cohort. Thirty-day mortality and 90-day mortality were defined as a patient marked as deceased within the EHR and/or having a death date noted within 30 or 90 days, respectively, of a positive test date. Mortality data were extracted from the EHR system in November 2021 in case death reporting in the EHR lagged.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. To examine factors associated with activation, patients were divided into those who were enrolled and activated and those who were enrolled and did not activate. Age was categorized for analysis. We calculated the frequency for variables related to patient demographics and information related to personal health and COVID-19 status, along with means and SDs for time intervals, such as length of stay and time from test to hospitalization. A t test was used to test the mean difference of the 2 groups (RPM activated or not) in terms of the characteristics measured in continuous variables, whereas a \u03c72 test was adopted for categorical variables. For time intervals (time to hospitalization and length of stay), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Two-sided tests were used with a priori levels of significance of \u03b1 = .05. All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31\n\nTo assess the association between activation and hospitalization, we performed propensity-weighted logistic regression using the glm package.32 With all patients being invited to use the RPM program, we used inverse propensity score weighting to account for potential bias in the observed covariates through self-selection or other mechanisms following methods by Olmos et al.33 Covariates included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, time period, insurance, marital status, Area Deprivation Index from the Census block level, encounter type where testing was ordered, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, prior hospitalization, and digital engagement proxied as having reviewed their COVID-19 test results electronically through the patient portal or the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin mobile application. We also included a variable for time period (1 of the 3 waves in 2020) to allow for varying mean differences in outcomes over time due to patient behavior, including care avoidance34 at the beginning of the pandemic, and guideline changes during the 3 COVID-19 waves that could have affected enrollment status or clinical outcomes. The average treatment effect was calculated as the mean difference in weighted outcomes between the activated group and the invited but nonactivated group. Inverse probability weights were based on the propensity score of each patient,35 defined as the probability of a patient activating RPM conditional on observed covariates as described already, for doubly robust estimation.36\n\nWith less than 4% of the data missing observations for either socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or obesity, the primary analysis was run on complete cases. We used multiple imputation using the mice37,38 package to confirm the results. We ran additional models that included only activated RPM patients and factoring whether they engaged in the program (had check-ins digitally) or not. We also performed propensity score matching with full matching39 using the MatchIT40 package. Finally, we performed a propensity-weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis on complete-case data using the Survival41 and Survminer42 packages. In the weighted Cox model, the starting point was the date of the test and patients were only censored at day 14.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the study period, 135 786 patients underwent testing for COVID-19, and 25 040 patients (18.4%) had at least 1 positive test. Of these patients, 10 660 were retained for analysis after excluding those who were younger than 18 years, who did not have an internal PCP, or who were hospitalized at the time of testing (Figure 1). A total of 9378 patients (88.0%) were offered enrollment into the RPM program through an email invitation, comprising the final analytical cohort. The mean (SD) age of invited patients was 46.9 (16.3) years, and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women.\n\nEngagement With the RPM Program\n\nOf the 9378 invited patients, 5364 (57.2%) activated monitoring (Table 1). Patients who activated were predominantly female (3467 of 5364 patients [64.6%] vs 1981 of 4014 patients [49.4%]). Differences in activation by race and ethnicity were not significant, although differences by comorbidities were observed. Patients with Medicare were also less likely to activate than those without Medicare (795 of 5364 patients [14.8%] vs 769 of 4014 patients [19.2%]; \u03c72 3 = 38.65; P < .001). When patients requested testing through our digital platform for testing, 1805 of 2927 patients (61.7%) activated, whereas 354 of 723 patients (49.0%) with in-person visits activated (\u03c72 5 = 61.25; P < .001).\n\nPatients who activated had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) comments with their clinical care teams. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert.\n\nUtilization and Clinical Outcomes\n\nOne hundred twenty-eight of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized within 2 to 14 days of their test (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001) (Table 2). The odds of admission were higher for patients with advanced age, male gender, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with obesity or more medical comorbidities. The mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization was slightly longer among activated patients (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days). Among those patients admitted, the mean (SD) length of stay was 2.7 days lower for RPM-activated patients than for nonactivated patients (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days; t = \u22123.4185; df = 244.03; P = .001). Monitored patients had less intensive care use than those who were not monitored (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Patients with RPM were not significantly more likely to have short (length of stay \u22641 day) hospital stays (47 of 222 patients [21.2%] vs 50 of 210 patients [23.8%]). The unadjusted 90-day mortality for all patients was 0.2% (10 patients) among activated patients and 0.6% (26 patients) among nonactivated patients.\n\nLogistic Regression With Inverse Propensity Score Weighting\n\nIn multivariable regression analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (for the likelihood of activating RPM, the C statistic was 0.67; for balance and propensity distribution, see eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement), activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) (Table 3). Results using multiple imputation for missing data were similar (eTable 1 in the Supplement). As a robustness check, the Cox proportional-hazard regression with inverse propensity score weighting provided similar results (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), as did regression with propensity score matching (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). As a sensitivity analysis of only activated patients, patients with check-ins had a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73; P = .001) after weighting on propensity to have at least 1 check-in (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 9378 patients who were offered RPM for COVID-19, activation of the RPM program was associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and length of stay. Following an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting, patients who activated still had lower odds of being hospitalized, adjusted for observed clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nAlthough a strict control group was not available, because of the rapid implementation and goal of assisting patients and clinical operations, several methods including the inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching were used to balance the comparison cohorts on the basis of the observed covariates. The positive outcomes seen in reducing hospitalization are similar to those described in earlier studies.11,17,43-45 We found baseline differences between patients who did and did not active RPM, similar to prior studies, although our application of the inverse propensity score weighting provides a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of these observed differences on our result and a more advanced analytical evaluation of the association of RPM with the main study outcomes. Our study is also different because it was delivered to a more general population as well.\n\nThe mechanism underlying RPM\u2019s association with hospitalization is not clear, but several factors may explain it. First, patients who were monitored also received education that may have affected their care trajectory, such as proning to help improve oxygenation. Second, physicians caring for patients who received the pulse oximetry and nurse support through the RPM might have felt comfortable not sending patients into the emergency department and hospital. An alternate explanation is that patients who activated were less ill, and residual confounding that could not be removed accounted for these differences. In both inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching, with reasonable C statistics and matching parameters, the associations persisted.\n\nIn addition to findings related to hospital admission, the data showed that patients who were admitted to the hospital while being monitored were hospitalized later than those without monitoring. Although the reasons behind such delays are not immediately known, there are different hypotheses that may explain this finding. One could be that the RPM program allowed patients to be managed and monitored at a level that would have required an admission for those who were not enrolled in the RPM\u2014that is, either the patient or a clinician chose to defer hospital-based care because of the availability of RPM. Another factor could be that the nurses\u2019 support through the RPM program delivered remote care that decreased risk and led to only essential admissions. This finding does not support a preintervention hypothesis that RPM would signal patients to be admitted earlier. The findings suggest that, although patients under RPM were admitted, on average, later than non-RPM patients, the late presentation was not inappropriate given that hospital length of stay, critical care utilization, and mortality were not increased in this group.\n\nOur study also found that age and race were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization. These results mirror the current body of evidence suggesting who is most at risk both for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe symptoms.46-48 To that end, although RPM and other digital interventions can be effective in deploying and allocating scarce health care resources, we must continue investigating whether such strategies exacerbate existing disparities in care utilization and outcomes. These disparities have been observed in many other digital health interventions, including video visits and telemedicine.49-51\n\nThe lessons learned from our study and others are numerous, although many questions remain regarding best practice RPM implementation for COVID-19 and other diseases and conditions. First, it remains unknown at which point in the course of disease RPM is most impactful on outcomes. Although the digital component of the RPM is easily scalable, concerns regarding other components should be carefully evaluated. In our study, we implemented a remote nurse support model. The virtual nurses had full access to the EHR and could communicate with clinical care teams. Expanding similar programs across multiple areas and diseases would require sophisticated operations and resource allocations. Further research and evaluation of these new remote operating models are warranted and should be carefully evaluated for safety.\n\nExpansion of these programs should consider access and equity. In a previous study,50 we have demonstrated that access to digital technology is disproportionate among racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our program was accessible to anyone with a smartphone, although some technological literacy is required. Simple text messaging may also help reach additional people.\n\nLimitations\n\nSome limitations of this study should be addressed. With the observational nature of the study, selection bias of healthier patients into the RPM activation exists, and although we used propensity score adjustment, residual confounding may still persist. The data were retrospective and sourced from databases, which may make the results less reliable. For example, we could not verify whether hospitalization, escalation of care, or mortality were a result of COVID-19 or another cause. To mitigate this effect, we attempted to limit follow-up data to include 15 days given the reported duration of symptoms, and we reexamined mortality data from the EHR after at least 9 months following the study period. Location and hospital system factors may have influenced enrollment rates and clinical outcomes, which could make our results less generalizable to all populations.\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 treatment guidelines (decision to place patients in the prone position or intubation recommendations), diagnosis (evolving symptom profile), and community transmission were highly dynamic during the early course of the pandemic.52,53 Clinical outcomes may have improved throughout the course of the pandemic. The RPM program was also rapidly updated throughout the pandemic, although the core content of monitoring, proning as tolerated, and infection control for ambulatory patients remained the same. These data were from the prevaccine era; after vaccines became available54 and distributed,55 the absolute benefit of RPM may have decreased for low-risk individuals.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis report builds upon experiences from other groups showing that RPM for COVID-19 was feasible and well-received, while adding data about outcomes. Moving beyond COVID-19, these data highlight where RPM can be a helpful adjunct to care. Resource optimization is a central tenet of both RPM and pandemic-era practices. If reducing avoidable admissions can be achieved through virtual interventions, then practitioners can focus on in-person care for the most ill patients while also limiting unnecessary contact at hospitals and clinics, which is key to decreasing the spread of COVID-19. These results may also be used to establish better care guidelines for those monitoring moderate symptoms from home. Future studies should include ethnically diverse and low health care access populations, which are shown to be at higher risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 2, 2022.\n\nPublished: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.21050\n\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Crotty BH et al.

        "Leading Causes of Death in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic, March 2020 to October 2021",
        "In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death in the US, accounting for 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, accounting for 350 000 deaths.1-3 The pandemic may also have indirectly led to increases in other causes of death, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and unintentional injuries.2,4 We examined the leading causes of death in the US, overall and in various age groups, from March 2020 to October 2021.\n\nMethods\n\nWe obtained final national death certificate data for 2020 and provisional data for 2021 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (accessed May 5, 20225). We excluded data more recent than October 2021 because they were incomplete. We determined the 5 leading causes of death by year and age group, and compared the period March to December 2020 with the period January to October 2021. Because the data are publicly available, the study did not require institutional review board review.\n\nResults\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%) were the most common causes of death in the US. There were 2.875 million deaths in March to December 2020 and 2.855 million deaths in January to October 2021; the 5 leading causes of death were the same in each year. Among those older than 1 year, the number of deaths increased across age groups.\n\nDeaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 accounted for the largest number of deaths in every group aged 55 years and older (Table, Figure). The leading 3 causes of death in these age groups were the same in 2020 and 2021. Among people aged 85 years and older, COVID-19 was ranked as the second leading cause of death in 2020 (110 000 deaths, 12.8% of deaths), and third in 2021 (69 000, 8.9% of deaths). Among those aged 45 to 54 years, COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2020 (17 000 deaths, 10.4% of deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and accidents; in 2021, however, it was the leading cause of death (30 000 deaths, 16.8% of deaths).\n\nIn both time periods, accidents accounted for the largest number of deaths in every age group 1 to 44 years. Compared with 2020, COVID-19 increased from the fifth (6100 deaths) to the second leading cause of death (13 000 deaths) among those aged 35 to 44 years in 2021, became the fourth leading cause of death in 2021 among those aged 25 to 34 years (5000 deaths), and those aged 15 to 24 years (1100 deaths).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 deaths in the US and was a top 5 cause of death in every age group aged 15 years and older. Cancer and heart disease deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths overall and in most age groups, whereas accidents were the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years. Compared with the 2020 time period, deaths from COVID-19 in the 2021 time period decreased in ranking among those aged 85 years or older but increased in ranking among those aged 15 to 54 years, and became the leading cause of death among those aged 45 to 54 years.\n\nThe increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020,6 perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups.\n\nThe pandemic also has had indirect effects on other causes of death in the US. From 2019 to 2020, death rates increased for heart disease, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes.2 Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes.4 Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups; the pandemic may have contributed to some of these deaths.\n\nOur analysis was limited by potential misclassification of the cause of death and incomplete death data for 2021, although we included a lag of 6 months to increase the completeness of the provisional data. Moreover, because our analysis only extended through October 2021, it does not include deaths that occurred during the Omicron wave of the pandemic of late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 9, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 5, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2476\n\nCorresponding Author: Meredith S.

        "What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 oral antivirals",
        "Since its emergence, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. This rise in COVID-19 cases has strained hospitals and emergency departments across the United States, increasing the demand for treatments. While there is an ongoing need for people to get vaccinated\u2014and boosted\u2014against COVID-19, two antiviral oral treatments are available in limited supplies, but patient confusion still remains about who is eligible and how these treatments work.\n\nWhat you need to know about COVID-19 Explore top articles, videos, research highlights and more from the AMA\u2014your source for clear, evidence-based news and guidance during the pandemic. See the Latest Updates\n\nLast month, the two oral antivirals\u2014Paxlovid (PDF) and molnupiravir (PDF)\u2014were authorized for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 under emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Learn what COVID-19 treatments are FDA authorized, and what works.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious disease specialist, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills.\n\nThere are two options There are two options\n\n\u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she added, noting that when this antiviral enters the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently authorized for use in all adult patients and in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d\n\nThey prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death\n\nWhile data is still limited, \u201cin one study that was cited in the EUA, Paxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d\n\nThe pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure\n\n\u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, the EUA for these two medications really only covers those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said.\n\nRelated Coverage What physicians need to know about COVID-19 clinical therapeutics\n\nSevere COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care\n\n\u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nPaxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets\n\nAs a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tables of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nMolnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules\n\n\u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said.\n\nSome side effects are expected Some side effects are expected\n\n\u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness.\u201d\n\nShare what medications you\u2019re taking Share what medications you\u2019re taking\n\n\u201cPaxlovid, because it has that boosting medication ritonavir as one of its components, creates potential drug interactions,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor anybody who receives a prescription for Paxlovid, they should make sure that their physician reviews all of the patient\u2019s other medications that they are taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat includes over-the-counter medications and supplements or other non-prescription medications that they take, to check for any drug interactions,\u201d she added, noting \u201cit\u2019s easiest to do that through certain drug interaction tools for which physicians will have access.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany patients don\u2019t think to mention medications that they\u2019re taking that are non-prescription or that may be supplements, but everything should be mentioned to their physicians,\u201d said Dr. Choi.\n\nSupplies are limited Supplies are limited\n\n\u201cThe demand is just outstripping the supply for these oral antivirals right now due to the quickly spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi, noting that \u201cmost of the access for these medications are being directed by the state health departments to specific local health departments, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and physician offices.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all physicians will be able to get these medications on demand for their patients\u2014there\u2019s a lot of state-to-state variability,\u201d she said.\n\nConsult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant\n\n\u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area and treatments for COVID-19 infection are limited,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d\n\nNot everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills\n\n\u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d\n\nGet vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted\n\n\u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We have so much more vaccine available than antivirals, currently, and prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d which means two doses of a mRNA vaccine and a booster shot..\n\n\u201cIf they have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine but have not received their COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to get their booster dose\u201d when eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines and boosters work against the Omicron variant, and they will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated and boosted as completely as possible against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVisit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics."

        "Monkeypox declared a global emergency: will it help contain the outbreak?",
        "The World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, rang the agency\u2019s highest alarm on 23 July to signal the seriousness of the global monkeypox outbreaks.Credit: Lindsay Mackenzie/WHO\n\nOver the weekend, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the monkeypox outbreak spreading globally is a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019 (PHEIC). Researchers hope that the declaration \u2014 the agency\u2019s highest alarm \u2014 might serve as a wake-up call for countries as they struggle to contain the spread of the virus that causes monkeypox.\n\nSince the first cases were detected outside Africa in May, more than 16,500 people have been confirmed infected in nearly 80 countries that don\u2019t typically see cases. Monkeypox has been circulating in parts of Africa for decades.\n\nThis is the seventh time since the alarm system originated in 2005 that the WHO has declared a PHEIC \u2014 a step it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries, and that require a coordinated international response (see \u2018The highest alarm\u2019). Two of those warnings, for COVID-19 and polio, are still in place.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the PHEIC on 23 July, after a panel of advisers failed to come to a consensus. Although the panel doesn\u2019t formally vote, six members were in favour of declaring a PHEIC, while nine were against, Tedros said at a press conference announcing his decision. The panel had previously met in late June, but at that time only three members were for declaring a PHEIC and 11 were opposed, so Tedros decided against sounding the alarm at the time.\n\nThe highest alarm The WHO has declared a \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern,\u2019 or PHEIC, seven times since the alarm system originated in 2005. 2009: H1N1 (swine flu) originates in Mexico and spreads to the United States. 2014: Polio resurges in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. 2014: Ebola virus infections spread throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. 2016: A Zika virus epidemic causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders in the Americas. 2019: An Ebola outbreak spreads in a conflict zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 2020: The first cases of COVID-19 appear in China in late 2019, and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus spreads to many other countries, becoming a pandemic. 2022: Monkeypox infections pop up and spread widely in countries outside Central and West Africa, where they had been slowly circulating for 50 years. Source: This timeline was repurposed from this story, by Amy Maxmen.\n\nDeclaring the monkeypox outbreak a global emergency is a good decision, says Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is a member of the panel and has studied monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for more than a decade. \u201cIt sends the right message, and it will hopefully mobilize attention and resources to prevent this virus from gaining a foothold globally.\u201d\n\nA window closing\n\nResearchers have been warning that the window of opportunity for containing the global monkeypox outbreak is rapidly closing. The virus is already established in an animal reservoir in some parts of Africa, making its eradication a difficult task. One fear is that the virus could spread from humans to animals elsewhere in the world, establishing further reservoirs from which humans could be infected repeatedly.\n\nEven as cases are soaring in Germany, Spain and the United States, some think that containment is still possible, however. The PHEIC signals loudly to public-health officials that the time to act is now, says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this as an endemic virus,\u201d she says.\n\nCountries should work to increase the number of people tested, boost contact-tracing efforts and isolate people as early as possible after symptoms are detected, Rivers adds.\n\nThe PHEIC sends a clear message to countries that their participation in the global response \u2014 which might include sharing vaccines and treatments \u2014 is necessary for containment. The WHO issued guidelines for countries when announcing the alarm, offering recommendations on testing, public-health measures and messaging, travel advisories, infection prevention and control, and global coordination.\n\nContainment concerns\n\nWealthy countries have raced to deploy smallpox vaccines, thought to be highly effective against monkeypox because the viruses that cause these diseases are related. Although some children and women have been infected with monkeypox, almost all the infections in the global outbreak have occurred so far in men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those with multiple sexual partners. This has led public-health officials to focus their messaging and vaccine stockpiles on this population. At first, some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, used a \u2018ring vaccination\u2019 approach, which inoculates the close contacts of people infected with monkeypox to cut off routes of transmission. They then moved quickly to offer the vaccine more widely to high-risk communities, including MSM and health-care workers.\n\nResearchers know that monkeypox spreads mainly through close contact. They are still investigating whether the virus can be sexually transmitted, but it has clearly taken hold in the MSM community. Some members of the WHO panel were reluctant to support a PHEIC declaration because they worried that it would stigmatize that community and hinder efforts to contain the virus. \u201cPeople are not always willing to disclose sexual history\u201d, especially in countries where homosexuality is criminalized, says Boghuma Titanji, an infectious-disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWhile wealthy countries use vaccines for monkeypox, Titanji warns that the ongoing outbreaks in Africa, where there have been more than 70 suspected deaths from the virus this year, \u201ccannot be relegated to a footnote\u201d. (So far, no deaths have occurred in people infected outside Africa.) She hopes that the WHO will promote equity in the global monkeypox response by helping to scale-up surveillance and testing for the virus in Africa, and by allocating money for research and vaccines there. \u201cWe got into this problem by allowing monkeypox to rage on for 50 years in Africa,\u201d she says."

        "Antibody evasion by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.4, & BA.5",
        "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 have surged dramatically to become dominant in the United States and South Africa, respectively1,2. These novel subvariants carrying additional mutations in their spike proteins raise concerns that they may further evade neutralizing antibodies, thereby further compromising the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic monoclonals. We now report findings from a systematic antigenic analysis of these surging Omicron subvariants. BA.2.12.1 is only modestly (1.8-fold) more resistant to sera from vaccinated and boosted individuals than BA.2. However, BA.4/5 is substantially (4.2-fold) more resistant and thus more likely to lead to vaccine breakthrough infections. Mutation at spike residue L452 found in both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 facilitates escape from some antibodies directed to the so-called class 2 and 3 regions of the receptor-binding domain3. The F486V mutation found in BA.4/5 facilitates escape from certain class 1 and 2 antibodies but compromises the spike affinity for the viral receptor. The R493Q reversion mutation, however, restores receptor affinity and consequently the fitness of BA.4/5. Among therapeutic antibodies authorized for clinical use, only bebtelovimab retains full potency against both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5. The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, successively yielding subvariants that are not only more transmissible but also more evasive to antibodies."

        "Infinity and Beyond: The Cosmic Microwave Background",
        "A glow undetectable to the human eye permeates the universe. This light is the remnant signature of the cosmic beginning \u2014 a dense, hot fireball that burst forth and created all mass, energy, and time. The primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has since traveled some 13.8 billion years through the expanding cosmos to our telescopes on Earth and above it.\n\nBut the CMB isn\u2019t just light. It holds within it an incredible wealth of knowledge that astronomers have been teasing out for the past few decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the earliest view we have of the universe,\u201d Princeton University cosmologist Joanna Dunkley previously explained to Astronomy. \u201cAnd it gives us so much information because all the things that we now see out in space \u2014 the galaxies, the clusters of galaxies \u2014 the very earliest seeds of those, we see in this CMB light.\u201d\n\nExtracting these clues from the CMB has taken multiple generations of telescopes on the ground, lofted into the atmosphere, and launched into space. In the mid-1960s, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB\u2019s pervasive microwave static across the sky, it appeared identical everywhere. It would take satellites launched above Earth\u2019s obscuring atmosphere to map that microwave glow to precisions on the order of millionths of a degree. Specifically, three satellites \u2014 COBE, WMAP, and Planck \u2014 revealed that our current cosmos, which is complex and filled with clusters of galaxies, stars, planets, and black holes, evolved from a surprisingly simple early universe.\n\nIn this week's episode of Infinity & Beyond, host Abigail Bollenbach will walk you through the basics of the cosmic microwave background, the universe's oldest baby picture.\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest space and astronomy news, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter."

        "The Hubble Space Telescope captured bright turquoise plumes and nebulous strands of the Tarantula Nebula, which is located within the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n\nBright turquoise plumes ripple through the Milky Way's companion galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, like waves in the ocean in a spellbinding new view shared by NASA.\n\nThe venerable Hubble Space Telescope captured this stunning view of the Tarantula Nebula, which is within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way located about 163,000 light-years from Earth. The LMC is among the closest galaxies to Earth and is visible to the naked eye as a faint cloud in the Southern Hemisphere sky.\n\nThe photo, taken by Hubble in 2014, captures bright, glowing plumes of gas and glittering stars . The turquoise plumes and nebulous strands of the Tarantula Nebula appear to flood the LMC like ocean currents cascading into space.\n\nRelated: The best Hubble Space Telescope images of all time!\n\n\"The Hubble Space Telescope has peeked many times into this galaxy, releasing stunning images of the whirling clouds of gas and sparkling stars,\" NASA officials wrote in a statement .\n\nHowever, \"in most images of the LMC the color is completely different to that seen here,\" the statement says. \"For this image, researchers substituted the customary R filter, which selects the red light, and replaced it by a filter letting through the near-infrared light. In traditional images, the hydrogen gas appears pink because it shines most brightly in the red. Here, however, other less prominent emission lines dominate in the blue and green filters.\"\n\nThis image of the LMC was taken as part of an initiative called the Archival Pure Parallel Project (APPP), which comprises more than 1,000 images taken using Hubble's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and the telescope's other science instruments.\n\nIn turn, the APPP data can be used to study a wide range of astronomical features and effects, including gravitational lensing , cosmic shear, stars of varying mass, and distant galaxies . The data can also be used to supplement observations collected in other wavelengths to paint an even more detailed view of the cosmos."

Our recommendations: It is not necessary to implement mask or social distancing mandates at this time. National surveillance systems should track the underlying cause of hospital admissions.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nRising COVID-positive hospital admissions in the US\n\nIn some jurisdictions in the US, there are rising reported hospital admissions with COVID, and in some cases, examples of rising deaths. This has caused considerable policy discussion about whether it is time to reinstate mandates, such as the consideration of mask mandates in LA County.\n\nThe challenge that we have in understanding what's happening with BA.5 is that this is a very common infection. We see lots of evidence of considerable transmission in the community that is not translating into a big surge in reported cases, largely because we believe there is so much rapid antigen testing at home.\n\nMany COVID hospitalizations are incidental\n\nWe do see rising numbers of hospital admissions, and the challenge \u2013 as we've spoken about before \u2013 is distinguishing incidental, that is people coming to the hospital with some other problem, who happened to be COVID-positive when they get tested, from true COVID admissions. Unfortunately, in this country we don't have data on COVID admissions where they are positive for COVID and that's the reason for admission. Some hospital systems are reporting this.\n\nThere are reports from USC, for example, in LA County, that fully 90% of hospital admissions are incidental, meaning it is quite possible that we don't have reason to be that concerned about BA.5 transmission.\n\nUnlikely to be many cases of severe COVID\n\nIt could well be, because of high levels of immunity in the population from vaccination and from past infection, and quite widespread use of Paxlovid, if we look at the data in the US, that there isn't really cause for concern that there's going to be a large amount of severe COVID. This means, perhaps, that it is not the time, at this point, to be considering imposition of new mandates such as mask mandates or social distancing mandates.\n\nThe situation globally\n\nThis is a phenomenon we're seeing in other countries as well \u2013 it's not unique to the United States. There are reports from New Zealand, for example, in the last few days, of a marked increase in daily deaths. And again, this challenge is there, as well as in many countries in Europe \u2013 Norway is another example \u2013 where incidental from underlying is not being distinguished. It could well be just that BA.5 is a very common infection.\n\nThe only way we're going to resolve this for the future is if national surveillance systems make the effort to track hospitalizations and distinguish them by the underlying cause of admission.\n\nWe remain reasonably positive and optimistic about the course of BA.5 in the US and elsewhere. We do see early signs that it may have peaked already in the US and is starting to come down \u2013 that's not true for every state, but in general it does seem to be following the course that we've seen in other countries around the world.\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.5 is surging around the world, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. We anticipate waves to last around four to six weeks, based on other locations\u2019 experiences.\n\nparticularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. There are several new challenges for accurately tracking the pandemic: More people are using at-home tests and not reporting infections to public health authorities, making it difficult to gather accurate case counts. Countries have different requirements for COVID testing upon hospital admission, leading to variation in rates of hospitalization due to COVID, compared to incidental cases.\n\nOur policy recommendations: Encourage booster shots. Make antivirals available to all, particularly those in low-resource settings. High-risk individuals should consider social distancing and masking as transmission increases. Do not focus on getting vaccines to those who have never been vaccinated.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.5 surges around the world\n\nIn this week\u2019s COVID update from IHME, we\u2019re looking at the surges around the world \u2013 particularly in North America, Latin America, and most of Europe \u2013 that are traced to the combination of mobility levels being above pre-COVID levels, mask use globally down to 16% or less, and of course the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron.\n\nInterpreting the data has new challenges\n\nIt is becoming increasingly challenging to make complete sense of the COVID-19 surges in different countries, as we see very different biases in different countries coming into reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths.\n\nFor reported cases, we're seeing very modest to no increase in some countries in Europe, as compared to hospitalizations. Same in the United States. And we believe that's because of the widespread use of rapid antigen tests at home and in most countries people not reporting that to the public health authorities. They don't get into official case numbers.\n\nIn contrast, for hospital admissions \u2013 if you want an extreme example of this disconnect, look at Norway, where hospital admissions have gone up dramatically and yet cases have gone up only slightly. But for hospital admissions, most countries have required COVID testing for all patients, at least most high-income countries, meaning that you detect a quite substantial number of individuals who have COVID, but have gone to hospital for some other reason. We tend to call these \"incidental\" COVID admissions.\n\nThe degree to which there will be incidental COVID admissions depends on how much transmission there is broadly in the community. So we should expect under Omicron, the problem of incidental hospital admissions is dramatically larger than with a much more severe variant, such as Delta in the past, where there was less transmission in the community, and those coming to hospital who were COVID-positive were much more likely to be there simply because of symptoms of COVID.\n\nSo, challenging interpretation. And if you want to have a contrast to Norway, look at Mexico, where the increase in reported cases is dramatically higher than the increase in hospital admissions. We don't know if that's because there isn't the same testing requirement, of universal testing for COVID for hospital admissions, or if there is less home use of tests. Either way, it's becoming quite a bit harder to make sense of the available data.\n\nShould we be very concerned about BA.5?\n\nProbably not. In the places that started earlier \u2013 South Africa, Portugal \u2013 that had their BA.5 waves begin before other locations, we've seen from the beginning to the peak, it lasts about four to six weeks. So in many cases where countries are three-four weeks into these surges, we do think that we will see \u2013 and the models tend to back up that observation \u2013 we do expect to see peaks coming in the near future. Meaning that there isn't a reason to be particularly alarmed about BA.5,\n\nOur long-range models also suggest in the Northern Hemisphere that we may \u2013 in the absence of a new variant that changes the whole story \u2013 we might expect to see a further winter or late fall Omicron wave start up again in October, and that would be a pattern that we saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhether that happens depends very much on this balance between waning immunity from prior vaccination \u2013 so whether or not people get a fourth booster in places where they have access to that, whether they want a fourth booster \u2013 versus waning immunity from infection and the protection provided from infection with Omicron for either other subvariants or future variants. All of that means to say that it's possible that we have a late-fall surge again from Omicron because of waning immunity.\n\nGovernment policy recommendations\n\nThe strategies available for governments right now are less on getting people who have never been vaccinated, vaccinated. The data out there suggest very few people anywhere in the world who want to be vaccinated have not been, even in low-resource settings. As opposed to the available strategies, which might focus more on getting those who are willing to be vaccinated, who have been previously vaccinated, getting a further booster to enhance their protection against severe disease as that also wanes over time; broader use of antivirals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and then, for those individuals who are at particularly high risk, consideration of social distancing and masking as transmission in your community goes up.\n\nAs a backdrop to all of those strategies, the thing that we are learning, that is, two and a half years into this pandemic, is just how important surveillance is. Paradoxically, in many ways, the data stream that we have today is worse than a year ago because of some of the issues that I started with in this video about home testing, and different definitions of incidental versus underlying COVID for both hospitalization and death. So, very challenging on the surveillance side, but absolutely critical that we keep monitoring the pandemic and trying to do it in as comparable a fashion as possible, and particularly keeping track of new variants. That's our roundup of what we see in our analysis this week in the release of our new forecasts.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nIn the United States , COVID is currently on the decline, but BA.4 and BA.5 could change that. Why? Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Previous infection provides less immunity against BA.4 and BA.5. Mobility is increasing while mask wearing declines.\n\n, COVID is currently on the decline, but could change that. Our recommendations for the US: Individuals should get another COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine before the winter. States should secure antivirals, especially for those at high risk. Governments should continue screening for new variants.\n\nOn a global level, we see a rise in some European countries, including France, Germany, and the UK. The future is still unclear in China, but much of the population remains susceptible to severe infection.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 in the United States\n\nIn the United States, reported cases, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decline. This is the pattern we have seen in the northeastern states. It is spreading across the United States, and we project that this will continue all the way until the end of September, when we are expecting another wave.\n\nWe are concerned in the United States because of the fast spread of BA.4 and BA.5 \u2013 they are escape variants in that it seems from the new studies we are looking at, that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection of BA.4 and BA.5. They are still very effective in preventing severe illness and mortality, but we are concerned that with BA.4 and BA.5 spreading fast with the relaxation of mandates and with the patterns we are seeing in some European countries where there is a third wave, we are concerned that there is potential here for another bump or increase in cases in the coming months.\n\nWe will update our models the second week of July, and we will include all this new information in our models. We will then predict if we see a third wave or not, and how big it will be and how long it will last. In general, we're heading in the right direction in the United States.\n\nOur recommendations for the US\n\nWe're expecting a surge in winter, and the focus right now in the United States should be on vaccinating people and getting the booster, and then getting another vaccination before the winter, especially also with flu. We expect that flu season could be bad because we haven't seen flu in the past three years. Our recommendation would be to take another COVID-19 vaccine before winter and a flu vaccine.\n\nAlso, our recommendation is for every state to secure enough antivirals in order to make sure they are provided to infected people, especially those who are at high risk, elderly, and people with immunocompromise or with risk factors, chronic conditions, to make sure that we reduce the burden on our hospitals and we save lives.\n\nAnd, of course, continue screening and making sure that we don't lose track of what's circulating in our country, and if there is an increase in cases due to another variant or pre-existing variant, we take the measures that are necessary to stop the spread of this virus.\n\nCases rising in Europe\n\nOn the global level, what we are seeing right now is a rise in some European countries. We see a third wave, driven mainly by BA.4 and BA.5, and the relaxation of mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We see the third wave with an increasing number of reported cases, and we see it in France, in Germany, beginning of it in the UK, in Greece, in Israel.\n\nThat's a big concern for us because what has happened before in Europe has happened here in the United States, and we could see here in the United States a third wave, especially from BA.4 and BA.5, which are increasing as a percentage of the variants that are circulating.\n\nWe know right now from several studies that previous infections from other variants do not provide as much immunity against Omicron and BA.4 and BA.5. Also, the vaccines are less effective in terms of preventing infection. They're still effective against severe illness and mortality for BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nSo putting these two together, we are very much concerned that we could see potentially in the United States another wave after the second wave due to BA.4, BA.5, relaxation of the mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing.\n\nWe will update our numbers in July, most likely the second week due to the holiday, and we will take into account all this new information about the spread of BA.4 and BA.5 in Europe, and the new studies that are showing less effect of the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nFuture unclear in China\n\nChina remains a big mystery for us \u2013 we don't know what's going to happen in China. They're successful so far in containing the virus, but this could change as soon as they change their policy and open up the country because they have had fewer infections because of their success before, their vaccine is not as effective, and much of their elderly population is not vaccinated. So we could see a rise of cases in China as well.\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal infections are increasing : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October.\n\n: Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States.

Policy insights and recommendations: Mask mandates in parts of the US are unlikely to have a large effect. We must maintain global surveillance to prepare for the possibility of new variants. Ensure access to antivirals for vulnerable individuals.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nGlobal infections are increasing\n\nIn this week's release from IHME of our COVID forecasts, there are some key observations of what's happening around the world and what we see coming in the models. Globally, we're starting to see the estimated number of infections go up again, and that's driven by secondary Omicron waves in a number of places in sub-Saharan Africa, in a wide array of locations in Latin America, from Quintana Roo, other states in Mexico, through to a number of states in Brazil and all the way in between.\n\nThere are also some small increases in states in India, and perhaps most concerning is a quite substantial secondary wave of Omicron in Portugal, related to the BA.5 variant with an associated meaningful increase in the death rate, which we have not generally seen with these secondary Omicron waves in Europe and the northeast of the US. The last place where there is some secondary increase from Omicron is some of the Southern states in the US and some of the states in the Midwest.\n\nOmicron peak is expected in June\n\nDespite these increases, we remain reasonably sure in the modeling that they will peak sometime in June, given what we've seen in Europe with the secondary waves, and what we've seen in the northeast of the US, as well as what we saw with the BA.4-5 wave in South Africa. So we expect these to be short-lived, and to not really alter the global trajectory over the next few months.\n\nAn outbreak in China could have a major global impact\n\nThe big question mark remains, at the global level, what happens in China. We are assuming that strict lockdown measures will continue through to October, and that they will be, as they have been to date, successful. The reporting of 11 cases today in Shanghai will raise the real questions about the economic toll in China from the strict lockdown policies, but so far there's no indication of a change from the leadership in China.\n\n120,000 deaths expected globally by October 1\n\nPutting all that together in our forecasts, we do not see large numbers of deaths. Although when you add it up around the world, still about 120,000 deaths are to be expected between now and October 1.\n\nThe other insight that comes from the modeling is that we expect to see numbers starting to go back up again in the Northern Hemisphere in early September or late September, likely leading into increases \u2013 modest increases \u2013 in the fall.\n\nMask mandates in the US unlikely to have a big impact\n\nThere is some concern in parts of the US seeing secondary Omicron waves, such as in California, where some mandates have been put back in place, namely mask mandates, for example in Alameda county. As far as we can tell from both the modeling, as well as from the experience elsewhere of the secondary waves, we don't necessarily think that will have a big effect, nor is it necessary given the low infection-fatality rate and given the availability of antivirals, particularly, which should mean that we won't see a substantial increase in death.\n\nSome of the debate about this is getting still obscured, this many months into Omicron, because we are not getting good data that differentiates incidental hospitalizations \u2013 people coming to hospital with COVID-19, but that's not the reason for their hospitalization \u2013 from hospitalizations and deaths where COVID is the true cause. And without that it's very easy for a highly contagious and reasonably prevalent infection like Omicron to appear like the numbers are increasing substantially.\n\nContinuing surveillance for new variants and access to antivirals will be key\n\nClearly all of this optimistic view over the next few months at the global level is predicated on the idea that there will not be a new variant that has immune escape and is more severe than Omicron. But of course, that is a distinct possibility and it highlights why maintaining global surveillance \u2013 so that if such a variant emerges, the world knows about it as soon as possible \u2013 is really crucial, as is preparing for access for the vulnerable for antivirals, because that's likely in the future to be the strategy that will make the biggest difference if a new variant comes along.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal death toll declining: We are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.\n\nWe are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.

Policy recommendation: Monitor for new variants and be prepared to respond if a new, more dangerous one should emerge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Daily death toll declining globally This week at IHME in our update on COVID, we do not have a new model release. That will be coming next week, but we continue to monitor the pandemic. We are really reaching, at the global level, an extraordinarily low level of the impact of COVID. In fact, the death toll at the daily level has now reached the level we last saw around March 20, 2020. We continue to see this very favorable trend down. Low or declining cases in China, South Africa, Europe, and the US At the location level, the strict lockdown policy, zero-COVID strategy in China continues to work, although it has great economic effects. The reported cases, as far as we can tell in China, are now down to a very low level. We do expect in our modeling, and continue to expect, that it will be hard to sustain that, given the considerable number of susceptible individuals that are still in China. Elsewhere, where there were surges related to either BA.4 or BA.5 in South Africa, that's peaked and continues to decline. The BA.2 surges in Europe seem to have all peaked and are pretty much declining. Here in the US, as we expected, at the national level it appears that case reporting has peaked and is starting to come down, but of course that varies by location. The decline is more in the northeast. Other states are still on the upswing, but nationally we should start to see the numbers come down. We do continue to expect, in the absence of the emergence of a variant with considerable immune escape on Omicron, that we will see quite low numbers through the next few months. We must continue monitoring for new variants Of course, we've learned through the pandemic that the emergence of a new variant can completely change the story in a very quick manner. But for now, it does appear like those countries that are largely returning to pre-COVID levels of interaction and very low levels of mask use will continue to see low or even declining transmission, and certainly low or declining impacts in terms of death, given the slow but steady scale-up of the use of antivirals. So, there are very favorable conditions for the moment. We do believe it's important to keep up surveillance and to be ready on a country-by-country basis to respond with booster shots, with access to antivirals, and if a dangerous, high-severity new variant with immune escape emerged, to be able to reconsider other actions as well. May 27, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nSouth Africa & China: Cases appear to have peaked and are now declining.\n\nCases appear to have peaked and are now declining.

Current recommendations:\n\nOffer boosters to those who want them. Provide antivirals to at-risk individuals who get infected. Continue surveillance for potential new variants.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nEvidence of BA.4-5 cross-variant immunity in South Africa\n\nThis week from IHME, we do not have a new release of our models, but we are continuing to track the evolution of the current pandemic. Of major areas of interest, in South Africa, the BA.4-5 related increase in cases has peaked and is coming down, which fits with the expectation that while there was some reduction in cross-variant immunity from BA.4-5 compared to previous waves of Omicron, it was not very large.\n\nOmicron under control in China\n\nLikewise, we're seeing that the measures put in place in China for strict lockdown, at least according to official data, continue to be successful, with case numbers coming down. Of course, the question will be whether or not there are going to be \u2013 as we expect, given the large volume of susceptible individuals \u2013 further Omicron outbreaks, and the need for other efforts at strict lockdown in China, still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases expected to peak in the US within a few weeks\n\nIn the United States, the increase in cases, probably driven by behavioral relaxation, seems to be slowing. There is a spatial heterogeneity aspect to this, but for example, in our own hospital system at the University of Washington, our number of hospital admissions has peaked and is starting to come down, as an example of a place with one of these surges.\n\nSo, as we've been expecting for many weeks, we do not think these current increases in the US will lead to large-scale increases in death, certainly, or hospitalization. We should see a peak about the end of May or early June at the national level.\n\nCurrent recommendations\n\nPending the emergence of new variants that are more severe than Omicron, the current strategies of continuing to offer boosters to those who would like to get a booster, making sure that antivirals are available for those who are at risk who do get infected with Omicron, and continuing surveillance, are the most important aspects of monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nRegional updates: China continues zero-COVID strategy and reports no increase in cases. South Africa may be reaching a peak of the BA.4/BA.5 winter surge. The United States is experiencing an increase in Omicron cases \u2013 likely due to behavioral changes, and possibly due to re-infection with BA.2 \u2013 but not an increase in deaths.\n\nMandates: We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China.\n\nWe do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. Cross-variant immunity: New research suggests limited immunity against other variants after Omicron infection. However, immunity from vaccination and previous infection does provide strong protection from severe illness and death.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nChina reports no increase in cases\n\nWe do not have updated models this week, but we continue to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic around the world. Areas of ongoing interest are the approach to zero-COVID in China, which continues. Officially reported cases are actually not increasing, and they're maybe coming down, but stringent mandates are in place in many locations. From experience in other countries, we do expect at some point that Omicron will spread widely in China, but it is very much a question of when \u2013 and when the government decides to stop pursuing this zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases increasing in South Africa and United States\n\nElsewhere in the world, we're seeing increases. The BA.4- and BA.5-related and winter-related increase in South Africa continues. It is certainly not as exponential as the original Omicron wave, but it does continue to increase. With some indication, it may be reaching a peak.\n\nIn the United States, Omicron continues to increase in a number of states. That increase, again, seems to be like what we've observed in many countries in Europe, related to behavioral relaxation and possibly BA.2 re-infection of people who have had a prior Omicron infection \u2013 although it's perhaps easiest to account for through behavioral change.\n\nMandates not expected to be reimplemented\n\nIn neither case, neither what we saw in Europe nor what we're so far seeing in the United States, are we seeing an increase in death, which is very good news. That's likely because there is either vaccine-derived or infection-acquired immunity, so that people aren't fully immunologically naive, and perhaps because of the increased use of antivirals when individuals do become sick, which should have a marked effect on the death rate. We don't, at this point, think that there's reason for large-scale concern and also do not expect, with few exceptions, that there will be implementation of mandates in these jurisdictions, outside the zero-COVID strategy in China.\n\nNew studies show limited immunity from Omicron infection\n\nOne of the critical factors that do go into the long-range modeling, and even the short-range, is the extent to which Omicron infection provides protection against subsequent new variants, or even sub-variants of Omicron. There was a paper in Nature this week, which is a lab-based paper, based on the immune responses from serum from different types of patients, which suggests that there may be a limited cross-variant protection from Omicron infection.\n\nRead more in Nature \u00bbLimited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination\n\nWe'll really want to wait and see when studies are able to start reporting, from actual infection in individuals, what sort of cross-variant immunity there is. Both from vaccine-derived immunity and infection-acquired immunity, the available studies suggest much lower protection against Omicron infection, pretty good protection against severe disease and death, but greatly reduced for infection. We'll have to wait and see whether that difference holds true for Omicron on Omicron by sub-variant, or even future variants, namely less protection against infection, but hopefully more protection against severe disease and death.\n\nThat issue will have a profound effect on what the fall and winter may look like, as we do expect waning immunity, both from vaccines and infection-acquired immunity, plus indoor exposure and opportunities for transmission, that there should be increased transmission potential in November, December, and January, and the extent to which there is long-range protection from severe disease and death will have a marked effect on outcomes.\n\nMay 16, 2022 - US reaches 1 million COVID deaths\n\nAs the United States reaches this somber milestone, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray reflects on the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how we can better prepare for future health threats.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nThe US has officially surpassed the awful milestone of a million reported deaths from COVID. This is a number that I think very few of us thought would ever come to pass when the pandemic started to break in February of 2020. In fact, back then we thought a concerted response would mean that the number would be a tenth of that, or even less.\n\nNow, the true number of deaths from COVID is even larger. We think, based on looking at excess deaths, it's probably closer to 1.3 million deaths that have already occurred in the US, but by either metric, it's a staggering number.\n\nCOVID has had a terrible toll, not just here in the US but around the world, with 6 million reported deaths and more than 18 million excess deaths; those deaths are distributed throughout the regions of the world and not just in North America or in Europe.\n\nWe've entered a new phase of the pandemic, a phase where Omicron is much milder and a large fraction of the world's population has been infected with Omicron. The Omicron story has still to play out in China and North Korea, but in general we're entering this phase where people are going back to pre-COVID levels of interaction. Mask use is declining dramatically, and I think that's going to be the new normal.\n\nWe will see continued Omicron transmission, and Omicron will come back in the winter if we don't see a new variant. But it's likely we will see a new variant, and so while we might think that the era of mandates and profound changes in behavior might be behind us, we certainly haven't seen the end of COVID-19.\n\nWe should be thinking about how we manage COVID-19 new variants as they emerge and the critical role of continued use of boosters, vaccinating those who are still willing to be vaccinated but haven't been, and the new tools that we have like Paxlovid and potential other antivirals as they come along. All those combined mean, even if we have a new variant, we don't expect it to be as bad as it has been, which is good news. But it should give us pause to recognize the threat that we live with in the future, for either some remarkable new variant that will break through our current tools entirely, or new pathogens and new pandemics in the future.\n\nHopefully, this extraordinary experience in the US will motivate the US government and other governments to invest in greater capabilities to respond to new threats; detect them earlier; have a more rational, thoughtful, but rapid response to those threats as they emerge; and then to figure out who are most vulnerable, whether it's the groups that are essential workers, or those that have some sort of comorbidity, or those that are elderly. Whatever it may be for a new threat, it's critical that we learn about protecting the most vulnerable for future rounds of threats as they emerge.\n\nAt this terrible milestone, it is an opportunity for us to reflect both on what went wrong and how we can solve and prepare ourselves better for future rounds of COVID and future threats.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nEast Asia: As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAs rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. United States: Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Short-term: We predict a small peak in May to early June, but no major surge until the winter. Long-term: We predict as many as 30% of the US population will get infected through the winter with Omicron due to declining immunity. However, we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nCases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Global: Data from South Africa do not indicate that BA.4 and BA.5 will lead to a major global surge. Our recommended strategy for dealing with COVID on a global scale is securing access to antivirals for all.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron and the zero-COVID strategy in East Asia\n\nLast week in IHME\u2019s updated forecasts, we certainly were trying to take into account what\u2019s unfolding in East Asia with continued rapid expansion of the Omicron epidemic in Taiwan, and that continues to expand. There\u2019s this very challenging question of how Omicron will play out in China. The government is pursuing their zero-COVID strategy with lockdowns as needed.\n\nWe have been expecting Omicron, since February, in our modeling to eventually break through these efforts because it has appeared that control efforts on Omicron have been generally less successful around the world than for previous variants. So far, these strict lockdown policies have kept Omicron numbers at a relatively low level.\n\nIt's extremely hard to understand how the policy environment will play out in China. If they pursue strict lockdowns, it's possible they will keep Omicron transmission at a relatively modest level through to the fall. We do believe that it is inevitable there will be a large Omicron outbreak at some point in China, because maintaining a strict zero-COVID strategy is probably unsustainable as the year progresses, but it's impossible to know when that change in policy will occur.\n\nIncreasing cases in the United States and predictions for the winter\n\nIn the US, we're seeing increases in a number of parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, and some of the West Coast, in cases and hospital admissions. This is a pattern that follows what we\u2019ve seen in Europe as people's behavior goes back to pre-COVID levels, and there is a little bit of transition to BA.2 and perhaps BA.4 and BA.5 as they continue to spread.\n\nWe do expect a modest increase in numbers. Our expectation is they will peak sometime in May or early June and then go back down. We don't expect a major surge from that. There have been reports from the White House of their efforts to model in the long term a large surge in infections.\n\nIn our long-range models, which we do not release publicly, we do expect in the winter a return Omicron surge. Of course if there's a new highly infectious variant that's more severe, that would trump this pattern we expect. We expect a surge in the winter because of declining immunity from exposure to Omicron, as well as declining immunity from vaccination and perhaps not as high a rate of repeat boosters as we've seen for the third dose, going into the future. The consequences of a winter surge in the US should be much smaller because of Paxlovid and increasing availability of antivirals and use of antivirals.\n\nWe certainly expect quite large numbers in the winter, not so much in the fall \u2013 perhaps as many as 30% of the US population getting infected through the winter with Omicron. But we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nWe don\u2019t expect much in the way of government mandates, given the much lower ICU admission rate and death rate that should occur with these new strategies, particularly antivirals.\n\nGlobal strategy should be ensuring access to antivirals for all\n\nAt the global level, there's been ongoing debate and concern about BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. There\u2019s not an exponential surge there; there's a very slow increase in numbers. We so far are not seeing any indication that BA.4 and BA.5 could be the driver of a major global surge in cases, but of course this warrants monitoring on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, in terms of general strategy globally, we've seemingly maxed out globally on the number of people who are unvaccinated that want to be vaccinated \u2013 as far as we can tell from the data, only about 3% of the world wants a vaccination that hasn\u2019t received one. A lot of that is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, but still it's not a large percentage of the population.\n\nPerhaps the main strategy to deal with future variants is making sure that anyone who needs antivirals will get access to antivirals. There's a lot in that, both in terms of production of Paxlovid and health system infrastructure, and response patterns so that when somebody needs it, they can get it whether they're in a low-resource or high-resource setting. Those are our main observations on the epidemic as it continues to unfold.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal: Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. 3.1% of the population who wants a vaccine has still not received one, most in Africa. We must ensure equity in distribution of antiviral medication. Eid El-Fitr celebrations in Islamic countries could lead to a small increase in cases.\n\nMortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. United States: Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. Home testing and delayed reporting of infections has made it more difficult to track COVID-19. We recommend: continuing surveillance for new variants, securing antiviral medication, preparing to return to mask use and physical distancing if another variant arises.\n\nReported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. China: The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. The current rise in Taiwan and previous surge in Hong Kong are warning signs of what could happen.\n\nThe large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nProjections and recommendations for the United States\n\nWe have increased our projections to September 1. Right now in the United States we are projecting 1.02 million deaths by September 1. That's an additional 29,000 deaths from May 2, when we ran our programs.\n\nFor the United States, the recommendations remain the same:\n\nWe need to continue our surveillance and make sure we are doing enough sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the United States, and if BA.4 and BA.5 are being introduced in the US and how fast they are spreading. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have enough antiviral medications in order to distribute them. We know from their clinical trials that they reduce hospitalization and mortality, and they will reduce the pressures on our hospitals. Third, which is very important, if we are seeing a rise due to another variant in the United States, we should go back to wearing masks and physical distancing.\n\nIn the United States we are seeing an increase in reported cases and hospitalizations. In some states, we are seeing the rate of increase in admissions to hospital is much higher than the rate of increase of reported cases. We believe that's due to the fact that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting to their counties and not using the local labs, so we are not capturing these cases.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 under study in South Africa\n\nWe are monitoring closely what's happening in South Africa, the infections with BA.4 and BA.5. We don't know yet if they are immune escape and they are infecting people that have been previously infected by BA.2. It's too early to tell, and the fact that many people in South Africa have been infected by Omicron 4-5 months ago, it's possible that the waning immunity is resulting in the infection from BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nChinese population remains susceptible, relying on zero-COVID policy\n\nAt the global level, mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. The global trends are mainly dominated by what's happening in China. Right now we are seeing a rise in cases in Taiwan. China is continuing with its zero-COVID policy and we feel that they will be able to control COVID-19 for a while. However, the economic pressure may not allow them to continue with such a policy.\n\nIf what we are seeing happen right now in Taiwan, or what happened previously in Hong Kong, will happen in China, we project a lot of mortality, unfortunately, and the surge will overwhelm the hospitals. Many older Chinese people are not vaccinated at the same level as other countries, and also the vaccines used in China are less effective than the vaccines used elsewhere, mRNA vaccines. So we would expect a major surge and a rise in mortality in China.\n\nVaccine and antiviral equity: we are not safe until all of us are safe\n\nBased on vaccination rates and our monitoring of people who are willing to take the vaccine, we estimate right now that about 3.1% of people globally who want to get the vaccine and are willing to get the vaccine, have not received it. The majority of them are in Africa. We need to make sure that people who want to get the vaccine are receiving them, who failed distribution, which countries should support poor countries to get the vaccine and vaccinate their population. Again, we're not safe until all of us are safe.\n\nThe most important thing moving forward right now globally is to ensure that the global distribution, like with vaccination, that global distribution for antivirals is going forward and countries can secure what they need from antiviral in order to provide it to people who are infected, to reduce hospitalization and mortality.\n\nProjections in Islamic countries following Eid El-Fitr\n\nWe are not projecting a rise in cases in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean region, WHO region, but we are concerned in many Islamic countries after Eid El-Fitr celebrations with all the mobility, and people are visiting each other and celebrating the holidays. It's possible in some of these countries the decline will slow down and it's possible in some countries that we'll see a small surge in the coming weeks due to the holidays and the celebration.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\nAt IHME, with our projections, our major challenge in the coming months is the delay in reporting. Many countries and many states have moved to weekly reporting and it's very hard for us to monitor the situation. The fact in the United States that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting their infections to the local health departments is making it hard for us to follow the epi-curve.\n\nWe are using admissions to hospitals, COVID-19 admissions, as our main indicator and some places like the United States, where we believe many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting those results to their local health department, we have lowered the infection-detection rate in order to make sure we'll be able to monitor these trends.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nOmicron will continue to spread in China. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAfter already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. Cases are increasing in Delhi, India, and South Africa. The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave?\n\nThe question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? A concerted policy push is needed to increase access to antivirals. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and now a rapid scale-up in production must follow.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron spreading in China\n\nThis week from IHME we are not releasing a new set of projections yet. With few exceptions, the epidemic is still continuing to track our forecasts from earlier in the month. The key areas to pay attention to right now are, first and foremost, what's happening in China with the Omicron wave spreading, most importantly to Beijing. Many other cities within China apparently are also under lockdowns or partial lockdowns.\n\nAs we have been noting for months pre-Olympics, it's really a question of time when Omicron will spread more widely in China, given how transmissible it is, given the comparatively lower efficacy of the vaccines used in China, and particularly this issue that the zero-COVID strategy may not actually work. But our understanding is that the government will pursue that strategy vigorously, at least until the fall. So, no real change in expectations there, but it simply will be a challenging question as to whether that strategy can hold out until the fall.\n\nIncreasing cases in India\n\nThe second area of concern that people have been tracking has been the steady uptick in cases in Delhi, India. The question is whether this is due to declining immunity from the prior Omicron wave or the possibility of one of the sub-variants of Omicron fueling transmission in Delhi. They have re-imposed their mask mandate, so we\u2019ll see if that has some effect on that one part of India and the surrounding state of Haryana having some increased transmission.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 variants in South Africa\n\nThe third area of concern is the uptick in South Africa associated with the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, a steady increase but not exponential. The question remains \u2013 is that because these sub-variants are more transmissible, or is it because they have immune escape over BA.1 and BA.2, which were there in South Africa and had become the predominant variants, or is it because of waning immunity, just through time. We are now, for South Africa, pretty much four months, or even four and a half in some provinces, after the peak of the Omicron wave.\n\nAccess to antivirals\n\nThe other main consideration globally around managing COVID, particularly in China and for the world, when new variants that are potentially more severe emerge, is access to Paxlovid. We\u2019ve started to finally see some policy discussion around the importance of availability and access to Paxlovid. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and the question is, will there be more rapid scale-up in production? We strongly believe that needs a concerted policy push, equivalent to the efforts to expand vaccination. We will certainly expect more from IHME as we run our models in the near future to reflect any new updates in the data as we\u2019ve been describing.\n\nDo you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about.\n\nAsk a question\n\n\n\nDue to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of Omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected].\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNew modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference.\n\nWe are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. Cases are rising in the eastern United States , but deaths are not. Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate.\n\n, Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. Still unknown if lockdowns will prevent an Omicron surge in China. Low vaccination among the 80+ population could result in a huge death toll if an outbreak occurs.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nLockdowns and Omicron in China This week from IHME, we have not rerun our models. We have been spending time trying to understand the epidemic province by province in China. The key thing there as the outbreak continues to unfold in Shanghai with very broad-based transmission, is now reports of lockdown are confirmed by mobility data in many other cities within China. It remains to be seen whether the zero-COVID strategy will work to keep COVID, or the Omicron variant, from spreading very widely in China. What we do know is that vaccine coverage in the 80+ population in many provinces is quite low. If Omicron spreads widely, there is a real risk that what we saw in Hong Kong could re-occur in mainland China. That's something that we are watching very closely. Currently, our models are assuming that the success that China's had with the zero-COVID strategy controlling Omicron in February, around the time of the Olympics, could be replicated, but we're also hearing reports that the economic costs of this are rising. Cases on the rise in eastern United States For the United States, we're seeing rising case numbers in a number of eastern states. There's some suggestion of rising case numbers in other states as well. There has not been a precipitous rise in case numbers yet \u2013 this increase looks to be related to continued relaxation of behavior, combined with the BA.2 sub-variant. The good news there is we're not seeing an increase in deaths. But it does point out how critical in the US \u2013 and pretty much everywhere \u2013 access to antivirals is going to be. New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges While there continues to be a lot of discussion about access to vaccines in low- and middle-income countries and even discussion around boosters, there's perhaps not enough focus on making sure that people who need these highly effective antivirals like Paxlovid [can get them] in the future. This is somewhat important right now for the BA.2 sub-variant, but could be extremely important in the future as we imagine that there will be more infectious and potentially more severe variants that emerge during the course of this year. We have started to do some modeling of what would happen if a variant that was as severe as Delta came along with the transmission potential of Omicron, and in that setting, widespread access to an antiviral like Paxlovid really makes a profound difference in saving lives around the world. So a very high priority, both in the US and everywhere in the world, for thinking about health system delivery strategies and access to the drug itself, is that those who can benefit from an antiviral are going to get that antiviral. Expect more from us in the coming weeks as we continue to track the pandemic and try to model out how future scenarios unfold, both with what we know is currently occurring, but also potentially the emergence of new variants. Emergence of new sub-variants The last comment is on the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants in South Africa. They are replacing BA.2 and there is some increase in case numbers, but still modest so far, as distinct from what happened with BA.2. We're now four months or more into the peak of Omicron transmission, so some of that increase in BA.4 and BA.5 could be from waning immunity from what was established through the early Omicron wave in November and December in South Africa. But it\u2019s clearly another facet of the epidemic that will bear close monitoring. April 14, 2022 - Update from Dr. Ali Mokdad\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.2 surge is ending in Europe.

For those who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors: continue wearing a mask and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nCases are declining in Europe Globally, we are seeing a decline in reported cases in the majority of countries, and the short surge that has happened after the Omicron surge in some European countries is declining. So we see a decline in reported cases right now in the UK, in Germany, in France. In the long run, we believe that the number of cases will keep declining all the way to next winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Surge predicted in China if precautions fail: only 30% of population currently immune The situation we are monitoring closely right now is what\u2019s happening in China. We believe the strict measures and the lockdown in China have been successful so far in containing the spread of the virus, but with Omicron being extremely contagious and spreading much faster than any previous variant we have encountered, we don\u2019t believe that China could contain the spread of Omicron for a long time. So we\u2019re expecting a rise of infections, reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in China if these measures that are in place right now are not successful in containing the spread of the virus. The reason we believe that for China \u2013 if you look at measures that China put in place, they were so effective at preventing infection. Right now in China, about 2% of the public has been infected by COVID-19 since the beginning of COVID-19, compared to 76% of us here in the United States. So we have more immunity than people in China, we have better vaccines with mRNA, and we have a higher vaccination rate, especially among the elderly population. Not for the general population, but for the elderly population in the United States we have a higher vaccination coverage. So when you put all of these together, in the United States we have about 73% of the public that is immune to Omicron, compared to 32% in China. So any outbreak in China, simply because there are about 70% of the public in China that are susceptible to Omicron, we expect a rapid surge of cases, similar to what we are seeing in Hong Kong and in other countries as well. Mobility is increasing, while mask wearing and testing decline More countries are relaxing their mandates right now \u2013 for example, New Zealand and Australia opened their borders to each other and travel is allowed right now. This could have an impact on reported cases as people are traveling and feel they are free to travel right now. Mask wearing is the lowest since we started reporting on mask wearing and since IHME started promoting mask wearing and providing scenarios showing how effective masks are in preventing mortality. So we're at less than 25% right now when it comes to mask wearing \u2013 it varies by countries, but mask wearing has dropped a lot because many countries relaxed their mask mandates, especially in Europe. Testing is declining in many countries: for example, in the UK, they're not paying anymore for testing, so we're seeing a decline in testing. That will impact our ability to track the pandemic in many countries and many locations. Some countries and states have decided to release data on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis, so the quality of data, the timeliness of data has changed, and that will impact our ability to track \u2013 not only us, but other groups who are doing similar projections \u2013 our ability to track the pandemic moving forward. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative Globally, there is a need to secure more antiviral medication and make sure it is available to every country to save lives and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals and protect the medical system. In countries where we see a surge of cases, recommending people to wear a mask and observe physical distance will be important. And in many countries in the world, it's very important to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, especially those who are not yet vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised and have health conditions. Our data right now show that a small percentage of people globally who want to get a vaccine or are willing to take the vaccine have not been able to receive the vaccine. The majority are in Africa. Therefore, it's very important to share vaccines with countries where people are willing to take the vaccine and they're waiting to get their vaccine. This is the only way for all of us to save lives and stop the spread of the virus, and of course we're not safe until all of us are safe. In the United States, the BA.2 variant is causing small rise in cases, but no surge expected In the US, we are seeing a slight rise in reported cases in some states, but we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in some European countries here in the US, simply because in the United States we have more immunity due to higher rates of previous infections in the country. BA.2 right now is the main circulating variant here in the United States \u2013 about 86% of the variants that are circulating in the US are BA.2. But because of previous infections in the US and our immunity, we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in Europe. The extension of the mask mandate on public transportation at the federal level and on airplanes will help a lot, especially right now with spring break vacations and people traveling. Many families are traveling for the first time with their children right now since the start of the pandemic, so one would expect, with the increased mobility and the fact that mask wearing is less than 25% in the US, that we'll see a slight increase in reported cases in the United States. We still believe that the pandemic phase of COVID-19 is over, simply because we have higher infections here in the United States and hence higher immunity. We are improving our vaccine and we soon should be able to have vaccines that are designed for the new variants; the vaccines that we have right now are highly effective, but we need to remember they were designed for the [ancestral] variant. And of course we have antiviral medications that will save lives and prevent hospitalization. If there is a surge from an escape variant, we can always go back to physical distancing and mask mandates and ask the public to wear a high-quality mask and avoid large gatherings. Recommendations for controlling the virus in the US The recommendations in the United States to contain the virus and the epidemic of this virus in the country remain the same: secure antiviral medications, distribute them, make sure patients can access them in a short time to save lives and prevent overwhelming our hospitals; maintain our surveillance system and also our genetic sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the US and, if there is a rise in cases, where it's happening and among whom, especially if they are vaccinated or not, so we can tell as soon as possible if the new variant is an escape variant and the vaccines are not as effective against it. For the public who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors, they need to remain more vigilant and wear a mask, especially if they are in close indoor settings with a large crowd. And all of us, if there is a surge and a new variant that is circulating, we also need to put our masks back on and make sure we maintain a physical and safe distance in order to reduce the chance of getting this virus. In the short term, the coming few months in the United States, IHME is projecting a decline after this tiny little surge, a decline of cases all the way until next winter, short of a new variant appearing.

Our long-term projections for the United States show a rise in cases next winter but a small bump in some states, similar to what we are seeing right now in Europe. But in general in the US, we project a decline that will continue all the way until next winter. What we need to do in the United States is to remain vigilant, of course. COVID-19 is not over; the pandemic phase of it is over. We need to be very careful, especially those who have a risk factor or are immunocompromised. Fourth vaccine dose recommended for those aged 50+ The FDA has approved a fourth dose for people who are above 50. It\u2019s very important for all of us who are above 50, including myself, to go and get number four. It will help a lot in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, especially if you have received your second dose or your third dose more than five months ago. Why is Europe seeing a second wave, and will the same happen in the US? As far as what\u2019s happening in Europe, we know that the second wave in Europe after the peak of Omicron was due to BA.2 spreading, change of behavior, and waning immunity. In the United States, because we have higher infection compared to Europe \u2013 for example, compared to the UK \u2013 we have lower vaccination but more infections. With the combination of the two, we have more immunity in the United States, especially in the Southern states, where they had more infections than we\u2019ve seen in the UK. So we will not expect a big bump in the US. There may be a very minor one in some states, but a decline overall. What the US needs to do is to secure more antiviral medication and keep it and distribute it right now to places ahead of the next surge. And make sure we have a plan for distribution based on risk factors and the aging of the population in each location, but also to have a plan for redistribution in case we have a wave in one state and medication sitting in a warehouse in another state. So, shifting resources is very important for preparedness. We believe that before winter, because of waning immunity, another shot may be needed as well, depending on whether people have received four or three doses. Still, in the US, vaccination is not increasing, and unfortunately we have leveled at about 65% at the national level. Risk of cruises and other activities varies by personal factors CDC has announced that it's ok to get on a cruise ship. I believe it's safe, in my opinion, if you are vaccinated and boosted, and now if you are above 50 and getting the fourth dose. But of course, for all of us, whatever we do from now on has to be based on our own personal risk and the risk of people we live with or we are around. So basically, for somebody who\u2019s young and healthy, the risk is very minimal to get Omicron or BA.2, but for somebody who's older in age, has a risk factor, or is immunocompromised, the risk is much higher. Of course, we have to behave accordingly to protect ourselves and the people we live with and we care about. That's very important. The BA.2 wave is coming to an end in Europe As far as the global landscape, what we are seeing right now in Europe and many countries, the second peak has happened, and it's starting to come down \u2013 in the UK, for example. It\u2019s still going up in France as of today, coming down in the Netherlands, so in many European countries, that second peak lasted about 3-4 weeks and came down. This was driven mainly by BA.2 and the change of behavior. In Europe, they had more mandates than we did here in the United States, and then there was a sudden change of behavior, more so than in some states here in the United States where we didn't have any mandates, Florida for example. So basically, the behavioral change that has happened after the peak of Omicron is minimal in the United States compared to what we've seen in Europe. China continues to keep Omicron at bay China is the country that we are keeping an eye on right now. China so far has been able to contain the spread of Omicron in Beijing by lockdown and massive testing. Whether they will be able to do so and maintain that control in Shanghai and other large cities is a big question mark. BA.2 and Omicron are more infectious, so we believe the chances of containing the spread of Omicron in China will be very limited. Our long-term projections in China show that they will have a major surge coming up with a peak in May, towards the end of May, with a large number of hospitalizations and mortality, for several reasons. China has a high vaccination rate, but their vaccine is not as effective as the vaccines we are using here in the United States or in European countries. So what China needs to do is \u2013 and we know they have right now received the permit to produce mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, and they have their own mRNA vaccine being developed right now \u2013 so producing more vaccines and vaccinating people, especially the elderly in China, because we know there are reports that vaccination among the elderly is very low compared to what we have seen in other countries. Second, is to produce more antivirals, and we know that they have right now licenses to produce antiviral medication and distribute it in China. Preparing their hospitals for the surge is very important right now. Vaccine donations are still appreciated, but only if they have a long shelf life Vaccine donations have saved a lot of lives all over the world, and countries have been generous in providing extra doses of vaccines to others who need it. It's very important to remember as you donate these vaccines to make sure they have a long shelf life. They shouldn't be about to expire. Once you give a vaccine to a country, there are a lot of logistics and distributions and manpower that's needed to administer these vaccines. Indonesia, for example, has asked all donors, please when you give us a vaccine let's make sure it has a long shelf life. We need to keep that in mind and not waste vaccines. Thank you everybody for donating the vaccine, but let's make sure the vaccine can be used by the country that is receiving them in time before they expire.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nFour zones of Covid transmission in the world Majority of countries: transmission continues to decline Western Europe: secondary increase in transmission from BA.2 Southeast Asia: peak Omicron wave China: not yet experienced an Omicron wave, but we anticipate it will arrive in the next few months, causing up to a million deaths\n\nBA.2: Countries that have already dealt with BA.2 transmission (Netherlands, Denmark) saw brief surges that ended reasonably quickly. That pattern may spread to the rest of Western Europe and North America. Increased transmission is likely due to a combination of BA.2 and reduced mask use and social distancing.\n\nUkraine: there will likely be increased transmission due to the ongoing war and crowded conditions, but the impact may be reduced because of high levels of prior immunity in the population.\n\nPolicy recommendation: We should shift focus away from vaccination and towards production and distribution of anti-virals like Paxlovid. Can reduce death rate by 90% More likely to maintain effectiveness against new variants that may come in the future\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIn this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first thing to recognize is that there are really four zones of Covid transmission right now in the world. In the vast majority of countries, transmission continues to decline, as countries come off the peaks of Omicron transmission. Western Europe is experiencing a second wave in transmission from BA.2 As there has been quite a bit of media attention, there is a secondary increase in transmission in some countries in Western Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Greece, are places where transmission is on the increase. That increase is being attributed to the substitution of the BA.2 variant for the BA.1 variant, combined with reduced mask use and social distancing. We don't think it's just BA.2, because BA.2 has actually been around for quite some time. In fact, for example in South Africa, it appeared in December. It's replaced BA.1 but there's been no substantial increase in community level transmission. We don't think \u2013 and you see this in our forecasts \u2013 that this combination of BA.2 and reduced caution about transmission will lead to a prolonged secondary surge. The reason is the surge in the Netherlands \u2013 it went up, then came back up, and now the secondary surge has already peaked and is on its way down. In Denmark, the BA.1 and BA.2 parts sort of coalesced into one and that also came to an end reasonably quickly. We think that will be the pattern that we'll see in other countries in Western Europe, and it's possible that pattern will spread to the United States and Canada as well. Southeast Asia is in peak Omicron wave The third zone are those countries still in the main upswing, or peak levels of transmission due to a delayed Omicron wave. Those are mostly in Southeast Asia \u2013 Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples of that. And then the biggest driver of transmission, cases, and potentially deaths, is what's playing out in the zero-Covid strategy countries, so New Zealand looks to have hit their peak on Omicron, but it's coming down quite slowly. China has not yet seen an Omicron wave And then the big, big question is China. Because we've seen in an immunologically naive population with not good vaccination coverage in the elderly, quite a toll in Hong Kong. And now the question is when and if that will spread to mainland China. There are outbreaks in multiple cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other locations. The Chinese government is still pursuing the strategy of lockdown for a short period and then multiple rounds of mass testing to identify all cases and then quarantine them. This worked in Beijing in February to stop transmission and they are trying to pursue this for now, but the economic consequences are very great and there's greater calls within the Chinese leadership for less of a stringent policy. We predict next wave in China could be devastating Our model foresees that that can't go on for that long and so we have a huge peak, with perhaps as many as a million deaths in China coming through in April, May, and into June. The timing of that will depend critically on how the Chinese government chooses to either relax or not their zero-Covid strategy. The other key issue that could mitigate the huge death toll that could be coming in China is the recent announcement of an IP waiver from Pfizer for Paxlovid for producers in 22 countries, including five producers in China. So there's an interesting strategic choice that will play out, which is that the balance of the economic harm of the aggressive zero-Covid strategy and creating time to produce anti-virals that would be sufficient to protect some of the unvaccinated elderly within China. The timing and how that plays out is going to be up to the policy choices in China. The importance of anti-virals If we step back and zoom out more globally, there's still a tremendous amount of energy in trying to address vaccine inequality and addressing supply constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa around vaccination. That's certainly well-justified on moral grounds \u2013 everybody should have access to vaccination who wants it \u2013 but may not have a huge effect on death and hospitalization. We see in the data in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, that cumulative infection rates are quite high \u2013 80-90% of most countries have already been infected, they have immunity from infection, and also vaccine hesitancy is quite high. So even if the supply constraints are addressed \u2013 which they should be, on moral grounds \u2013 we should not expect that to make a huge effect on this 6-month timeframe of hospitalizations and death rates. However, what we don't see is similar international energy on the crucial issue of access to anti-virals, because anti-virals like Paxlovid can reduce the death rate by 90% and production capacity is small. With the new IP waivers going to India and China and some other countries, perhaps we can have a more concerted global effort in giving access to everybody who needs it, particularly the elderly, to anti-virals. That could really change the course of Covid over the next 12 months. The other aspect of the anti-virals scale-up that is important to recognize is that we don't really know if current vaccines will do much for future variants. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, particularly transmission, has been quite low with current vaccines. Whereas we suspect that the pathway that the anti-virals use will stay preserved and so the anti-virals will be an effective strategy irrespective of the type of variants that may come. So, as we step out and go into this phase where it's very unlikely that we'll see mandates and social distancing mandates as a main strategy for control. Then it's really down to vaccination and anti-virals. We've had lots of push on vaccination, and now we need equal policy attention and drive on the anti-virals. Covid in Ukraine Lastly, of course there is a real interest and attention on what might be the consequences on Covid of the war in Ukraine. Very difficult to assess, because of course the information systems have fallen apart amid the setting of the incredible destruction and invasion that is underway. But, one aspect of it that may mean the effect of millions of refugees crowding, lack of opportunities to social distance, may not be as bad as it might have been, is that despite low vaccination rates in the Ukraine, they have very high levels of prior infection, so there is quite a substantial amount of immunity. Of course, there will be increased transmission. We probably won't get any data about it, but hopefully the impact will be much less than if they had been a truly immunologically naive population.\n\nMarch 4, 2022 - COVID-19 impact on women's equality\n\nPresented by Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women in terms of employment & income loss, gender-based violence, and returning to school.\n\nPolicy action : Governments should incentivize girls going back to school and prioritize the areas of life most affected in their region.\n\nRead the research article.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIt's really important, as we move past the latest wave of Omicron deaths and infections, to pay a lot of attention to the other areas of life and society that the pandemic has had a big pull on. In our study, we measured the impacts of the pandemic on some of these areas, particularly on employment and education, on income loss, on foregoing utilizing other health care for one\u2019s needs, and particularly how those may have disproportionately affected women compared to men around the world.\n\nAs the world moves on to the next phase, it is really important to consider all other aspects of life that the pandemic has had a big impact on, not only the direct effects on deaths and infections that we have been living with over the past two years.\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women when it comes to employment loss, to income loss, to increased perceptions of gender-based violence, and also with regard to education and who is returning to school compared to who is dropping out of school.\n\nRead \u00bbCOVID-19 Led to Worse Social and Economic Consequences for Women published in Think Global Health\n\nEven though there are a lot of areas that the pandemic has affected, our findings only scratch the surface of what the real impact of the pandemic may have been, as we have only been able to explore a few of these areas. But we think that the impact of the pandemic has been broad and is going to be felt for years to come.\n\nIt has been widely discussed that the effect of the pandemic on schools and on education is very profound. Sadly, we have very little data to measure what is happening right now to the millions of learners around the world, but from what we know, we are quite concerned that as societies and schools go back to normal, girls will be returning to education at a lower rate compared to boys. This happened after previous crises, and there are some indications that it is happening again as a result of COVID school closures. It is really important that societies and governments prioritize incentivizing girls going back to school and returning to education now that schools are reopening again.\n\nOur study is the first study that has taken a comprehensive lens to the impact of the pandemic on gender disparities. While we have not answered all the questions, we\u2019re hoping that policymakers will look at the most important areas of society and life that have been affected by COVID with respect to gender disparities in their own country, and prioritize what they should be addressing first. In some regions of the world, the most severe impact has been felt on employment loss; in other regions of the world, education should be prioritized. We\u2019re hoping that our study will contribute information needed as we move to the next phase of life and COVID-19, to prioritize the areas where the gender gaps are most pronounced and most severe.\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCOVID anomalies: Cases on the rise: Russian Federation and Belarus Cases declining faster than expected: the Caribbean and South America Cases increasing again after a decline: Finland, Sardinia, Canada (Manitoba province)\n\nChina: Omicron wave has not yet hit, but we expect that will change by March or April.\n\nFunctional immunity: We\u2019re updating the model to reflect patterns in immunity from vaccination, previous infection from Omicron, or previous infection from other variants.\n\nUnited States: About \u00be of the population is currently immune to Omicron.\n\nWhat does the future hold? We expect there to be intensified transmission next winter and more variants will likely emerge.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nWhere cases have continued to rise This week\u2019s update from IHME on modeling and analyzing the COVID epidemic: First, in terms of what\u2019s happened around the world that is not following the trajectory that we expected, the only major observation on that front is that the increase in cases in the Russian Federation and perhaps Belarus has continued to rise. We expected because we\u2019ve estimated past infection levels to be very high, they should have run out of people to infect, but they\u2019ve kept going. So we expect that peak should come soon, but of course the fact that it has kept going may imply that levels of past infection have not been as high as we\u2019ve previously expected. Where cases are declining faster than expected The second observation is that the Omicron wave is going down faster in some regions than we expected, or somewhat faster. The Caribbean stands out \u2013 actually South America in general stands out \u2013 in declining faster than perhaps we expected. Where cases are increasing again after a decline There are a handful of anomalies that we are observing around countries where after a decline, cases have gone back up. Finland is included in that, Sardinia would be in that group, Manitoba province in Canada. In each of these, we\u2019re not sure what the explanation is \u2013 could be a local phenomenon around increased transmission or spatial spread. In the case of Finland, it may be the same thing that happened in Denmark \u2013 the spread of the BA.2 variant. But certainly, these are not happening in a large number of locations and seem to be specific to those particular places. The situation in China Our global numbers do look different because of China, where we expected that by now the Omicron epidemic would have taken hold more broadly in the community and we would be seeing widespread transmission. The public health authorities in China, through vigorous lockdowns, have been able to stop transmission in Beijing. We are therefore pushing out later into March and April what we continue to expect will happen \u2013 which is that there will be a widespread Omicron wave. At the global level, that makes a difference. How we\u2019re factoring in functional immunity The last thing to note is that as part of our analyses, we are going to be including what\u2019s in the models for quite some time: the fraction of people in each population that have got functional immunity to Omicron. That immunity comes from vaccination, even though vaccines are only partially effective for blocking Omicron infection; it comes from past infection with other variants; and it comes from infection with Omicron. In each case, we compute that functional immunity, taking into account the pattern of waning for vaccination and for natural infection, and the cross-variant immunity, or the breakthrough that Omicron has against prior variant infection. When you put all that together, in a place like for example the United States, we see about three-fourths of the population currently are immune to Omicron. We expect that number will continue to grow as we go through this tail-end of the Omicron wave in the United States. Does that mean that so many people are immune to Omicron that we will see no further transmission or waves of COVID in the future? The answer is no, because we will have \u2013 if no new variant emerges \u2013 we would expect Omicron to return next winter. There will be more waning of immunity, more people will have gone back to being susceptible, and we\u2019d be back into winter intensified transmission. Of course, we do think variants will emerge, and so further increases or outbreaks are likely as the new variants emerge that have immune escape and can infect people who are currently immune to Omicron. We don\u2019t expect those new variants, however, to have the same consequence that the Delta variant had last year. Because global levels of immunity are going to be much higher and there\u2019s the advent of access, which we hope will eventually be global, to antivirals, which will substantially reduce the infection-fatality rate. Those are the main insights from this week\u2019s analysis. February 10, 2022 - Q&A with Dr. Murray\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nIncorporating incidental COVID deaths into the model is still a work in progress : We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track.\n\n: We are working on compiling data for all the jurisdictions we track.

It will be difficult for zero-COVID countries, like China, to keep Omicron at bay. The new variant is so transmissible that even lockdowns will not hold it off for long.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nHow will your model account for incidental COVID deaths? We know from a variety of community-level studies \u2013 hospital pre-admission screenings, some cohort studies in India, the ONS [UK Office for National Statistics] infection survey \u2013 that Omicron comes with a very high prevalence in the community, as high as 10% or 12% of the population shedding virus at any one time. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the incidental hospital admissions and deaths. The challenge as we dig into this is jurisdiction. By jurisdiction, the way incidental admissions and deaths are being counted appears to be different. And so, at present, we're not able to understand this difference for every jurisdiction. We are starting to compile the data as provided, or the guidance as provided, by each jurisdiction, but since we track nearly 400 different jurisdictions, counting the subnational units in many countries, it's going to be quite a task for us to fully understand this. But it's a work in progress. How has IHME\u2019s approach to COVID-19 forecasting changed? The IHME approach to modeling the epidemic has kept progressing as the epidemic unfolded. Our very first model in March of 2020 was really driven by the experience observed in Wuhan and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions there on transmission. We then transitioned to a transmission dynamics model with other drivers, mask use, mobility, testing, and a bunch of contextual factors such as smoking, air pollution, and altitude, population density, and a variety of other factors. And then we had to modify the model to take into account vaccination, and then the spread of variants with the emergence of the Alpha variant. And then finally, the big change that's come in the last few months has been taking into account waning of infection-acquired immunity and waning of vaccine-acquired immunity. We're trying to keep abreast of what the virus is showing us and the complexity of what's happening around the world. I think part of the reason that our out-of-sample predictability or model performance has continued to be quite good is because we are trying to essentially keep up with the virus while we learn about it. What will be the consequences of removing mask mandates? Right now, in countries where Omicron is subsiding, there's a pretty rapid move to lift mandates. We're seeing it in some US states, Canadian provinces, many countries in Europe, and discussion elsewhere of similar moves. I think removing the mandates makes sense in settings where we think that most people who are susceptible to Omicron have been infected and the numbers are coming down because we've run out of people to infect. In those settings, the mandates aren't really achieving much at all. And so there should be little to no risk in removing those mandates. In settings, which we don't see a lot of, where there is a lot of behavioral modification, people are avoiding contact, mobility has come way down, and mask use has gone up, then perhaps some of the peaks in Omicron may have been before all the people who are susceptible have been infected \u2013 and then you might get a secondary resurgence if you take the mandates off. But there are not many places where the other data on mobility and mask use would suggest that that's really the driver of the peak, in which case we think removing the mandates will have little to no impact on transmission once you're on the downswing of Omicron. Should China relax its restrictions, and what will happen if it does? The big question with Omicron is what do zero-COVID countries, most importantly China, do? And it's really quite a challenge because we worry most about people who are unvaccinated and never infected, so essentially there's almost nobody in China who's been infected, except a very small percentage of the population from the original outbreak. And you have quite high vaccination rates, but the vaccine isn't particularly effective against Omicron. It's much worse efficacy than say Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca. The challenge that the Chinese government has is how to manage this situation. If there's a strategy ahead where they can deliver a more effective vaccine booster to the over-65s and under-65s with comorbidities \u2013 the vulnerable group \u2013 or they can gain access to intellectual property around antivirals and start producing enough antivirals to start producing a big caseload, then that becomes a way out. You keep up with the rolling lockdowns in each place where an Omicron outbreak occurs until you're ready with those other strategies. But if there isn't going to be that strategy, then continuous rolling lockdown \u2013 because we expect Omicron will just keep reemerging because it's so infectious \u2013 probably becomes infeasible. Right now, that choice on strategy is probably what the Chinese leadership is trying to figure out. We don't think it's feasible to keep Omicron out of the community for very long, because even the non-pharmaceutical interventions that worked well for Delta, for previous variants, for the ancestral variant, don't work so well for Omicron because it's so transmissible. And so it's going to be difficult, even with lockdowns, to keep it under control. February 4, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nOmicron wave continues: We expect most locations to have peaked and begun to decline by the end of March.\n\nReported cases are lower than expected in some locations. This could be a result of lower testing capacity or higher numbers of unreported previously infected individuals who are now immune.\n\nVariation in incidental Omicron deaths: There is significant variation between hospitals in how deaths are reported among those who were admitted for a different reason and then later tested positive for Omicron. This produces an inconsistent infection-fatality rate.\n\nImpact of BA.2: There is no indication that BA.2 is more severe than BA.1, but this could prolong the spread of the Omicron wave or cause secondary surges.\n\n\n\nThere is no indication that BA.2 is more severe than BA.1, but this could prolong the spread of the Omicron wave or cause secondary surges. Summer and early fall should be a time of low transmission in the Northern Hemisphere, but we must continue surveillance for new variants and prepare for the possibility of another surge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity The global landscape of COVID-19 currently In this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 epidemic, at the global level, our forecasts remain very similar to the past one. Basically, the huge Omicron wave continues to sweep through the world. We\u2019re seeing in some [locations], but not all, rapid declines after hitting a peak, and we expect that the epidemic will have largely swept through the world now by the end of March \u2013 a little bit longer than previously thought because the Omicron wave in China seems to be not yet taking off, and that is such a large population that it does affect the global epidemic. Within that story, however, there are some interesting patterns that are worth noting and add to the complexity of the story. In some countries \u2013 Greece is a good example, England is another \u2013 the epidemic has reached a peak, come down, and then about halfway down it\u2019s leveled out. I think the best explanation we can find for this phenomenon is that each place is having the classic peak we see in an island state like Malta or Hawaii or Puerto Rico, where you go straight up and come straight down, but those up and down phenomena are spread spatially throughout each of these countries, and so in aggregate you tend to see this spike go up, come down, and then a flat period. So we expect eventually those numbers will shoot down. It does mean that at the national level, we may see somewhat more protracted epidemics than we expected. Reported cases are lower than expected The other phenomenon that we\u2019re seeing in some countries is that the peak that we\u2019re expecting to see in reported cases is much lower than our models would have suggested. We\u2019re seeing this in a number of middle-income countries, some states in India, some states in Brazil. We think this is where testing capacity is simply being overwhelmed at the peak of the epidemic, and so we\u2019re getting a sort of truncated peak. We\u2019ve just run out of the ability to detect cases or, put in other language, the infection-detection rate as the surge comes through is dropping even faster than we expected, because of exceeding testing capacity. Proving that is hard, but it is probably the only way we can account for these early peaks that are smaller than expected, given everything we know about each country in terms of vaccination levels, past exposure to previous variants, and the waning of immunity. Variation in infection-fatality rates caused by incidental Omicron infections The third phenomenon that we\u2019re seeing in the data, which complicates things quite a bit \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about it before, but we\u2019re getting clearer and clearer evidence about it \u2013 is that countries vary considerably in how they are reporting so-called incidental Omicron infections in hospitalized patients and in deaths. We\u2019ve dug into the details from some jurisdictions, and it\u2019s clear that in some jurisdictions the recommended rules are clearly to count what are called suspect cases, which is anybody who is hospitalized or dies who\u2019s tested positive in the last 60 days. Some countries use a different period \u2013 30 days in other places. And so that\u2019s including a lot of people, given how common Omicron is, who are admitted and die from other causes. Eventually they will go back and revise their death numbers as death certificates come in and there is adjudication and investigation, or at least in many places. B"

        "Are Companies Scrapping COVID Therapies for Monkeypox?",
        "Over the weekend, the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak, so far documented in more than 70 countries, a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern [PHEIC].\u201d\n\nHere are the initiatives some biopharma companies are taking to contain monkeypox.\n\nTonix Moves from COVID-19 to Monkeypox\n\nOne of the companies leading the charge against monkeypox is New Jersey-based Tonix Pharmaceuticals, which owns TNX-801, one of the leading vaccine candidates for the prevention of monkeypox.\n\nTonix saw its shares rise by as much as 25% on Monday, following the WHO\u2019s PHEIC declaration, and is up some 45% as of Tuesday morning.\n\nBased on synthesized horsepox, TNX-801 is a live virus vaccine that potentially causes fewer toxic side effects than other vaccinia-based shots for monkeypox. Molecular analysis also points to additional viral genes in TNX-801 that could help boost immune protection against monkeypox.\n\nIn June, at the fourth symposium of the Canadian Society for Virology, Tonix touted TNX-801\u2019s promising performance. All eight animal models inoculated with the vaccine candidate were fully protected against an intra-tracheal monkeypox challenge. TNX-801 shots were also well tolerated in animal studies. One week prior, the United States Patent and Trademark Office approved the company\u2019s patent application covering the vaccine candidate.\n\nAside from TNX-801, Tonix has also leveraged its horsepox virus-based vaccine platform against the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach has yielded two candidates for the company, TNX-1840 and TNX-1850, which were designed to induce immune protection against the Omicron variant and its BA.2 subvariant, respectively. Also under Tonix\u2019s belt is TNX-3500 (sangivamycin), an antiviral agent against COVID-19, which the company licensed from OyaGen in April 2021.\n\nDemand Soars for SIGA's Smallpox Drug\n\nAnother beneficiary of the WHO\u2019s PHEIC announcement is SIGA Technologies, whose shares jumped as much as 27% Monday.\n\nThe reason for the industry\u2019s avid interest in the New York-based, commercial-stage company is TPOXX (tecovirimat), SIGA\u2019s small molecule drug against smallpox infection. Meant to be taken orally, TPOXX disrupts the maturation of the variola virus, the agent responsible for smallpox. TPOXX is the first FDA-approved drug for smallpox.\n\nThough specifically indicated for smallpox in adults and children who weigh at least 13 kg, TPOXX\u2019s mechanism of action can also interrupt the viral cycle of other poxviruses such as monkeypox. Last month, SIGA announced that it had received around $13 million in procurement orders for TPOXX. Of this sum, $11 million were from two overseas markets that were buying the drug for the first time as part of their countries\u2019 responses to the monkeypox outbreak.\n\nEarlier in July, the United Kingdom approved TPOXX for the treatment of monkeypox. The US FDA has yet to give the drug its regulatory nod for monkeypox.\n\nTEMBEXA Delivers for Chimerix, Emergent BioSolutions\n\nJoining Tonix and SIGA are Chimerix and Emergent BioSolutions, which entered into an acquisition agreement in May over TEMBEXA (brincidofovir), an FDA-approved antiviral agent against smallpox.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Chimerix is handing over TEMBEXA for $225 million upfront and up to $100 million in milestone payments. The Durham, NC-based company remains eligible for a 20% royalty on gross sales in the U.S. and a 15% royalty on profit overseas.\n\nSince the acquisition was announced, TEMBEXA has raked in money for Chimerix. In June, a third party outside of North America placed a $9.3 million order for the drug. The following day, the Public Health Agency of Canada awarded the company a $25.3-million contract to procure TEMBEXA. Chimerix expects to fulfill both orders as these are set to complete before the closing date of its deal with Emergent.\n\nMonkeypox\u2019s PHEIC designation bumped Chimerix\u2019s shares by as much as 24%, and Emergent\u2019s by as much as 7.4%."

        "Swarm mission discovers interannual waves in Earth\u2019s core",
        "Using information from ESA\u2019s Swarm satellite mission, scientists have discovered a completely new type of magnetic wave that sweeps across the outermost part of Earth\u2019s outer core every seven years and propagates westward at up to 1 500 km (932 miles) a year. The discovery offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth\u2019s core.\n\nSince the trio of Swarm satellites was launched in 2013, scientists have been analyzing their data to gain new insight into many of Earth\u2019s natural processes, from space weather to the physics and dynamics of Earth\u2019s stormy heart.\n\nMeasuring our magnetic field from space is the only real way of probing deep down to Earth\u2019s core. Seismology and mineral physics provide information about the material properties of the core, but they do not shed any light on the dynamo-generating motion of the liquid outer core.\n\nBut now, using data from the Swarm mission, scientists have unearthed a hidden secret.\n\n\u201cGeophysicists have long theorized over the existence of such waves, but they were thought to take place over much longer time scales than our research has shown,\u201d said lead author Nicolas Gillet from the University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes.\n\n\u201cMeasurements of the magnetic field from instruments based on the surface of Earth suggested that there was some kind of wave action, but we needed the global coverage offered by measurements from space to reveal what is actually going on.\n\n\u201cWe combined satellite measurements from Swarm, and also from the earlier German Champ mission and Danish \u00d8rsted mission, with a computer model of the geodynamo to explain what the ground-based data had thrown up \u2013 and this led to our discovery.\u201d\n\nOwing to Earth\u2019s rotation, these waves align in columns along the axis of rotation. The motion and magnetic field changes associated with these waves are strongest near the equatorial region of the core.\n\nWhile the research exhibits magneto-Coriolis waves near a seven-year period, the question of the existence of such waves that would oscillate at different periods, however, remains.\n\n\u201cMagnetic waves are likely to be triggered by disturbances deep within the Earth\u2019s fluid core, possibly related to buoyancy plumes. Each wave is specified by its period and typical length-scale, and the period depends on characteristics of the forces at play. For magneto-Coriolis waves, the period is indicative of the intensity of the magnetic field within the core,\u201d Gillet added.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that other such waves are likely to exist, probably with longer periods \u2013 but their discovery relies on more research.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earth\u2019s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earth\u2019s thermal history,\u201d said Ilias Daras, ESA\u2019s Swarm mission scientist.\n\nReferences:\n\n1 Swarm unveils magnetic waves deep down \u2013 ESA \u2013 May 23, 2022\n\n2 Satellite magnetic data reveal interannual waves in Earth\u2019s core \u2013 Nicolas Gillet et al. \u2013 PNAS \u2013 March 21, 2022 \u2013 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.211525811\n\nFeatured image credit: University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, ESA"

        "Sore Throat Is the Most Common COVID Symptom Right Now",
        "Key Takeaways Data from the ZOE COVID Symptom Study suggests that a sore throat is now the most common symptom reported by people infected with the Omicron subvariant BA.5.\n\nWhile reports of sore throats are on the rise, experts say Omicron BA.5 is not to blame for all of them.\n\nA sore throat is a symptom of COVID, no matter which variant. If you have a sore throat and other COVID symptoms or you\u2019ve possibly been exposed, get tested.\n\nThe ZOE COVID Symptom Study in the United Kingdom has been tracking reports of COVID-19 cases and symptoms for scientific research. A few months ago, the data from the study suggested that the most common symptom of COVID was either a runny nose or a headache.\n\nBased on reports from 17,500 people who tested positive for COVID last week, the most common symptom now is having a sore throat, followed by a headache and nasal congestion, according to a BBC report.\n\nWith the Omicron subvariant BA.5 being one of the dominant COVID strains in the U.K., it\u2019s easy to assume that the spread of the variant is causing the increasing reports of sore throats. However, experts say that is not necessarily the case.\n\nIs BA.5 to Blame for Sore Throats?\n\nPerry N. Halkitis, PhD, MS, MPH, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health, told Verywell that rising reports of sore throats do not really have to do with the BA.5 subvariant. Sore throat and headaches are common symptoms of COVID regardless of the variant, and this was true earlier in the pandemic with the Alpha variant.\n\nDavid Dowdy, MD, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Verywell that the prevalence of sore throat as a COVID symptom might not be caused by BA.5, either.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Omicron and its subvariants are more associated with upper respiratory symptoms compared to Delta and previous variants, but Dowdy is hesitant to attribute the increase in sore throat reports to the spread of BA.5.\n\n\u201cMore likely, this reflects our own immune systems\u2019 adaptation to the virus, as most people have been exposed to the virus multiple times by now,\u201d said Dowdy. \u201cBut I would not read this as a major shift in the type of symptoms people have been experiencing over the past few months.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a Sore Throat? Keep It Cool\n\nWhile it can also be caused by allergies, a cold, or the flu, a sore throat can certainly be a sign that it\u2019s time to take a COVID test\u2014especially if you think you\u2019ve been exposed.\n\nWhether it turns out to be from COVID or another illness, there are some ways to ease a sore throat at home.\n\nAccording to Halkitis, the key to sore throat relief is making sure your throat is lubricated, cool, and refreshed\u2014for example, by drinking electrolyte solutions or having an electrolyte popsicle.\n\nDowdy recommends drinking plenty of fluids and considering over-the-counter (OTC) lozenges or sprays with local anesthetics to help numb the pain.\n\nWhen to Call Your Provider\n\nHalkitis said it\u2019s important to monitor your symptoms and keep an eye on their trajectory. If they\u2019re not getting better\u2014or getting worse\u2014it\u2019s a sign the illness is progressing. At that point, it\u2019s time to call your healthcare provider to make sure you get treatment to prevent complications.\n\nDowdy agreed but added that some people may not want to wait that long. \u201cIf you are older\u201470 or above\u2014or have a compromised immune system, you should have a low threshold for going to see a doctor if you get COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFor everyone else? Dowdy said you \u201cshould treat this as with any other illness. If you are having prolonged fever or chills or ever experience a change in your mental status, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, this would be a reason to seek medical care.\u201d\n\nWhat This Means For You A sore throat can be a symptom of COVID-19, regardless of which variant you have. If you have a sore throat and other COVID symptoms, get tested. If you haven\u2019t already, get vaccinated and make sure you\u2019re up to date on your boosters.\n\nThe information in this article is current as of the date listed, which means newer information may be available when you read this.

        "Long covid symptoms may include hair loss and ejaculation difficulties",
        "A study of 2.4 million health records suggests the World Health Organization's set of 33 long covid symptoms may be too limited\n\nHair loss may be a long covid symptom Adem Demir / Alamy\n\nHair loss, reduced libido and ejaculation difficulties may be unrecognised symptoms of long covid, according to a study of 2.4 million electronic health records.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines long covid as a set of 33 symptoms that usually develop within three months of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the symptoms lasting at least two months with no alternative explanation.\n\nStudies into long covid vary in their definition of the condition, but generally suggest it affects about 5 to 20 per cent of people who have had covid-19. These studies also suggest that long covid encompasses a wider range of symptoms than is officially recognised by the WHO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe explored the effect of covid-19 on 115 symptoms of which we found 62 symptoms to be statistically significantly associated with covid-19 at 12 weeks [or more] after infection,\u201d says Anuradhaa Subramanian at the University of Birmingham in the UK. \u201cSome of these new symptoms, like reduced libido, sexual dysfunction and hair loss, are really new. They had not been attributed to covid-19 in the longer term before.\u201d\n\nSubramanian and her colleagues analysed the health records of 486,149 people in the UK who tested positive for covid-19 between January 2020 and April 2021 \u2013 when the alpha variant was dominant \u2013 but weren\u2019t hospitalised. These primary care records were compared with those of around 1.9 million people who hadn\u2019t tested positive for covid-19.\n\nThe health records of the individuals who had caught covid-19 were matched against the records of people who had never tested positive, with these pairs being matched according to a range of factors, including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, body mass index and any other health conditions, such as high blood pressure.\n\nThe participants who tested positive for covid-19 were more likely to report any of the study\u2019s 62 symptoms for at least 12 weeks post-infection, compared with those who hadn\u2019t tested positive for covid-19. These symptoms included hair loss, reduced libido and ejaculation difficulties.\n\n\u201cIn addition to premature, delayed and retrograde ejaculation [when semen enters the bladder instead of emerging from the penis], our definition includes painful ejaculation, late ejaculation and fear of ejaculation,\u201d says Subramanian.\n\nRead more: Long covid risk with omicron variant may be half what it is with delta\n\nHow exactly covid-19 leads to hair loss is unclear, but this can be triggered by other infections such as seasonal flu and stressful events.\n\n\u201cWhen your body is in a state of stress, it can result in new hair growth, which actually paradoxically, causes your existing hair to fall out,\u201d says co-author Shamil Haroon at the University of Birmingham. \u201cThis is a condition called telogen effluvium. In this [condition] it\u2019s not like a single patch of hair, but rather it\u2019s kind of generalised hair loss, so that is one potential mechanism for covid-related hair loss.\u201d\n\nProblems with ejaculation and decreased libido are common in other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, but how exactly sexual dysfunction may develop after a viral infection isn\u2019t well understood.\n\n\u201cPeople with other chronic illnesses frequently experience sexual dysfunction and we find the same with covid-19, suggesting covid-19 is a chronic illness,\u201d says Haroon. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t looked at other viral infections in the way that we\u2019ve looked at long covid and I think this is what long covid has made us realise, that viral infections are not just acute events.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s analysis also revealed that people with long covid tend to have one of three types of the condition. Most commonly, people experienced a broad range of symptoms, including fatigue, rash and pain, which together affected about 80 per cent of the participants who had had covid-19.\n\nMore than one in 10 (14.2 per cent) mainly had cognitive symptoms, including depression, anxiety, insomnia and brain fog. And 5.8 per cent of the participants mainly had breathing problems, such as coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing.\n\nHaroon says capturing the full breadth of long covid symptoms and understanding its different types can help clinicians to develop better treatment plans for those with the condition.\n\nJournal reference: Nature Medicine, DOI: doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01909-w"

        "Coronavirus may enter the brain by building tiny tunnels from the nose",
        "How the virus behind covid-19 enters the brain was somewhat of a mystery, but new evidence hints it may build tiny tubes from nose cells to brain cells that it can shuttle through\n\nThe coronavirus may build tubes that enable it to travel from nose cells to the brain Anna Pepe, Pasteur Institute\n\nWe may finally know how covid-19 enters the brain: new research suggests the virus responsible stimulates the growth of tiny tubes between nose and brain cells that it can tunnel through.\n\nCovid-19 has been linked with a range of neurological symptoms including brain fog and confusion. Autopsy studies have also detected the coronavirus in people\u2019s brains. But how it gets there has been somewhat of a mystery. Previous studies suggest the ACE2 receptor that the virus normally uses to get into cells is barely detectable in the brain, unlike the cells lining the nose, mouth and lungs.\n\nNow, Chiara Zurzolo at the Pasteur Institute in France and her colleagues have discovered that the coronavirus seems to have a sneaky way of getting into cells that lack the ACE2 receptor via cells that do have it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey conducted experiments in a dish with the coronavirus and two different cell types. One called SH-SY5Y was used to model human brain cells. The other cell type, Vero E6, was used to model cells that line body surfaces, including the nose.\n\nOn their own, the model brain cells couldn\u2019t be infected with the coronavirus because they lacked the ACE2 receptor. But when they were incubated in the same dish as the model nose cells, which did have these receptors, they became infected.\n\nUnder a particularly powerful electron microscope, the researchers saw that upon entering the model nose cells, the virus stimulated the cells to grow tiny tubes called tunnelling nanotubes that formed connections with the model brain cells.\n\nZooming up close, they saw the virus using these tunnels to shuttle between the two cell types. Nanotubes are already known to transport certain structures and other viral particles between distant cells.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very interesting study because it provides a nice, neat mechanism by which the virus can be transferred from one cell to another while bypassing the need for ACE2 receptors,\u201d says Frederic Meunier at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n\nHowever, because the experiments were limited to cells in a dish, further studies are needed to confirm the same mechanism occurs inside the brain, says Meunier.\n\nZurzolo says her group is setting up \u201corgan-on-a-chip\u201d experiments that more closely mimic the interactions between cells in the nose and brain.\n\nIf tunnelling nanotubes are confirmed to transport the coronavirus from the nose to the brain, we may be able to develop drugs to block them, says Zurzolo. \u201cAt the moment, we do not have a specific tunnelling nanotube-blocking molecule, but we are carrying out screening to find some,\u201d she says.\n\nJournal reference: Science Advances, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abo0171"

        "New York resident infected with polio, marking 1st US case in a decade",
        "After nearly a decade with no reported polio cases in the U.S., a resident of Rockland County, New York has tested positive for the viral disease, state and county health officials announced (opens in new tab) Thursday (July 21).\n\nThe infected individual caught a strain of poliovirus known as \"revertant polio Sabin type 2 virus,\" tests performed by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) revealed. Unlike wild polioviruses, this type of virus derives from the live oral polio vaccine, which has not been administered in the U.S. since 2000.\n\nThe U.S. and many other countries discontinued use of the oral vaccine because the shot contains live, but weakened, polioviruses that can be shed in the stool of vaccinated people, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (opens in new tab) (GPEI). In rare instances, these weakened viruses have evolved to behave more like wild, naturally-occurring polioviruses that can cause illness in people who aren't fully vaccinated. Due to this risk, the U.S. now only administers \"inactivated\" polio vaccines, and for polio to be fully eradicated, all countries will eventually need to halt their use of the oral vaccines.\n\nBecause the New York resident tested positive for a vaccine-derived poliovirus, this suggests that \"the virus may have originated in a location outside of the U.S. where [oral polio vaccine] is administered, since revertant strains cannot emerge from inactivated vaccines,\" the health department statement notes. The last polio case reported in the U.S. occurred in 2013 and was also caused by a vaccine-derived strain.\n\nRelated: Poliovirus detected in London sewage, UK officials warn\n\n\"Based on what we know about this case, and polio in general, the Department of Health strongly recommends that unvaccinated individuals get vaccinated or boosted with the FDA-approved IPV polio vaccine as soon as possible,\" State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in the statement.\n\n\"The polio vaccine is safe and effective, protecting against this potentially debilitating disease, and it has been part of the backbone of required, routine childhood immunizations recommended by health officials and public health agencies nationwide,\" Bassett said.\n\nThe polio vaccine is part of the required school immunization schedule for all U.S. children, so many people are protected from a young age.

        "What is Paris syndrome?",
        "Paris, the capital of France, is awash with history; it's home to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre , the world's most-visited museum (opens in new tab).\n\nYet, despite the city's wealth of cultural hotspots, architectural delights and superb restaurants (it currently has over 90 Michelin one-star (opens in new tab) eateries) some tourists find themselves unable to enjoy a trip to Paris. A small percentage of those who venture to The City of Light experience \"Paris syndrome,\" a psychological condition with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate.\n\nBut what, exactly, is Paris syndrome? Who tends to be affected by it, and why?\n\nThough not indexed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Paris syndrome is recognized by many experts as a real, though rare, phenomenon. According to Mathieu Deflem, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina, Paris syndrome is \"most common among Japanese\" tourists. Why, then, are Japanese people so susceptible?\n\n\"We are talking about a culture that, historically, had a completely different belief system and development trajectory from places in Europe,\" Rodanthi Tzanelli, a professor of cultural sociology at the University of Leeds in the U.K., told Live Science. These cultural differences, as well as likely unmet romantic expectations, may explain why Japanese visitors are at an elevated risk for Paris syndrome.\n\nRelated: Did Marie Antoinette really say 'Let them eat cake'?\n\nNausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate are all symptoms of Paris syndrome. (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nParis syndrome should be regarded as an extreme form of culture shock, Deflem said. Culture shock can, in particularly severe cases, result in people feeling disorientated, depressed, irritable and physically ill, according to the University of the Pacific in California (opens in new tab).\n\n\n\n\"Culture shock is an illness resulting from the loss of meaning brought about when people from one symbolic reality find themselves immersed in another,\" Rachel Irwin, now a cultural sciences researcher at Lund University in Sweden, wrote in a 2007 article (opens in new tab). In other words, people can become bewildered \u2014 sometimes to a significant degree \u2014 when surrounded by symbols (logos, names, signs, brands) that are different from those they would usually encounter.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms associated with culture shock are similar to those experienced by someone who is feeling anxious. According to Calm Clinic (opens in new tab), a mental health resource website, when someone is experiencing anxiety, signals will be sent to the stomach that are \"related to the fight or flight response.\" As a result, the \"signals alter the way that the stomach and gut process and digest food, causing nausea.\" In particularly extreme cases of anxiety \u2014 as with culture shock \u2014 this nausea can lead to vomiting, disorientation and a host of other physical reactions.\n\n\n\nWhile everybody experiences culture shock \"in one form or another when visiting somewhere new,\" some people feel it in more pronounced and visceral ways when presented with a culture that is \"unexpected or nuanced,\" according to Deflem.\n\nWith regard to Paris syndrome specifically, \"a number of factors are at work,\" Deflem told Live Science. \"It will be a combination of expectations from Japanese culture and the reality of Paris.\"\n\nDeflem noted that, generally speaking, Japanese culture has a somewhat romanticized view of the West, \"especially Europe.\" This, Deflem suggests, is largely down to how Paris is represented in films \u2014 such as \"Am\u00e9lie\" (Miramax Films, 2001), \"Before Sunset\" (Warner Independent Pictures, 2004) and \"An American in Paris\" (Loew's Inc., 1954) \u2014 and books \u2014 \"A Night at the Majestic\" (Faber and Faber, 2006), \"The Ladies' Delight\" (1883) and \"A Moveable Feast\" (Scribner Classic, 1964) \u2014 which tend to focus on art, coffee culture, quaint restaurants and cordial, intelligent conversation. He suggested that these expectations are \"not realistic, especially in Paris, which is not known for being hospitable.\"\n\nIndeed, a 2014 study carried out by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler (opens in new tab) named Paris the world's fourth most unfriendly city; a 2020 study by CEOWORLD magazine (opens in new tab) awarded Paris the title of rudest city in Europe; and a 2021 survey by InterNations (opens in new tab), an organization dedicated to helping people relocate, concluded that Paris is Europe's third-least-friendly city for expats.\n\nRelated: How did bachelor and bachelorette parties get started?\n\nReality hits hard when visitors to Paris are forced to take off the rose-tinted glasses of which they've been viewing the city of romance. (Image credit: by-studio via Getty Images)\n\nIn popular culture, \"Paris is presented in ways that do not reflect the realities of the city, especially not in recent times, when much of Paris is no longer the France of old,\" Deflem said.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Deflem highlighted that \"Japan, for example, has a very orderly and polite culture,\" while Parisian everyday life is less so \"despite its image,\" he said. \"Parisians can sometimes be guilty of looking down on people \u2014 even non-Parisian French \u2014 which is seldom seen in Japanese culture. The confrontation is sharp.\"\n\nAccording to Deflem, \"very subtle differences\" regarding cultural norms or societal expectations can cause confusion because \"it makes situations tricky to navigate.\" Such misunderstandings can be difficult for tourists because it is hard to know when a \"particular value is at play, when to apologize, when not to ask a question etc. Culture is complex.\"\n\nBut could visitors to other cities experience similar feelings? Might someone exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with Paris syndrome in other historic cities, such as Vienna, New York or Beijing?\n\nTzanelli thinks Paris syndrome may not be specific to the French capital. Rather, she regards it as \"a very complex psychic phenomenon that has to do with disappointment, even despair, about the ways reality does not match our romantic expectations.\"\n\nThe syndrome is likely a \"generational phenomenon,\" because younger generations tend to be \"more globetrotting,\" and therefore are likely to be more prepared for what they will experience at a destination, she added.\n\nHowever, Tzanelli is keen to point out that nobody is immune to culture shock, regardless of their age or the amount they have traveled.\n\n\"We are creatures of habit,\" she said. \"We are inculcated into a particular way of life, adopt behaviors and habits from our surroundings, and become part of a culture and social group. We never think about these things, but habits, behaviors and values always work at the back of who we are and what we do. When we are suddenly taken out of this system of beliefs and habits, out of the ways we structure our life, we are left with no means to frame and define who we are.\"\n\nTzanelli noted that, although she's well acquainted with culture shock and has studied it in detail, she is by no means immune to its effects.\n\n\"I've had this experience [of culture shock] even in places I had previously visited,\" she said. \"Time affects memory, and the stored images we have of places are bound to differ from reality.\"\n\nOriginally published on Live Science."

        "Are We Getting Closer to a Potential Universal Coronavirus Monoclonal Therapeutic?",
        "A research team reports discovering a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that it says has the potential to become a universal coronavirus therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and all its variants of concern, including Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron.\n\nIn multiple animal models, the mAb shows effectiveness against the SARS-CoV, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that emerged in China in 2002, and MERS-CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the scientists, who had that it also shows effectiveness against several common cold coronaviruses.\n\nThe mAb targets the S2 stalk region of the viral spike (S) protein that is highly conserved among beta-coronaviruses yet is also essential for the virus to attach and enter cells, leading to infection. The mAb protected against infections when given as an intraperitoneal injection or a nasal dose.\n\nThe study \u201cPotent universal beta-coronavirus therapeutic activity mediated by direct respiratory administration of a Spike S2 domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibody\u201d appears in PLOS Pathogens.\n\n\u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third novel \u03b2-coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades. Although vaccines are available, too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape. To determine if antibodies could be identified with universal coronavirus activity, plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved between human \u03b2-coronavirus,\u201d write the investigators.\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies developed\n\n\u201cFrom these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad hmAb, able to recognize all human \u03b2-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of 1249A8 i.n. dose 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV Urbani strain, protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.\u201d\n\nThe mAb, and mAb discovered earlier by the researchers, are being developed as a therapeutic cocktail for COVID-19 under license to Aridis Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2 marks the third time in the last two decades a beta-coronavirus has caused significant mortality in humans,\u201d says James J. Kobie, PhD, co-senior study author from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 has caused the most infections and deaths worldwide. New variants pose the risk of evading the immune system, even in vaccinated and previously infected individuals, and there remains the potential for other genetically distinct coronaviruses to emerge as new pandemic strains in the future.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, finding new therapeutic and prophylactic drugs and vaccine strategies that have universal activity against the coronavirus is essential for protecting humanity against the current and future beta-coronavirus outbreaks or pandemics.\u201d\n\nVaccines and other monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the receptor-binding domain, or the RBD, located at the heads of the S viral protein spike that projects from the surface of the virus. Each virus has 24 to 40 spikes. The RBD is good at eliciting an immune response, but that portion of the S permits many mutations that can let the virus escape antibodies.\n\nOne key in the present research was finding an antibody target on a part of the spike called the S2, or the stalk region. This region is highly conserved and only rarely mutates because that would disrupt its essential function. After the RBD at the head of the S attaches the coronavirus to a receptor molecule on the surface of a target cell, the S2 stalk acts to bring the virus inside the target cell. There the virus replicates, killing the cell, and releasing a hoard of new, infectious virions.\n\nAridis is using the two hmAbs in its AR-701 cocktail designed for inhaled delivery. AR-701 is engineered for long-acting effectiveness, potentially lasting a year or more when used in humans, according to the company.\n\nAlso involved in the study are researchers from the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Colorado State University."

        "COVID-19 Treatment Hope Found in Anti-Inflammatory Drug",
        "The findings of a recent Phase IIa clinical trial suggest that OP-101, a hydroxyl-polyamidoamine dendrimer\u2013N-acetyl cysteine conjugate, may have potential for treating systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.\n\nA single intravenous infusion of the anti-inflammatory compound was well tolerated and reduced the risk of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 and 60 days after treatment when compared to placebo. OP-101 treatment, which targets activated macrophages, was associated with decreased serum concentrations of proinflammatory markers as well as markers of neurological injury (neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein). The drug may have the potential to treat systemic inflammation and brain injury in patients with severe COVID-19 and significantly reduce their chances of death.\n\nThe results of the trial were published in Science Translational Medicine in the article, \u201cDendrimer nanotherapy for severe COVID-19 attenuates inflammation and neurological injury markers and improves outcomes in a Phase IIa clinical trial.\u201d\n\nIn the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive Phase IIa trial, 24 patients classified as having severe COVID-19 across five clinical sites in the United States were randomized to receive a single intravenous dose of placebo (n = 7 patients) or OP-101 at 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6), or 8 mg/kg (n = 5 patients). All patients received standard of care, including corticosteroids.\n\n\u201cOP-101 is a novel nanotherapeutic compound that specifically targets activated macrophages and microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain,\u201d said Aaron M. Gusdon, MD, assistant professor in the Vivian L. Smith department of neurosurgery with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. \u201cDue to its excellent safety profile, we were excited to offer this therapy to these critically ill patients at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\u201d\n\nHyperinflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity in COVID-19. OP-101 was found to be better than a placebo at decreasing inflammatory markers, as well as better at reducing markers of neurological injury, including neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein.\n\nAdditionally, risk for the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 or 60 days after treatment was 71% for patients receiving the placebo, but just 18% for patients in the pooled OP-101 treatment arms. At 60 days after treatment, 3 of 7 patients given placebo and 14 of 17 patients treated with OP-101 survived.\n\nThe data shows that OP-101 was well tolerated in the critically ill patient population and could serve as an effective treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAlthough this was a small-dose escalation trial, there was clearly a strong signal toward benefit at both acute and chronic timepoint,\u201d Gusdon said. \u201cThe possibility that this therapy could also benefit patients with other diseases that lead to systemic inflammatory responses, including various forms of brain injury, is extremely exciting.\u201d"

        "State-level reports are the best publicly available and timely data on child COVID-19 cases in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association are collaborating to collect and share all publicly available data from states on child COVID-19 cases. The definition of \u201cchild\u201d case is based on varying age ranges reported across states (see report Appendix for details and links to all data sources).\n\nReported COVID-19 cases among children spiked dramatically in 2022 during the Omicron variant winter surge, peaking at 1,150,000 cases reported in one week. For the week ending July 21st, nearly 92,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, the second consecutive weekly increase of reported cases, with around 68,000 cases reported the week ending July 7th. Reported new child cases have decreased substantially since the Omicron peak, at the same time, child cases are far higher than one year ago, July 22, 2021, when 39,000 child cases were reported.\n\nOver 14 million children are reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports; over 311,000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks. Approximately 6.1 million reported cases have been added in 2022.\n\nThe age distribution of reported COVID-19 cases was provided on the health department websites of reporting states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Since the pandemic began, children represented 18.6% of total cumulated cases.\n\nSince early June, there has been a notable decline in the portion of reported weekly COVID-19 cases that are children. For the week ending July 21st, this portion was 12.7% (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). While COVID-19 cases are likely increasingly under-reported for all age groups, this decline indicates that children are disproportionately undercounted in reported COVID-19 cases.\n\nThere is an urgent need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children\u2019s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth.\n\n\n\n"

        "Summary: Sexual dysfunction and hair loss are being reported as additional symptoms long-COVID patients experience, a new study reports.\n\nSource: University of Birmingham\n\nLong Covid sufferers have experienced a wider set of symptoms than previously thought including hair loss and sexual dysfunction, new research has found.\n\nA study published in Nature Medicine today found that patients with a primary care record of infection with the virus that causes Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) reported 62 symptoms much more frequently 12 weeks after initial infection than those who hadn\u2019t contracted the virus.\n\nAnonymised electronic health records of 2.4 million people in the UK were analysed by researchers from the University of Birmingham alongside a team of clinicians and researchers across England, and was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research and UK Research and Innovation.\n\nThe data taken between January 2020 and April 2021 comprised of 486,149 people with prior infection, and 1.9 million people with no indication of coronavirus infection after matching for other clinical diagnoses.\n\nUsing only non-hospitalised patients, the team of researchers were able to identify three categories of distinct symptoms reported by people with persistent health problems after infection.\n\nPatterns of symptoms tended to be grouped into respiratory symptoms, mental health and cognitive problems, and then a broader range of symptoms. While the most common symptoms include anosmia (loss of sense of smell), shortness of breath, chest pain and fever; others include:\n\namnesia,\n\napraxia (inability to perform familiar movements or commands),\n\nbowel incontinence,\n\nerectile dysfunction,\n\nhallucinations,\n\nlimb swelling\n\nDr Shamil Haroon, Associate Clinical Professor in Public Health at the University of Birmingham is the senior author on the study. Dr Haroon said:\n\n\u201cThis research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of Long Covid are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe symptoms we identified should help clinicians and clinical guideline developers to improve the assessment of patients with long-term effects from Covid-19, and to subsequently consider how this symptom burden can be best managed.\u201d\n\nPatient partner and co-author of this study Jennifer Camaradou said:\n\n\u201cThis study is instrumental in creating and adding further value to understanding the complexity and pathology of long COVID. It highlights the degree and diversity of expression of symptoms between different clusters. Patients with pre-existing health conditions will also welcome the additional analysis on risk factors.\u201d\n\nSeveral other patient partners involved in the therapies for long COVID (TLC) study have expressed their views on living with long COVID, accessible at:\n\nhttps://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/applied-health/research/long-covid/index.aspx?pageindex=0\n\nAs well as identifying a wider set of symptoms, the research team also found key demographic groups and behaviours which put people at increased risk of developing Long Covid.\n\nThe study suggests that females, younger people; or belonging to a black, mixed or other ethnic group are at greater risk of developing Long Covid. In addition, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, smokers, people who are overweight or obese, as well as the presence of a wide range of health conditions were associated with reporting persistent symptoms.\n\nAnuradhaa Subramanian, Research Fellow at the Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham and lead author of the paper said:\n\n\u201cOur data analyses of risk factors are of particular interest because it helps us to consider what could potentially be causing or contributing to Long Covid. We already know that certain modifiable traits such as smoking and obesity put people at increased risk of various diseases and conditions, including Long Covid. However, others such as biological sex and ethnicity also appear to be important.\n\nPatterns of symptoms tended to be grouped into respiratory symptoms, mental health and cognitive problems, and then a broader range of symptoms. Image is in the public domain\n\n\u201cWomen are for example more likely to experience autoimmune diseases. Seeing the increased likelihood of women having Long Covid in our study increases our interest in investigating whether autoimmunity or other causes may explain the increased risk in women.\n\n\u201cThese observations will help to further narrow the focus on factors to investigate that may be causing these persistent symptoms after an infection, and how we can help patients who are experiencing them.\u201d\n\nPatient records for 2.3m people enabled the research team to capture post SARS-CoV-2 infections at a unique point in the global pandemic. The study focuses on the first phase of the pandemic in the UK between January 2020 and April 2021 and provided the team with an opportunity to compare meaningful numbers of people who had coronavirus infections alongside a control group of uninfected people.\n\nThe interdisciplinary team involved epidemiologists, clinicians, data scientists, statisticians, and patients to decode electronic health records to accurately capture persistent symptoms experienced after infection.\n\nDr Shamil Haroon said:\n\n\u201cThe results are both a testament to the opportunities that these public health datasets provide, and to the power of collaborative work to provide much needed evidence around the experiences of many people who have been affected by persistent symptoms after infection with the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI hope our research will also further validate the voices of patients and involvement groups and provide an approach to support healthcare responses to new and emerging diseases.\u201d\n\nAbout this Long-COVID research news\n\nAuthor: Tim Mayo\n\nSource: University of Birmingham\n\nContact: Tim Mayo \u2013 University of Birmingham\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cSymptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults\u201d by Shamil Haroon et al. Nature Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\nSymptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a range of persistent symptoms impacting everyday functioning, known as post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID.\n\nWe undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms.\n\nWe selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition.\n\nCox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks.\n\nThe largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02\u20138.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63\u20134.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40\u20135.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61\u20134.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61\u20133.47). Among the cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities.\n\nThe risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a plethora of symptoms that are associated with a range of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors."

We only had one variant of SARS-CoV-2, the wildtype, and we had no idea what the COVID-19 pandemic had in store for us.\n\nAn emerging subvariant of Omicron, BA.2.7, nicknamed \u201cCentaurus\u201d on social media, is causing both concern and confusion among people worldwide. Why the astronomical nickname, what do we know about it, and is there really cause for worry? Here is what the data and experts have to say.\n\n\u201cI agree with the WHO\u2019s current approach of not assigning any new [variants of concern] to the Omicron subvariants so far. The appearance of Omicron was a very significant event in the evolution of the virus and the pandemic\u2019s progression and more such significant \u2018jumps\u2019 are expected in the future. As such, if we were to name every Omicron subvariant with a new Greek letter we\u2019d be undermining the importance of \u2018Omicron\u2019 as a group of subvariants.\u201d\n\nExperts first detected this variant in India in May, where it was reportedly spreading more rapidly than other Omicron subvariants.\n\nThe WHO has not yet designated BA.2.75 as a variant of concern in its own right, though it is currently monitoring it. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) designated it a \u201cvariant under monitoring\u201d on July 7, 2022 as it has been detected in European countries including the U.K. and Germany.\n\nMany people and headlines are now referring to the Centaurus variant in much the same way as they referred to the Delta and Beta variants, as though it were its official name.\n\nOne of those, named BA.2.75 in the Pangeo lineage system used by virologists and the WHO, has been nicknamed Centaurus on the back of a single Tweet , which caught on unexpectedly well.\n\nThe current dominant variant in countries around the world is the Omicron variant. However, a number of subvariants have been detected within the Omicron lineage in recent months.\n\nThe so-called Centaurus variant is not the first Omicron subvariant to be detected, nor is it the only subvariant being monitored at the moment.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 and others are also Omicron subvariants that are closely monitored by public health organizations, and a study in Nature, published as an unedited manuscript, showed that they could both escape the immunity conferred from infection with the original Omicron variant, or any vaccines that might be based on it.\n\nThis emerging subvariant is so new that just 400 genomic sequences of it have been made available so far, explained Dr. Ulrich Elling, research group leader at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Vienna, Austria, where he supports genomic surveillance of COVID-19.\n\nAlready experts have determined that BA.2.75 has nine mutations, eight of them new in the area of the genome coding for the spike protein, on top of the 29 BA.2 mutations already present in the variant it evolved from. As \u201cimmune evasion is the prime selective force now we should expect BA.2.75 to affect primarily immune evasion,\u201d said Dr. Elling.\n\nVery little has yet been published on the variant, though one team in Beijing has investigated what the individual effects of each of the mutations could be and shared a preprint of some of their results.\n\nDr. Elling said: \u201cWhat the data indicate is that BA.2.75 is particularly suited to overcome the immune protection generated by Delta while it is similar to other Omicron lineages after vaccination. However, it must be said that the data are very preliminary and based on few patients, as well as generated with pseudovirus as opposed to real BA.2.75 isolates, so we really must await further results.\u201d\n\nThese data suggest that BA.2.75 has a higher affinity for ACE2 receptors, the receptor found in many human tissues to which the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to gain entry to human cells and replicate.\n\nOne other study whose findings were shared as a preprint by a team in Japan, generated pseudoviruses harboring the spike proteins of BA.2.75, BA.4, BA.5 and BA.2, and exposed them to monoclonal antibodies that are used as a treatment for people with COVID-19, but which would be less effective if the variant was able to escape the antibodies present in it.\n\nLytras noted about this that \u201c[s]ome preliminary lab results do suggest that BA.2.75 has a slightly different immune escape phenotype to BA.4 and BA.5, but I do not think that there\u2019s enough experimental or epidemiological evidence yet to support that BA.2.75 is \u2014 or will be \u2014 a cause for concern.\u201d\n\nThe current level of testing is also too low to be able to tell if the BA.2.75 variant would become the dominant variant in the next wave, said Dr. Elling.\n\n\u201cAnyway, the big open question is if we will remain in the Omicron clade this winter or if an old variant makes a revival. Delta is still detected for example and as we know virus remains hidden in immune suppressed patients for more than a year before it resurfaces as a new variant. A year ago there was Delta all over, no Omicron,\u201d he pointed out."

        "Novavax COVID-19 vaccine: When will it be available in the US?",
        "Share on Pinterest Pictured, workers in a Novavax laboratory on May 25, 2022, in Gaithersburg, MD. Image credit: Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images. Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nResearch shows Novavax to be 100% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19.\n\nNovavax uses a traditional vaccine model used previously for influenza and shingles vaccines.\n\nThe United States Department of Health and Human Services has secured 3.2 million doses of Novavax for distribution in the U.S., with ordering opening to medical professionals in the coming weeks. On July 13, 2022, the FDA announced it had granted emergency use authorization for Novavax \u2014 a new vaccine for COVID-19. Novavax marks the fourth COVID-19 vaccine available in the U.S. The other available vaccines are Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nWhat is Novavax? Novavax, Inc. manufactures the Novavax vaccine , NVX-CoV2373. A clinician administers the vaccine in a two-dose regimen in the upper arm, with doses spaced between 3 to 8 weeks apart. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now also recommend the vaccine for adults 18 years and older. According to a spokesperson for Novavax, the manufacturer has submitted adolescent clinical data to the FDA and expects a rapid review of its adolescent filing. Additionally, the spokesperson said Novavax intends to file for authorization for boosting in the U.S. for Novavax COVID-19 vaccine shortly.\n\nHow is this vaccine different? Some of the previous COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 namely Pfizer and Moderna \u2014 utilize mRNA technology. Instead of using weakened or dead viral cells to teach your body how to protect itself from the live disease, mRNA vaccines provide instructions to the body on how to create a spike protein . Spike proteins are also found in SARS-CoV-2 virus cells. The body recognizes the spike protein as something foreign it needs to defend itself from, causing an immune response . This teaches the body how to react if ever infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the same spike proteins. The Novavax vaccine does not use mRNA technology. Instead, it is a protein-based vaccine that contains stabilized forms of the spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, plus an adjuvant \u2014 a substance included in a vaccine to cause the body to have an immune response. Novavax uses an adjuvant made from saponins that naturally occur in the bark of the Soapbark tree native to Chile. \u201cNovavax is built on a well-understood protein technology used for many years in other vaccines to protect against diseases such as influenza, shingles, and HPV,\u201d a representative from Novavax explained for Medical News Today. \u201cThe protein is derived from the coronavirus spike protein and is formulated with Novavax\u2019s patented saponin-based Matrix-M\u2122 adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and can neither replicate nor can it cause COVID-19,\u201d they added. Dr. Fady Youssef, a board-certified pulmonologist, internist, and critical care specialist at MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, said many clinicians have been waiting for the Novavax vaccine to become available because it uses a traditional-based vaccine-making model. \u201cMy hope is a lot of patients that have had hesitancy about the mRNA vaccines, because they\u2019re using novel and new technology, will be less reluctant to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using a traditional vaccine like Novavax,\u201d he told MNT. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how it compares to the mRNA vaccines in terms of efficacy, as well as breakthrough infections and how long the protection that it provides lasts,\u201d Dr. Youssef continued. \u201cSo that will be interesting to see over the next few months [and] years.\u201d\n\nHow effective is Novavax? The phase 3 PREVENT-19 clinical trial conducted between December 2020 and February 2021 included almost 30,000 adults from the U.S. and Mexico. Participants received either two doses of Novavax or two doses of a saline placebo. According to the results of the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found Novavax to be 90.4% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. They also reported the vaccine as 100% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19."

        "Long COVID: Cardiovascular implications and POTS",
        "Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 According to Dr. Fedorowski, \u201csomewhere between 1% and 10% of individuals [who contracted SARS-CoV-2] will develop all these [cardiovascular] complications, [such as] myocarditis, pericarditis, and even blood clots building in [the] arteries.\u201d The difficulty in treating these cases, moreover, is [because] the cardiovascular impact can be difficult to pinpoint at first. \u201cWe are talking about very small blood clots in very small arteries \u2014 they are not so easy to detect,\u201d said Dr. Fedorowski. \u201cBut some patients may report having blue fingers out of nowhere, just being infected a few days before. And this might be a sign of a very small, tiny blood clot in [the] peripheral blood arteries.\u201d The Nature Medicine study that we referred to earlier in the article shows that there is an increased risk of a whole range of cardiovascular outcomes even in those not admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 \u2014 that is, even in milder cases of the disease. To reach this conclusion, the study authors analyzed data from a large cohort of \u201c153,760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5,637,647 (contemporary controls) and 5,859,411 (historical controls) individuals.\u201d This ongoing risk of cardiovascular issues does not apply only to adults. According to a paper in Circulation in November 2020, children can also experience acute heart failure weeks after having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is likely to be an effect of long COVID in children, which is also under investigation. However, the syndrome that has most puzzled scientists regarding its association with long COVID is POTS.\n\nWhat is POTS, really? The medical community generally describes POTS, the syndrome that affects more and more people with long COVID, as a dysautonomic phenomenon \u2014 that is, something that affects the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the body\u2019s \u201cautopilot mode,\u201d which controls key bodily functions, such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion. POTS is one of several forms of dysautonomia, alongside neurocardiogenic syncope, which involves frequent fainting spells and multiple system atrophy, a rare and fatal condition that leads to rapid systemic deterioration. The symptoms of POTS are as numerous as they are varied, ranging from lightheadedness upon standing up from a seated position to tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate), shortness of breath, and digestive symptoms. This heterogeneity of symptoms can make POTS difficult to diagnose. Doctors often mistake it for an anxiety disorder , as symptoms such as a rapid heart rate and heart palpitations also occur in people who experience anxiety. \u201cThe problem with POTS is that it seems to be not only a cardiovascular problem \u2014 [a] heart and vessel problem \u2014 [but also] a problem of your nervous system, sometimes on your gastrointestinal system,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski explained. \u201cAnd in the end, we call it \u2018dysautonomia,\u2019 as it seems [to be] about your autonomic nervous system, which controls all your autonomic functions [\u2026]. And as the autonomic nervous system controls, first of all, your circulatory system, the main symptoms that you feel are from the circulatory or from your heart palpitations or blood pressure instability \u2014 you don\u2019t feel good when you stand up, and so on. But the problems are a little bit diffused,\u201d he noted, pointing out that even top specialists may find it hard to diagnose POTS correctly. Ms. Meriquez V\u00e1zquez described her experience of POTS as a life altering syndrome, and she confirmed the similarity between symptoms of POTS and those of a panic attack: \u201c[M]y POTS started as very severe adrenaline rushes along with a racing heart, especially when I was standing \u2014 I would get so nauseated and dizzy. From all of the adrenaline, it felt like a panic attack, but it would come out of nowhere.\u201d Why does adrenaline, or epinephrine, play a role? Dr. Kavi explained that \u201cthe sympathetic nervous system is the fight-or-flight system, and that\u2019s where the adrenaline [\u2026] \u2014 noradrenaline \u2014 comes in.\u201d \u201cThe parasympathetic system is the rest-and-digest system. And for us to function normally, we have to have a balance between the two \u2014 a sort of equilibrium. And it\u2019s when that equilibrium gets disrupted, and one or [the other] is overpowering that people develop problems,\u201d she explained.\n\nWhat causes POTS? The mechanisms behind POTS remain unclear, but ongoing research is searching for the likeliest explanations. A study published in February 2022 in Cells found that people with POTS have platelet storage pool deficiency, a phenomenon linked to symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds, dysmenorrhea, easy bruising, and anemia. It also showed that people with POTS have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, all of which may suggest a state of chronic inflammation. \u201c[T]he data provided [in this study] suggest that POTS is a mixed inflammatory pattern disease,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nPOTS before and after COVID-19 Although more and more media content has started looking at POTS as a long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections, POTS itself is not a newly emerged syndrome. According to data that the nonprofit organization Dysautonomia International cited well before the pandemic, an estimated 1\u20133 million people in the U.S. had POTS. Although it is unclear how many more people are seeking care in the aftermath of COVID-19 than they were pre-pandemic, anecdotal reports seem to indicate a steep increase in cases, most of them associated with long COVID. Dr. Fedorowski also told us that he and his colleagues at the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden have been seeing an influx of people with long COVID whom doctors have referred for POTS treatment: \u201cWe experience a huge inflow of new referrals from different parts of the region of Stockholm, meaning that in the Stockholm area, [where] we have around 2.5 million citizens, [\u2026] from [that] whole area, we are getting referrals from primary care doctors [and] from other specialists from other hospitals regarding people who developed what we call \u2018long COVID\u2019 or \u2018post-COVID syndrome.\u2019 The main reason they are sent to us is that [here] is quite [a] high clinical suspicion of POTS \u2014 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.\u201d According to Dr. Fedorowski, at almost 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of referrals for POTS rehabilitation \u201chas doubled or tripled.\u201d Dr. Chung made a similar observation about the Johns Hopkins POTS Program, saying that he and his colleagues \u201chave [had] at least twice or three times more referrals\u201d at their clinic since the start of the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic numbers. And Dr. Kavi told us that the situation is the same in the U.K.: \u201cHere, the feedback that I\u2019m getting from the clinicians that we work with \u2014 who run POTS services and secondary care [\u2026] \u2014 [is] that they\u2019re noticing a significant increase in their referrals. And, of course, that means that their waiting lists are getting longer as well.\u201d\n\nWho is at risk of POTS, and why? Current data indicate that the people who most commonly receive a diagnosis of POTS in long COVID are young females. However, both Dr. Fedorowski and Dr. Chung noted that there is a slight difference in the demographics of people presenting with POTS before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have POTS associated with long COVID. According to the researchers, pre-pandemic, most people with POTS tended to be in their teens or early 20s, while people with long-COVID-associated POTS tend to be in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Dr. Fedorowski speculated that the high levels of stress that women in these demographics often encounter, perhaps due to persistent issues of gender inequality in the home and workplace, may play a role. \u201cA lot of younger women [\u2026] get affected by POTS as a consequence of COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski told Medical News Today. \u201cAnd if you talk to them [\u2026], then you will see a picture of a woman who is working very hard, having [a] family, taking care of children, and trying to reach some higher position in [\u2026] society; or [there] are the women who are very much stressed by feeling that they are not good enough.\u201d During the pandemic, for instance, women have continued to bear the higher burden of child care and stay-at-home orders during the early stages have also disproportionately affected working women. Research has shown that chronic stress can have a very real physiological impact, leading to impaired immune system function and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. However, reflecting on the shift in POTS demographics outlined by Drs Chung and Fedorowski, Dr. Kavi wondered whether \u201cit\u2019s a real increase in older people having POTS [after COVID-19] or whether it\u2019s just not being picked up in younger people\u201d since POTS is often not given due consideration as a possible diagnosis. \u201cIn terms of pediatricians and [family doctors], for example, they often don\u2019t think about [POTS as a possible diagnosis], and then there\u2019s very little, almost nothing in the way of services for people in the U.K. with POTS that are under the age of 16, so I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s there and we\u2019re missing it or it\u2019s not [been] there [previously].\u201d \u2013 Dr. Lesley Kavi Ms V\u00e0zquez also wondered whether more people with long COVID are now receiving POTS diagnoses not because they have newly developed the syndrome after becoming ill with COVID-19, but because their existing POTS symptoms have worsened in the aftermath. In their online support group, she told us, people are \u201coften reflecting on how they may have had signs of autonomic dysfunction prior to getting sick [with COVID-19].\u201d Research on POTS conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic further indicates that the syndrome can be associated with various chronic conditions, including diabetes, sarcoidosis, and lupus, as well as with aggressive treatments, such as chemotherapy. There is also some suggestion that POTS can develop following a viral illness and that sometimes genetic factors may be at play. According to PoTS UK, the syndrome can have associations with inherited conditions, such as hypermobility spectrum disorder and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. POTS also has associations with mast cell activation disorder , which causes allergic symptoms."

        "Share on Pinterest African fruit bats are the main carriers of Marburg virus disease. Richard Packwood/Getty Images The West African country of Ghana recently announced its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD).\n\nMVD, caused by the Marburg virus\u2014often referred to as Ebola\u2019s deadly cousin\u2014 currently has no cure and an average fatality rate of 50%.\n\nScientists are currently working on treatment options for this deadly disease. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the West African country of Ghana had announced its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD). The Ghana Health Services confirmed the rare disease caused by the Marburg virus in two unrelated males ages 26 and 51 who died within the southern Ashanti region of the country. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal also confirmed the disease results and corroborated them with Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. \u201cHealth authorities have responded swiftly, getting a head start preparing for a possible outbreak,\u201d says Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa in an official press release. \u201cThis is good because, without immediate and decisive action, Marburg can easily get out of hand. WHO is on the ground supporting health authorities and now that the outbreak is declared, we are marshaling more resources for the response,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat is the Marburg virus? The Marburg virus is an animal-borne virus belonging to the viral family Filoviridae \u2014 the same family as the Ebola virus. Scientists first discovered the Marburg virus in 1967 when laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and Belgrade, Yugoslavia (modern-day Serbia) showed signs of a hemorrhagic fever followed by exposure to infected African monkeys. Since then, there have been about 600 cases of infection in humans by the Marburg virus, including outbreaks in Angola and Uganda .\n\nHow is someone infected by the Marburg virus? The Marburg virus causes Marburg virus disease (MVD). The main carrier of the Marburg virus is the African fruit bat. A person can become infected through prolonged exposure to infected bats in caves or mines, as well as contact with an infected animal\u2019s bodily fluids or feces. Once a person becomes contracts the Marburg virus, it can be spread between humans through contact with a person\u2019s bodily fluids , including blood, saliva, sweat, semen, vomit, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. Infection can occur through direct contact with a person\u2019s bodily fluids, as well as if the fluids are on a surface or material, such as clothes or bedding. Those who come in close contact with a person\u2019s bodily fluids, such as healthcare workers, are at a higher risk of contracting MVD from infected patients. Those taking care of sick family members can become exposed to MVD, as can those who work in burial services as a person who dies from MVD is still infectious after death. The Marburg virus can also infect non-human primates, such as monkeys and gorillas. According to Dr. Jonathan Towner, lead of the Virus Host Ecology Section in the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), historically, the people at highest risk for contracting MVD include family members and hospital staff who care for patients carrying Marburg virus and have not used proper infection prevention and control measures. \u201cCertain occupations, such as veterinarians and laboratory or quarantine facility workers who handle non-human primates from Africa, may also be at increased risk of exposure to Marburg virus,\u201d he told MNT. \u201cExposure risk can be higher for those travelers visiting endemic regions in Africa who have contact with or come close proximity to Egyptian rousette bats present in caves or mines where these bats typically live.\u201d\n\nWhat are the symptoms? The incubation period of infections with the Marburg virus can last anywhere from two to 21 days before symptoms appear. Symptoms of MVD include: fever and/or chills\n\nheadache\n\nmuscle aches and pains\n\nnausea and/or vomiting\n\nsore throat\n\ndiarrhea\n\nnon-itchy rash on the chest, back, and/or stomach\n\nhemorrhagic-related issues, including bleeding nose, gums, on the skin, and/or in the eyes Fatality rates for MVD range from 24% to 88%, depending on virus strains and management, with the average MVD fatality rate around 50%.\n\nHow is Marburg virus disease treated? There is currently no specific treatment for MVD. Right now, healthcare professionals treat the different symptoms of MVD as they emerge. And if hospitalized, doctors treat patients with MVD with supportive therapies such as rehydration and replacing blood loss through hemorrhagic-related symptoms. There are some potential medications for MVD currently under research. A study in 2018 showed successful treatment of MVB in a mouse model using the antiviral drug Favipiravir . More recently, a report in May 2022 found an rVSV-based candidate vaccine provided protection from MVD in a guinea pig model."

        "Vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety symptoms, study shows",
        "Share on Pinterest Scientists have found evidence that certain B vitamins may help in reducing anxiety symptoms. berkpixels/Getty Images Researchers studied the impact of vitamins B6 and B12 to see how well either vitamin may work at reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nStudy participants took high doses of their assigned vitamin for about a month.\n\nParticipants who took vitamin B6 saw a statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms, indicating improved functioning of GABA, the neurotransmitter associated with calming and relaxing. Everyone may feel anxious or sad at times. However, some people may experience life-disrupting levels of these emotions on a regular basis, developing into a mental health disorder that requires treatment. Researchers at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom studied how vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 may impact anxiety and depression levels. Vitamins B6 and B12 are present in foods such as chickpeas and tuna, but the research team tested the vitamins at much higher levels than those found in food. Their findings were published in the journal Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental .\n\nMental health quick facts Anxiety and mood disorders can affect people of all ages, from children to older adults. There are several types of disorders that fall under the umbrella of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), around 31% of adults in the United States experience any anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. Additionally, around the same percentage of young adults (ages 13-18) experience an anxiety disorder. The NIMH reports that around 8.4% of all adults in the U.S. experienced a depressive episode in 2020, making depression one of the most prevalent mental health conditions. Medical providers often opt to treat anxiety and mood disorders with a combination of therapy and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy are two popular therapy options. There are a number of prescription treatments for anxiety, including benzodiazepines (such as Xanax or Ativan) and buspirone. Also, certain antidepressants can help treat both anxiety and depression, which include SSRIs (such as Lexapro or Zoloft) and tricyclics (such as Anafranil or Tofranil). People with anxiety and depression also occasionally try natural treatments to improve their symptoms and use herbal supplements such as ashwagandha and valerian.\n\nLarge amounts of B6, B12 The researchers wanted to learn to what degree vitamins B6 and B12 can affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) processing. GABA is a neurotransmitter that can calm the nervous system and may contribute to someone developing anxiety or depression. \u201cThe functioning of the brain relies on a delicate balance between the excitatory neurons that carry information around and inhibitory ones, which prevent runaway activity,\u201d says Prof. David Field, lead author of the study and associate professor at the University of Reading\u2019s School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences. The inhibition-excitation balance being off in the brain has been linked to anxiety, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Additionally, the authors write, that some people may experience visual and other sensory disturbances in many of these mental health conditions, \u201cand these are thought to be related to excitation-inhibition imbalances in the visual cortex.\u201d According to the authors, \u201cVitamin B6 is involved in a number of other pathways that are likely to reduce neural excitation.\u201d Vitamin B12 shares two of the same pathways, so the researchers wanted to test it as well to see what effect it would have. The researchers recruited an initial group of 478 participants who had self-reported anxiety and/or depression. They were randomly chosen to receive vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or a placebo. The B6 tablets contained 100 milligrams of B6, while the B12 tablets had 1,000 micrograms of B12. This far exceeded the daily dietary allowance recommended by the Food and Drug Administration , which is 1.7mg for B6 and 2.4mcg for B12. The researchers screened the participants for anxiety and depression before and after the vitamin or placebo regimens using the Screen For Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) and Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). The researchers had the participants complete visual and tactile tests at the end of the trial.\n\nThe vitamin that helped The study results indicated that vitamin B6 can be helpful in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms. The B6 participants saw a significant reduction in their SCAARED and MFQ tests compared to the placebo group. \u201cVitamin B6 helps the body produce a specific chemical messenger that inhibits impulses in the brain, and our study links this calming effect with reduced anxiety among the participants,\u201d says Prof. Field. Additionally, in testing at the end of the trial, the B6 group showed an increase in \u201cthe surround suppression of visual contrast detection.\u201d The authors write that this testing \u201cargues for an inhibitory GABA-related underlying mechanism.\u201d While the participants in the vitamin B12 group reported a slight improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms compared to the placebo group, the researchers did not consider it significant. The authors noted that \u201cit is possible that the 1-month supplementation period in the present study was insufficient for the effects of B12 supplementation.\u201d"

        "Study finds heart conditions extremely rare after COVID-19 vaccination",
        "Share on Pinterest Lorenzo Viola/EyeEm/Getty Images A Canadian study shows that myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations are extremely rare.\n\nThis research also suggests that spacing out second doses to 30 days and offering Pfizer vaccines over Moderna might lower the risk of developing these conditions in men ages 12-29.\n\nExperts stress that developing COVID-19 poses a greater risk of myocarditis and pericarditis than being vaccinated. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts at the University of Alberta in Canada have analyzed evidence on the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination and found the risk is low, including among young men. These conditions, typically caused by viral infections, involve inflammation of heart tissues. The findings do confirm that the issues occur more frequently among young males shortly after a second dose of the mRNA vaccine. Most cases have been mild, and the risk appears to be higher after receiving Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine than Pfizer\u2019s counterpart. The researchers propose that using Pfizer over Moderna and spreading out dosing intervals might reduce risks for younger individuals. This study appears in the BMJ .\n\nmRNA vaccines and heart conditions Myocarditis refers to the inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis occurs when there is inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart. Both conditions are typically caused by a viral infection. The conditions are rare but serious. Fortunately, most people fully recover. An uptick in cases after COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations has generated concern among medical and public health leaders. Reports first appeared in April 2021, leading to monitoring side effects after vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines. Pediatric and heart specialists at the University of Alberta analyzed over 8,000 cases after combing through 46 studies. They started investigating records of people in every age group and zoned in on individuals 0-39 years of age. According to the researchers, incident rates in adults ages 40 years and older were \u201cvery low to none.\u201d How frequent are they? The researchers noted that the overall rates of myocarditis are 1-2 cases per 100,000 person-years in the United States. Person-years is a measurement used in prospective studies where researchers consider the number of participants involved and how much time each person spends in the study. If a study followed 100 people for 20 years, the research would contain 2,000 person-years of data. The study found that rates of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are 0.2 per one million people \u2014 and 1.4 per one million for pericarditis. They found that adolescent and young adult males had the highest incidences of myocarditis after receiving mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The findings are in keeping with historical tendencies concerning this condition. Male teens ages 12-17 years had 50-139 cases per million, and male adults ages 18-29 had 28-147 cases per million. Moderna vs. Pfizer Medical News Today discussed this study with Dr. Jorge Moreno, an assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. He was not involved in the study. Dr. Moreno agreed that cases of COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis are rare. He also stressed that \u201cCOVID, the illness, can also [cause] myocarditis, and that is much more likely than the vaccine itself [causing it].\u201d Dr. Moreno mentioned that some European nations prefer the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which appears to carry a lower risk of myocarditis than the Moderna vaccine. However, he added, \u201cthe FDA and the CDC here in the U.S. did not find that the difference was substantial enough to make that recommendation.\u201d Change dosing schedule? The researchers also found that the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis may be lower if people receive their second vaccine dose more than 30 days after the first. Data specific to young males suggests that increasing dosing intervals to over 56 days may significantly reduce rates of the conditions. Dr. Moreno felt that more studies are needed to evaluate the idea of spacing vaccine doses. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend that people under 18 receive a booster shot.\n\nThe study\u2019s limitations The authors stressed that data for risk factors were limited. They hope that future studies will include tissue samples and long-term follow-up to \u201cenhance understanding of mechanism[s]\u201d driving the heart conditions. The COVID-19 landscape is rapidly changing, calling for constantly evolving research. In a linked editorial , some U.S. researchers pointed out that risks related to boosters and vaccinating young children remain unclear. The long-term outcomes of people who develop myocarditis are also yet to be understood."

        "'Blood washing' for long COVID: What is it, and is it safe?",
        "Share on Pinterest Why are more and more people with long COVID traveling for \u2018blood-washing\u2019 treatments? Image credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images. The medical community is engaged in research regarding long COVID, but few conclusions or approved therapies have as yet emerged.\n\nDesperate for relief from the life-altering symptoms of long COVID, some patients are turning to experimental treatments, such as blood-washing and blood-thinning.\n\nSuch experimental treatments are often expensive, with a new investigative feature reporting that some are spending their life savings in hopes of a cure for long COVID. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is general agreement that long COVID is a genuine medical condition, it is one that remains ill-defined, and treatment options remain unclear. For those with life-disrupting long COVID symptoms, the lack of authorized medical interventions can be aggravating and frustrating. An investigative feature published this week in The BMJ describes the experience of some people who have felt driven to take treatment of their long COVID symptoms into their own hands. The paper reports that thousands of people with long COVID have turned to clinics that offer blood washing, or apheresis, and blood-thinners, or anticoagulants, as treatments. People often access these treatments in foreign locations, which requires a significant outlay of money for travel, accommodations, and the treatments themselves. BMJ Investigations Editor Madlen Davies , who authored the paper with ITV, told Medical News Today: \u201cThe treatments \u2014 [and] the travel and accommodation abroad \u2014 are very expensive, and people are spending thousands on them. While some believe these are promising treatments for long COVID, others believe desperate patients are spending life-changing sums on invasive, unproven treatments.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning behind apheresis treatments Apheresis is a generally safe procedure in which blood passes through a large needle from one arm through a filtration system then and back into the other arm. The filtering in long COVID treatment removes inflammatory proteins and lipids. Some offer apheresis as a treatment for long COVID based on the hypothesis that microscopic blood clots \u2014 or microclots \u2014 produced by COVID-19 infection are clogging capillaries, thus reducing a person\u2019s oxygen supply. While some question the origin of such microclots, Dr. Douglas B. Kell, from the Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, told MNT in no uncertain terms that \u201c[p]eople who say that the origin of the microclots is not known are either being lazy in not reading the literature, or willfully ignorant.\u201d \u201cThe mechanisms by which the microclots explain observables such as fatigue are also clear,\u201d said Dr. Kell, adding that there is evidence showing \u201cthat spike protein alone is sufficient to induce the fibrinaloid microclots in normal plasma.\u201d Dr. Etheresia Pretorius, from the Department of Physiological Sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, said that her research confirms the role of microclots in long COVID. \u201cThe microclots that we are finding in long COVID are the consequences of the original acute COVID that simply has never been resolved,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt is now accepted that acute COVID significantly affects the vasculature, and we know that there are numerous inflammatory molecules in circulation in acute COVID. We found microclots and platelet hyperactivation in acute COVID, too,\u201d noted Dr. Pretorius. \u201cWe have also found numerous inflammatory molecules entrapped inside these microclots in long COVID. Widespread vascular damage and platelet hyperactivation are also present and clinically significant,\u201d she added. Yet in the BMJ feature, Dr. Robert Ari\u00ebns, professor of vascular biology at the University of Leeds School of Medicine asks: \u201cThey [microclots] may be a biomarker for disease, but how do we know they are causal?\u201d Concerns about blood thinners Anticoagulants can carry serious risks for patients, and treatment with anticoagulants requires close supervision by physicians. At some long COVID clinics, patients receive prescriptions for anticoagulants after returning home from treatment sites, and experts cited in the paper express concern about the rigorousness of follow-up monitoring. Long COVID patients want treatment Dr. Pretorius said: \u201cPatients need diagnosis and treatments and clinical trials to test suggested treatment options. The longer we leave patients without treatment, the more organ damage will happen, including the development of auto-antibodies, as some of my collaborators have already found and warned against.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she lamented, \u201cpatients \u2014 including clinicians with long COVID \u2014 had to start their own advocacy groups, simply because they have not been supported or worse, totally ignored.\u201d"

        "12 myths about IBD",
        "Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY.\n\n1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d\n\n2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD.\n\n4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\n\n5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d\n\n6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery.\n\n7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d\n\n8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d\n\n9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD.\n\n10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.\n\n11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure."

        "COVID-19: How the first lockdown changed our creativity",
        "New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nWhat were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity.\n\nThe role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem"

        "Mental health and the pandemic: Issues and solutions",
        "Share on Pinterest After 2 years of COVID-19, what does mental health look like, worldwide? Image credit: Boy_Anupong/Getty Images. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nFear and isolation The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress. Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nWorldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d\n\nWho is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d\n\nOn the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d\n\nTaking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d"

        "What to know about decision fatigue during the pandemic",
        "Share on Pinterest What is decision fatigue, and how has this phenomenon evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Kayla Snell/Stocksy. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision fatigue happens when, after making many decisions at once, a person\u2019s ability to make decisions declines. Complex decisions, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, deplete one\u2019s capacity for decision making especially quickly. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32% of adults in the United States struggled to make basic decisions, such as what to wear, due to COVID-19-induced stress. Different age groups reported experiencing the phenomenon at different rates: 48% of millennials\n\n37% of Generation Z\n\n32% of Generation X\n\n14% of baby boomers\n\n3% of older adults These findings correspond with the survey\u2019s findings on stress levels. Younger groups were significantly more likely to report high stress levels than older groups. Parents with children under 18 years old were also disproportionately affected by stress compared with those without children. While 47% of these parents reported that day-to-day decisions were more stressful than before the pandemic, the same was true for 30% of those without children under 18 years old. People of Color have also been more affected by pandemic-related stress. According to the study, 38% of Hispanic adults and 36% of Black adults reported that pandemic-related stress impacted their decision making, compared with 29% of non-Hispanic White adults. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nHow the concept came to be Decision fatigue happens when a person becomes fatigued or exhausted from making too many decisions. It affects a person\u2019s ability to make further decisions, whether simple, such as deciding what to eat for dinner, or complex, such as determining whether or not to change jobs. The concept of decision fatigue originated in 1998. It centers on the idea that humans have a limited capacity to regulate their behavior. This means that after a certain point, people simply run out of energy to make decisions, much like a car running out of fuel once its petrol tank is empty. Running out of \u201cdecision making fuel\u201d is also known as ego depletion. Ego depletion changes the way we focus on and process information to make decisions, as well as our motivations. These motivational shifts can make a person more likely to make impulsive decisions that, under normal circumstances, they would not make. \u201cDoing repeated decision making [that] involves trade-offs between multiple competing values, such as risks and benefits\u201d increases a person\u2019s risk of experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g, an associate professor at Linkoping University in Sweden, told Medical News Today. \u201cCareful consideration of pros and cons in decision making is mentally taxing and may lead to decision fatigue when we feel stressed and mentally overloaded. This can lead people to shy away from engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning when tired and instead turn to decision\u2010making heuristics, that is, mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions on the basis of simple rules of thumb without engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g But decision fatigue does not just happen from making decisions. It can happen from any activity that demands the exertion of self-control. Dr. Grant A. Pignatiello, an instructor and clinical research scholar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told MNT that \u201c[d]ecision fatigue can manifest after repeated or effortful attempts of self-control.\u201d \u201cThe most common example is from making decisions. But it can also result from controlling your emotions, doing things that require cognitive effort, or intense physical exertion,\u201d he noted.\n\nSusceptibility Several factors are associated with a higher risk of decision fatigue, including: chronic exposure to stress and work complexity\n\nto stress and work complexity low knowledge and experience of independent decision making and a lack of direct managerial supervision\n\nand a lack of direct managerial supervision a high workload\n\na lack of time to make decisions Dr. Pignatiello said that everyone is susceptible to decision fatigue. However, the exact causes will differ from person to person: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the circumstances that lead to decision fatigue are unique for every person \u2014 for example, two individuals doing the same thing may experience different levels of decision fatigue. For a literal example, running a 5K may deplete your tank more than it would a person who runs every day.\u201d He added that the demands of modern everyday life, alongside modern work environments, necessitate complicated decisions that may make some more susceptible to decision fatigue than others.\n\nHow to spot decision fatigue Signs of decision fatigue include brain fog, feeling tired, and other signs of physical or mental fatigue. These may intensify the more decisions a person makes throughout the day. When asked how people may be able to spot whether or not they are experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Tingh\u00f6g said, \u201cIf there are drifts in the type of decision you are making throughout the day, without there being a logical explanation, this could be due to decision fatigue.\u201d \u201cBut also, it is possible to identify decision fatigue through introspection,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we feel that we don\u2019t have enough mental energy to make a thorough deliberation before an important decision, we are suffering from decision fatigue.\u201d Dr. Pignatiello also noted: \u201cIt requires some self-awareness for us to know when we may be in a state of decision fatigue. Some common signs include struggling with decisions that otherwise would not require much thought, e.g., \u2018What do I eat for dinner?\u2019 \u2018What should I wear?\u2019, feeling overwhelmed by our emotions, having a harder time remembering things or focusing, or simply just feeling more \u2018drained\u2019 than normal.\u201d"

        "Tips to Save Yourself from Summer's Deadly Heat Waves",
        "Summer has only just officially started, and it is already a scorcher. Many areas of the country are facing record-breaking heat, which is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk.\n\nUnfortunately, this trend of more intense and frequent heatwaves isn\u2019t just a coincidence. According to the Lancet Medical Journal, climate change is increasing the frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves. In 2020, adults over the age of 65 in the U.S. experienced a total of nearly 300 million more days of heatwave exposure compared to the 1986-2005 average baseline, making it the second highest year of exposure recorded since 1986. According to the US Global Change Research Program's Climate and Health Assessment, climate change could cause tens of thousands of premature heat-related deaths each summer by the end of the century.\n\n\"The global rise in temperature is putting us all at risk, regardless of where we live,\" said Dr. Brian Christman, medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association.\n\nHere's what you need to know about heat waves and how to protect yourself from this increasing threat:\n\n1. Heat makes air pollution worse.\n\nGround-level ozone pollution, often called smog, is a common threat during the hot summer months. Ozone develops in the atmosphere from gases that come out of tailpipes, smokestacks and many other sources. When these gases come in contact with sunlight, they react and form ozone. Ozone is one of the most dangerous pollutants in the United States and is more likely to form in hot, stagnant air. So, more heat waves = more ozone pollution and more danger to your health. Ozone aggressively attacks lung tissue by reacting chemically with it and acts like a sunburn on the lungs. It can cause immediate breathing problems and lead to serious health effects over time\u2014even early death.\n\n2. Understand your risk.\n\nMany people may be surprised to learn that, according to the American Lung Association's \"State of the Air\" more than 4 in 10 Americans live in areas with dangerous levels of ozone or particle pollution. Though anyone who spends time outside where pollution levels are high is at risk, children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with lung disease are particularly vulnerable. People who work and exercise outside are also at a higher risk from air pollution. And just because you aren't near sources of pollution like highways, smokestacks, and factories doesn't mean you aren't at risk, because air pollution can travel far distances. \"Pollutants released from the top of urban smokestacks can be picked up by prevailing winds and travel long distances before affecting people, even in rural areas. The smoke from the catastrophic rural wildfires can also distribute over hundreds of miles affecting large numbers of us, even those who live in urban centers. So, you can see, all of us are at risk,\" said Dr. Christman.\n\n3. Extreme heat can aggravate illness.\n\nIn addition to the health risks of pollution, extreme heat itself can take a toll on your body and lungs. Breathing in hot, humid air can exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. \"The heat increases metabolic demands, which might not be a problem for a conditioned, heat-adapted athlete, but could be deadly for someone with advanced heart or lung disease who is barely getting by,\" Dr. Christman commented. \"Older patients tend to have less recognition of thirst and water depletion and may be taking medications that decrease awareness of thirst. On very hot days they can lose a lot of volume through perspiration which results in a fall in blood pressure, or even blacking out.\"\n\n4. Know how to protect yourself from unhealthy air.\n\nOne of the easiest changes you can make to protect your family is to check the air quality forecasts in your community. Avoid exercising or working outdoors when the forecast warns unhealthy air (an orange level or higher) is expected. The Lung Association also has 10 Tips to Protect Yourself from Unhealthy Air to help you make some easy changes that may help guard against these deadly pollutants.\n\nWhen the weather report says extreme heat is coming, Dr. Christman urges everyone to:\n\nStay inside in the air conditioning during the hottest part of the day.\n\nWear appropriate clothing (put away the wool flannel trousers and switch to shorts).\n\nDrink plenty of fluids.\n\nAvoid excess intake of alcohol, which blunts awareness of thirst and induces fluid loss.\n\nUse fans to increase evaporative heat loss.\n\nKeep an eye on your elderly neighbors. They may need assistance in reaching medical care if the heat gets to them.\n\n5. Take action to protect health from climate change.\n\nAs climate change continues to advance, it becomes harder and harder to clean up ozone pollution. To protect human health from the worst impacts, we need to act to address climate change and reduce ozone pollution. Among many other steps needed to address climate change, transitioning to zero-emission vehicles and electricity are critical steps.\n\nYour voice matters: Please urge the Biden Administration to help transition the United States to zero-emission vehicles and electricity."

As we chart the range between the upper and lower bounds of uncertainty for WHO regions, we are able to observe the relative availability of data for each region and how data gaps disproportionately impact some parts of the world more than others. If the uncertainty bounds are larger, this indicates that there is less available data and therefore, a corresponding greater degree of uncertainty.

Having considered the views of Committee Members and Advisors as well as other factors in line with the International Health Regulations, the Director-General has determined that the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n\nThe WHO Director-General also considered the views of the Committee in issuing the set of Temporary Recommendations presented below.\n\n\n\n===\n\nTemporary Recommendations issued by the WHO Director-General in relation to the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox\n\n\n\nThese Temporary Recommendations apply to different groups of States Parties, based on their epidemiological situation, patterns of transmission and capacities. Each State Party, at any given point in time, falls either under Group 1 or under Group 2. Some State Parties may also fall under Group 3 and/or Group 4.\n\nAll Temporary Recommendations are expected to be implemented in full respect of established principles of human rights, inclusion and the dignity of all individuals and communities.\n\nGroup 1: States Parties, with no history of monkeypox in the human population or not having detected a case of monkeypox for over 21 days\n\n1.a. Activate or establish health and multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms to strengthen all aspects of readiness for responding to monkeypox and stop human to human transmission.\n\n1.b. Plan for, and/or implement, interventions to avoid the stigmatization and discrimination against any individual or population group that may be affected by monkeypox, with the goal of preventing further undetected transmission of monkeypox virus. The focus of these interventions should be: to promote voluntary self-reporting and care seeking behaviour; to facilitate timely access to quality clinical care; to protect the human rights, privacy and dignity of affected individuals and their contacts across all communities.\n\n1.c. Establish and intensify epidemiological disease surveillance, including access to reliable, affordable and accurate diagnostic tests, for illness compatible with monkeypox as part of existing national surveillance systems. For disease surveillance purposes, case definitions for suspected, probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox should be adopted.\n\n1.d. Intensify the detection capacity by raising awareness and training health workers, including those in primary care, genitourinary and sexual health clinics, urgent care/emergency departments, dental practices, dermatology, paediatrics, HIV services, infectious diseases, maternity services, obstetrics and gynaecology, and other acute care facilities.\n\n1.e. Raise awareness about monkeypox virus transmission, related prevention and protective measures, and symptoms and signs of monkeypox among communities that are currently affected elsewhere in this multi-country outbreak (e.g., importantly, but not exclusively, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) or individuals with multiple sexual partners) as well as among other population groups that may be at risk (e.g., sex workers, transgender people).\n\n1.f. Engage key community-based groups, sexual health and civil society networks to increase the provision of reliable and factual information about monkeypox and its potential transmission to and within populations or communities that may be at increased risk of infection.\n\n1.g. Focus risk communication and community support efforts on settings and venues where intimate encounters take place (e.g., gatherings focused on MSM, sex-on-premises venues). This includes engaging with and supporting the organizers of large and smaller scale events, as well as with owners and managers of sex on premises venues to promote personal protective measures and risk-reducing behaviour.\n\n1.h. Immediately report to WHO, through channels established under the provision of the IHR, probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox, including using the minimum data set contained in the WHO Case Report Form (CRF).\n\n1.i. Implement all actions necessary so as to be ready to apply or continue applying the set of Temporary Recommendations enumerated for Group 2 below in the event of first-time or renewed detection of one or more suspected, probable or confirmed cases of monkeypox.\n\n\n\nGroup 2: States Parties, with recently imported cases of monkeypox in the human population and/or otherwise experiencing human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus, including in key population groups and communities at high risk of exposure\n\n2.a. Implementing coordinated response\n\n2.a.i. Implement response actions with the goal of stopping human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus, with a priority focus on communities at high risk of exposure, which may differ according to context and include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Those actions include: targeted risk communication and community engagement, case detection, supported isolation of cases and treatment, contact tracing, and targeted immunization for persons at high risk of exposure for monkeypox.\n\n2.a.ii. Empower affected communities and enable and support their leadership in devising, contributing actively to, and monitoring the response to the health risk they are confronting. Extend technical, financial and human resources to the extent possible and maintain mutual accountability on the actions of the affected communities.\n\n2.a.iii. Implement response actions with the goal of protecting vulnerable groups (immunosuppressed individuals, children, pregnant women) who may be at risk of severe monkeypox disease. Those actions include: targeted risk communication and community engagement, case detection, supported isolation of cases and treatment, contact tracing. These may also include targeted immunization which takes into careful consideration the risks and benefits for the individual in a shared clinical decision-making.\n\n2.b. Engaging and protecting communities\n\n2.b.i. Raise awareness about monkeypox virus transmission, actions to reduce the risk of onward transmission to others and clinical presentation in communities affected by the outbreak, which may vary by context, and promote the uptake and appropriate use of prevention measures and adoption of informed risk mitigation measures. In different contexts this would include limiting skin to skin contact or other forms of close contact with others while symptomatic, may include promoting the reduction of the number of sexual partners where relevant including with respect to events with venues for sex on premises, use of personal protective measures and practices, including during, and related to, small or large gatherings of communities at high risk of exposure.\n\n2.b.ii Engage with organizers of gatherings (large and small), including those likely to be conducive for encounters of intimate sexual nature or that may include venues for sex-on-premises, to promote personal protective measures and behaviours, encourage organizers to apply a risk-based approach to the holding of such events and discuss the possibility of postponing events for which risk measures cannot be put in place. All necessary information should be provided for risk communication on personal choices and for infection prevention and control including regular cleaning of event venues and premises.\n\n2.b.iii. Develop and target risk communication and community engagement interventions, including on the basis of systematic social listening (e.g., through digital platforms) for emerging perceptions, concerns, and spreading of misinformation that might hamper response actions.\n\n2.b.iv. Engage with representatives of affected communities, non-government organizations, elected officials and civil society, and behavioural scientists to advise on approaches and strategies to avoid the stigmatization of any individual or population groups in the implementation of appropriate interventions, so that care seeking behaviour, testing and access to preventive measures and clinical care is timely, and to prevent undetected transmission of monkeypox virus.\n\n\n\n2.c. Surveillance and public health measures\n\n2.c.i. Intensify surveillance for illness compatible with monkeypox as part of existing national surveillance schemes, including access to reliable, affordable and accurate diagnostic tests.\n\n2.c.ii. Report to WHO, on a weekly basis and through channels established under the provision of the IHR, probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox, including using the minimum data set contained in the WHO Case Report Form (CRF).\n\n2.c.iii. Strengthen laboratory capacity, and international specimens referral capacities as needed, for the diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection, and related surveillance, based on the use of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), such as real time or conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n2.c.iv. Strengthen genomic sequencing capacities, and international specimens referral capacities as needed, building on existing sequencing capacities worldwide, to determine circulating virus clades and their evolution, and share genetic sequence data through publicly accessible databases.\n\n2.c.v. Isolate cases for the duration of the infectious period. Policies related to the isolation of cases should encompass health, psychological, material and essential support to adequate living. Any adjustment of isolation policies late in the isolation period would entail the mitigation of any residual public health risk.\n\n2.c.vi. During the isolation period, cases should be advised on how to minimise the risk of onward transmission.\n\n2.c.vii. Conduct contact tracing among individuals in contact with anyone who may be a suspected, probable, or confirmed case of monkeypox, including: contact identification (protected by confidentiality), management, and follow-up for 21 days through health monitoring which may be self-directed or supported by public health officers. Policies related to the management of contacts should encompass health, psychological, material and essential support to adequate living.\n\n2.c.viii. Consider the targeted use of second- or third-generation smallpox or monkeypox vaccines (hereafter referred to as vaccine(s)) for post-exposure prophylaxis in contacts, including household, sexual and other contacts of community cases and health workers where there may have been a breach of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n2.c.ix. Consider the targeted use of vaccines for pre-exposure prophylaxis in persons at risk of exposure; this may include health workers at high risk of exposure, laboratory personnel working with orthopoxviruses, clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for monkeypox and communities at high risk of exposure or with high risk behaviours, such as persons who have multiple sexual partners.\n\n2.c.x. Convene the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) for any decision about immunization policy and the use of vaccines. These should be informed by risks-benefits analysis. In all circumstances, vaccinees should be informed of the time required for protective immunity potentially offered by vaccination to be effective.\n\n2.c.xi. Engage the communities at high risk of exposure in the decision-making process regarding any vaccine roll out.\n\n2.d. Clinical management and infection prevention and control\n\n2.d.i. Establish and use recommended clinical care pathways and protocols for the screening, triage, isolation, testing, and clinical assessment of suspected cases of persons with monkeypox; provide training to health care providers accordingly, and monitor the implementation of those protocols.\n\n2.d.ii. Establish and implement protocols related to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, encompassing engineering and administrative and the use of PPE; provide training to health care providers accordingly, and monitor the implementation of those protocols.\n\n2.d.iii Provide health and laboratory workers with adequate PPE, as appropriate for health facility and laboratory settings, and provide all personnel with training in the use of PPE.\n\n2.d.iv. Establish, update, and implement clinical care protocols for management of patients with uncomplicated monkeypox disease (e.g., keeping lesions clean, pain control, and maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition); with severe symptoms; acute complications; as well as for the monitoring and management of mid- or long-term sequelae.\n\n2.d.v. Harmonise data collection and report clinical outcomes, using the WHO Global Clinical Platform for Monkeypox.\n\n2.e. Medical countermeasures research\n\n2.e.i. Make all efforts to use existing or new vaccines against monkeypox within a framework of collaborative clinical efficacy studies, using standardized design methods and data collection tools for clinical and outcome data, to rapidly increase evidence generation on efficacy and safety, collect data on effectiveness of vaccines (e.g., such as comparison of one or two dose vaccine regimens), and conduct vaccine effectiveness studies.\n\n2.e.ii. Make all efforts to use existing or new therapeutics and antiviral agents for the treatment of monkeypox cases within a framework of collaborative clinical efficacy studies, using standardized design methods and data collection tools for clinical and outcome data, to rapidly increase evidence generation on efficacy and safety.\n\n2.e.iii. When the use of vaccines and antivirals for monkeypox in the context of a collaborative research framework is not possible, use under expanded access protocols can be considered, such as the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI), under certain circumstances, using harmonized data collection for clinical outcomes (such as the WHO Global Clinical Platform for Monkeypox).\n\n2.f. International travel\n\n2.f.i. Adopt and apply the following measures:\n\nAny individual: With signs and symptoms compatible with monkeypox virus infection; or being considered a suspect, probable, or confirmed case of monkeypox by jurisdictional health authorities; or Who has been identified as a contact of a monkeypox case and, therefore, is subject to health monitoring,\n\nshould avoid undertaking any travel, including international, until they are determined as no longer constituting a public health risk. Exemptions include any individual who need to undertake travel to seek urgent medical care or flee from life-threatening situations, such as conflict or natural disasters; and contacts for whom pre-departure arrangements to ensure the continuity of health monitoring are agreed upon by sub-national health authorities concerned, or, in the case of international travel, by national health authorities;\n\nCross-border workers, who are identified as contacts of a monkeypox case, and, hence, under health monitoring, can continue their routine daily activities provided that health monitoring is duly coordinated by the jurisdictional health authorities from both/all sides of the border.\n\n2.f.ii. Establish operational channels between health authorities, transportation authorities, and conveyances and points of entry operators to:\n\nFacilitate international contact tracing in relation to individuals who have developed signs and symptoms compatible with monkeypox virus infection during travel or upon return;\n\nProvide communication materials at points of entry on signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox; infection prevention and control; and on how to seek medical care at the place of destination;\n\nWHO advises against any additional general or targeted international travel-related measures other than those specified in paragraphs 2.f.i and 2.f.ii.\n\n\n\nGroup 3: States Parties, with known or suspected zoonotic transmission of monkeypox, including those where zoonotic transmission of monkeypox is known to occur or has been reported in the past, those where presence of monkeypoxvirus has been documented in any animal species, and those where infection of animal species in countries may be suspected including in newly affected countries\n\n3.a. Establish or activate collaborative One Health coordination or other mechanisms at federal, national, subnational and/or local level, as relevant, between public health, veterinary, and wildlife authorities for understanding, monitoring and managing the risk of animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission in natural habitats, forested and other wild or managed environments, wildlife reserves, domestic and peri-domestic settings, zoos, pet shops, animal shelters and any settings where animals may come into contact with domestic waste.\n\n3.b. Undertake detailed case investigations and studies to characterize transmission patterns, including suspected or documented spillovers from, and spillback, to animals. In all settings, case investigation forms should be updated and adapted to elicit information on the full range of possible exposures and modes of both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. Share the findings of these endeavours including ongoing case reporting with WHO.\n\n\n\nGroup 4: States Parties with manufacturing capacity for medical countermeasures\n\n4.a. States Parties who have manufacturing capacity for smallpox and monkeypox diagnostics, vaccines or therapeutics should raise production and availability of medical countermeasures.\n\n4.b. States Parties and manufacturers should work with WHO to ensure diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, and other necessary supplies are made available based on public health needs, solidarity and at reasonable cost to countries where they are most needed to support efforts to stop the onward spread of monkeypox.\n\n\n\nProceedings of the meeting\n\nThe second meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox was convened by Zoom, with the Chair and Vice-Chair being present in person on the premises of WHO headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nMembers and Advisers joined by videoconference. Overall, 15 of the 16 Committee\u2019s Members and all 10 Advisers to the Committee participated in the meeting.\n\nThe WHO Director-General welcomed the Committee, noting that he had reconvened them to assess the immediate and medium-term public health implications of the evolution of the multi-country monkeypox outbreak and provide their views on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nThe WHO Director-General expressed concern about the number of cases, in an increasing number of countries, that have been reported to WHO and highlighted the challenges presented due to the complexity of transmission patterns in different Regions. He additionally stressed his awareness that determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) involves the consideration of multiple factors, with the ultimate goal of protecting public health.\n\nThe Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and the mandate of the Emergency Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR.\n\nThe Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics briefed Members and Advisers on their roles and responsibilities. Members and Advisers were also reminded of their duty of confidentiality as to the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee, as well as their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or direct conflict of interest. Each Member and Adviser who was present was surveyed. No conflicts of interest were identified.\n\nThe meeting was handed over to the Chair of the Emergency Committee, Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele who introduced the objectives of the meeting: to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a PHEIC, and, if so, to review the proposed temporary recommendations to States Parties.\n\n\n\nPresentations\n\nThe WHO Secretariat presented the global epidemiological situation, highlighting that between 1 January 2022 and 20 July 2022, 14,533 probable and laboratory-confirmed cases (including 3 deaths in Nigeria and 2 in the Central African Republic) were reported to WHO from 72 countries across all six WHO Regions; up from 3,040 cases in 47 countries at the beginning of May 2022.\n\nTransmission is occurring in many countries that had not previously reported cases of monkeypox, and the highest numbers of cases are currently reported from countries in the WHO European Region and the Region of the Americas.\n\nThe majority of reported cases of monkeypox currently are in males, and most of these cases occur among males who identified themselves as gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), in urban areas, and are clustered in social and sexual networks. Early reports of children affected include a few with no known epidemiological link to other cases.\n\nThere has also been a significant rise in the number of cases in countries in West and Central Africa, with an apparent difference in the demographic profile maintained than that observed in Europe and the Americas, with more women and children amongst the cases.\n\nMathematical models estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to be above 1 in MSM populations, and below 1 in other settings. For example, in Spain, the estimated R0 is 1.8, in the United Kingdom 1.6, and in Portugal 1.4.\n\nThe clinical presentation of monkeypox occurring in outbreaks outside Africa is generally that of a self-limited disease, often atypical to cases described in previous outbreaks, with rash lesions localized to the genital, perineal/perianal or peri-oral area, that often do not spread further, and appears prior to the development of lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, and pain associated with lesions.\n\nThe mean incubation period among cases reported is estimated at 7.6 to 9.2 days (based on surveillance data from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and the United States of America (United States). The mean serial interval is estimated at 9.8 days (95% CI 5.9-21.4 day, based on 17 case-contact pairs in the United Kingdom).\n\nA small number of cases have been reported among health workers. Investigations so far have not identified cases of occupational transmission, although investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe Secretariat noted that, although the number of cases and countries experiencing outbreaks of monkeypox appear to be rising, the WHO risk assessment has not changed since the first meeting of the Committee on 23 June 2022, and the risk is considered to be \u201cmoderate\u201d at global level and in all six WHO Regions, except for European region, where it is considered to be \u201chigh\u201d.\n\nModelling work conducted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Commission\u2019s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) suggests that isolation of cases and contact tracing could be effective in bringing the outbreak under control. However, the operational experience gained to date in responding to this event, indicates that the implementation of such interventions in practice is extremely challenging \u2013 the identification of cases is hampered by barriers to access diagnostic testing; the isolation of cases for 21 days is difficult in the current COVID-19 pandemic-related post-lockdowns context; and contact tracing is difficult as contacts are often multiple and may be anonymous. The modelling by ECDC and HERA is suggesting that the addition of vaccination-related interventions can increase the chances of controlling the outbreak, with pre-exposure prophylaxis of individuals at high-risk of exposure appearing to be the most effective strategy to use vaccines when contact tracing is less effective, or impracticable. However, the limited data on vaccine effectiveness against monkeypox constitutes one of the limitations of the modelling work conducted. Additionally, the operationalization of such vaccination strategy presents challenges, including those related to vaccine access.\n\nThe genome sequence of the virus obtained in several countries shows some divergence from the West African clade. Work is ongoing to understand whether the observed genomic changes lead to phenotypic changes such as enhanced transmissibility, virulence, immune escape, resistance to antivirals, or reduced impact of countermeasures.\n\nAlthough many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the monkeypox virus in the natural setting (e.g., rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates), there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to other susceptible animal species in different settings. To date, there is currently no documented evidence of instances of anthropozoonotic transmission available to the WHO Secretariat or its One Health partners the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).\n\nThe WHO Secretariat also outlined the WHO response so far, and the ongoing work to develop the WHO Strategic Readiness and Response Plan for monkeypox, with its overall goal being to stop human-to-human transmission.\n\nRepresentatives of Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Nigeria updated the Committee (in this order) on the epidemiological situation in their countries and their current response efforts. With the exception of Nigeria, the remaining four countries reported that 99% of cases were occurring in MSM, and mainly among those with multiple partners.\n\nIn Spain, cases have been decreasing over the past few weeks, but it is likely the data are incomplete because of delays in reporting. Most cases have been reported in major urban areas, with very few reports of cases among females and children who had epidemiological links to MSM. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with vaccination is being offered to health workers, contacts and people living with HIV, but vaccine supplies are low.\n\nThe United Kingdom reported on a few severe cases of monkeypox (including encephalitis), and it is also planning to modify its case definition for monkeypox, to include newly recognized conditions such as proctitis. Environmental investigations have identified monkeypox virus DNA (presumed to be infectious because of moderate Ct values) on surfaces in hospitals and households. The vaccine strategy is targeted and aims to interrupt transmission through post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-exposure prophylaxis among MSM at highest risk.\n\nIn the United States, cases of monkeypox are widely distributed across the country, although most cases are concentrated in three large cities. While a few cases have occurred in children and a pregnant woman, 99% are related to male-to-male sexual contact.\n\nIn Canada, 99% of cases have occurred among MSM, and the country is taking a broad approach to pre-exposure prophylaxis, given the challenges with contact tracing; and is strongly focused on engagement with community-led organizations supporting key affected populations groups.\n\nNigeria recorded a little over 800 cases of monkeypox between September 2017 and 10 July 2022 and has seen at 3% case fatality ratio among confirmed cases. Cases are predominantly in men aged 31 to 40 years; there was no evidence of sexual transmission presented. The highest number of annually reported cases since 2017 has been observed in 2022.\n\nFollowing the presentations, the Committee Members and Advisers proceeded with a questions and answers session for both the Secretariat and the presenting countries.\n\nThe Committee continues to be concerned about a broad range of issues, including the following: the need for further understanding of transmission dynamics; the impact of the fear of stigma on health-seeking behaviour among MSM; the potential implications on rights-based delivery of care by Ministries of Health and other authorities; the challenges related to the use of public health and social measures to stop onward transmission, including isolation, access to testing and contact tracing, particularly because of multiple anonymous contacts; planned large local and international gatherings focused on MSM and associated public and private satellite events, conducive for increased opportunities for exposure through intimate sexual encounters and subsequent amplification of the outbreak; the need for continuous evaluation of interventions that may have an impact on transmission (e.g., one-dose versus two-dose vaccination regimens and vaccine effectiveness in general, given the apparent permucosal exposures that are causing infection in some cases); and the identification of key activities for targeted risk communications and community engagement, working in close partnership with affected communities, and providing the necessary support for community-led organizations to play their important role in the response to the outbreak.\n\nThere was particular concern about how vaccines and antivirals would be priced and distributed in the near future and made available in an equitable manner.\n\n\n\nDeliberative session\n\nThe Committee reconvened in a closed meeting to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the Temporary Recommendations, drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.\n\nAt the request of the Chair, the WHO Secretariat reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled the definition of a PHEIC under the IHR: an extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through international spread, and which potentially requires a coordinated international response.\n\nThe Committee reviewed evidence gathered by the Secretariat against the considerations proposed during its first meeting for re-assessing the outbreak. The Committee noted the generally moderate level of confidence in the available data to make any informed determination on these considerations.\n\nOf the nine considerations put forward, based on currently available data, two of them have seen a significant change since the previous meeting \u2013 an increased number of countries reporting the first case(s) of monkeypox, and an increase of the number of cases in some West and Central African countries. There was evidence of a small increase of the overall growth rate associated with the outbreak. While cases among health workers have been reported, most reported community exposure. A limited number of cases among sex workers has been reported from case reports and social media listening. Secondary transmission to some children and women was reported. Limited transmission was reported to have been observed among vulnerable groups (immunosuppressed individuals, pregnant women, or children, although a small number of children were reported not to have an epidemiological link to another case. While cases experiencing severe pain continue to be reported, with some hospitalizations required to manage pain or secondary infection, and while clinical severity of cases overall remained generally unchanged since the previous meeting, a few severe cases, two ICU admissions and five deaths have been reported. At the present time, there is no data currently available about potential spillback from humans to animals. With regards to the potential changes in the virus genome, investigations are ongoing in relation to the reports of changes that may affect features of the virus. There has to date not been any reported circulation of the virus clade normally present in Central Africa outside of the usual settings.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nCommittee Members expressed a range of views on the considerations before them. They were unable to reach consensus regarding advice to the WHO Director-General on whether the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox should or should not be determined to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Supportive elements regarding the views expressed by the Members of the Committee in favour or not in favour of such a determination are summarized below. Such views reflected:\n\n\n\nCommittee Members\u2019 views in support of the prospective determination of a PHEIC\n\nThe multi-country outbreak of monkeypox meets all the three criteria defining a PHEIC contained in Article 1 of the Regulations ([...] an extraordinary event [\u2026] (i) constitut[ing] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) which may potentially require a coordinated international response);\n\nThe moral duty to deploy all means and tools available to respond to the event, as highlighted by leaders of the LGBTI+ communities from several countries, bearing in mind that the community currently most affected outside Africa is the same initially reported to be affected in the early stages of HIV/AIDS pandemic;\n\nThe observed rising trends in the number of cases reported globally, in an increasing number of countries, and, yet, likely to reflect an underestimation of the actual magnitude of the outbreak(s);\n\nThe cases of monkeypox reported in children and pregnant women, which are reminiscent of the initial phases of the HIV pandemic;\n\nFuture waves of monkeypox cases are expected as the monkeypox virus is introduced in additional susceptible populations;\n\nThe modes of transmission sustaining the current outbreak are not fully understood;\n\nThe changes in the clinical presentation of cases of monkeypox currently observed with respect to the clinical picture known to date;\n\nThe need to generate further evidence related to the effectiveness of the use of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures in controlling the outbreak;\n\nThe significant morbidity associated with the monkeypox outbreak(s);\n\nThe potential future implications on public health and health services if the disease were to establish itself in the human population across the world, particularly for an orthopoxvirus causing human disease, as global immunity has greatly declined after smallpox was eradicated;\n\nThe perceived benefits associated with the prospective determination of a PHEIC include: Maintaining a heightened level of awareness and alert, which would increase the probability of stopping human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus; Boosting political commitment towards response efforts; Increasing opportunities for funds to be released for response, and research purposes, as well as for the mitigation of the socioeconomic impact of the disease; Boosting international coordination of response efforts, in particular to secure equitable access to vaccines and antivirals; The possible stigmatization, marginalization, and discrimination that may result from the prospective determination of a PHEIC should not be regarded as deterrent to do so, and would need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nCommittee Members\u2019 views NOT in support of the prospective determination of a PHEIC\n\nThe overall global risk assessment presented by the WHO Secretariat remained unchanged with respect to that presented to the Committee on 23 June 2022;\n\nThe greatest burden of the outbreak is currently reported in 12 countries in Europe and in the Americas, with no indications, based on currently available data, of an exponential increase in the number of cases in any of those countries, and early signs of stabilization or declining trends observed in some countries;\n\nThe vast majority of cases are observed among MSM with multiple partners, and, despite the operational challenges, there is the opportunity to stop ongoing transmission with interventions targeted to this segment of the population. Cases observed beyond this population group, including among health workers are, to date, limited;\n\nThe severity of the disease is perceived to be low;\n\nThe epidemic is gaining maturity, with future waves expected, and clearer indications about the effectiveness of policies and interventions are being generated;\n\nThe potential risks of hampering response efforts through the prospective determination of a PHEIC are perceived as outweighing the benefits of the latter for the following reasons: The stigma, marginalization, and discrimination that a determination of a PHEIC may generate against the currently affected communities, especially in countries where homosexuality is criminalized, LGBTI+ communities are not well established and engaged in a dialogue with governments. Communities in some countries have reportedly indicated that minimizing stigma associated with monkeypox \u2013 which unlike HIV infection may be a visible condition\u2013 requires developing novel approaches, which could be challenging in the context of a PHEIC; Action taken by the WHO Secretariat since May 2022 to raise the alert in relation to the unfolding monkeypox outbreak, including convening the Committee, appear to be effective, in triggering immediate response efforts in many countries in the northern hemisphere; Technical guidance issued by the Secretariat to inform national response efforts is regarded as adequate and comprehensive, with no identified impediments preventing its implementation worldwide; For West and Central African countries, where capacity building for surveillance, laboratory, and response is needed, the determination of a PHEIC may not be regarded as a tool for triggering nor for boosting such efforts; The determination of a PHEIC would unnecessarily and artificially increase the perception of the risk of the disease in the general public, which, in its turn, would translate into generating demand for vaccines, which should be used wisely; Not determining a PHEIC would not mean \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. The communication of the WHO Director-General decision would still be an opportunity to convey the needed continuity of the full range of necessary public health actions, beyond a mere high visibility determination.\n\n\n\nFollowing the deliberations, Committee Members provided input to the proposed Temporary Recommendations previously outlined, should the WHO Director-General determine that the Multi-country outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a PHEIC.\n\n==="

        "WHO releases global COVID-19 vaccination strategy update to reach unprotected",
        "The global COVID-19 vaccination rollout is the biggest and fastest in history but many of those at greatest risk remain unprotected \u2013 only 28% of older people and 37% of health care workers in low-income countries have received their primary course of vaccines and most have not received booster doses.\n\nHealth care workers, over 60s and other at-risk groups must be reached as priorities on the way to reaching the 70% coverage target.\n\nWHO\u2019s strategy update elevates the targets of vaccinating 100% of health care workers and 100% of the highest risk populations with both primary and booster doses, with the aim of reducing deaths, keeping societies open and ensuring economies function as transmission continues.\n\nWhile vaccines have saved countless lives, they have not substantially reduced the spread of COVID-19. Innovation is needed to develop new vaccines that substantially reduce transmission, are easier to administer and give broader and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWHO published an update to the Global COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy today, in response to the spread of Omicron subvariants, advances in vaccine evidence, and lessons from the global vaccination program.\n\n\n\nIn the first year of rollouts, COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved 19.8 million lives. Through unprecedently large and rapid rollouts worldwide, over 12 billion doses have been administered globally, in nearly every country in the world, resulting in countries reaching 60% of their populations on average.\n\nYet only 28% of older populations and 37% of health care workers in low-income countries have been vaccinated with their primary series. 27 of WHO's Member States have not yet started a booster or additional dose program, 11 of which are low-income countries.\n\n\n\nThe strategy aims to use primary and booster doses to reduce deaths and severe disease, in order to protect health systems, societies and economies. On the way to reaching the 70% vaccination target, countries should prioritize achieving the underpinning targets of vaccinating 100% of health care workers and 100% of the most vulnerable groups, including older populations (over 60s) and those who are immunocompromised or have underlying conditions.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven where 70% vaccination coverage is achieved, if significant numbers of health workers, older people and other at-risk groups remain unvaccinated, deaths will continue, health systems will remain under pressure and the global recovery will be at risk,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cVaccinating all those most at risk is the single best way to save lives, protect health systems and keep societies and economies open.\u201d\n\nTo ensure vaccines reach the highest priority groups, the strategy emphasizes the need for measuring progress in vaccinating these groups and developing targeted approaches to reach them. Approaches include using local data and engaging communities to sustain demand for vaccines, building systems for vaccinating adults, and reaching more displaced people through humanitarian response.\n\nThe strategy also has the goal of accelerating development and ensuring equitable access to improved vaccines to substantially reduce transmission as the top priority but also to achieve durable, broadly protective immunity.\n\n\n\nCurrent vaccines were designed to prevent serious illness and death, which they have succeeded in doing, saving millions of lives. However, they have not substantially reduced transmission. As the virus continues to circulate widely, new and dangerous variants are emerging, including some which reduce the efficacy of vaccines. It is fundamental to continue investing in research and development to make more effective, easier to administer vaccines, such as nasal spray products.\n\n\n\nOther vital actions to take include: equitably distributing manufacturing facilities across regions and supporting strong vaccine delivery programs. WHO will continue to collaborate with COVAX and COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) partners to support countries with rollouts, such as through packaging COVID-19 vaccination with other health interventions.\n\n\n\nNote to editors:\n\nThe Global COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy in a Changing World: July 2022 update can be read in its entirety here."

        "Meet Delta Scorpii, aka Dschubba",
        "Finding (and pronouncing) Dschubba\n\nDelta Scorpii \u2013 aka Dschubba \u2013 is easy to spot as the middle star in the \u201cforehead\u201d or Crown of the Scorpion, Scorpius. And it\u2019s an extremely interesting star \u2013 well worth watching \u2013 unpredictably variable in a way that you can watch with your eyes alone.\n\nOn these northern summer evenings, we in the Northern Hemisphere see Scorpius and Delta Scorpii (Dschubba) in our southern sky. For Southern Hemisphere viewers, they are closer to overhead. Scorpius is an easy constellation to find, because of its curved \u201ctail\u201d of stars. And the brightest star in Scorpius, Antares, will catch your eyes.\n\nTo the west of Antares, you\u2019ll find a little arc of three stars. They are tiny, but noticeable. Dschubba, the middle star, is usually the brightest of the three.\n\nHow do you pronounce Dschubba? The \u201cD\u201d is silent. So now we are left with \u201cschubba\u201d. It is two syllables, emphasizing the first: SCHUB ba. Something like \u201cshoe ba\u201d. Hear some pronunciations of Dschubba here.\n\nYou can also simply call the star Delta Scorpii.\n\nDelta Scorpii: Forehead, claw or Crown?\n\nDelta Scorpii derives its name from the Arabic phrase meaning \u201cthe forehead\u201d of the Scorpion. This part of the constellation is also sometimes called \u201cthe claws\u201d of the Scorpion.\n\nBut most stargazers know that the Scorpion\u2019s true claws once extended well beyond the boundaries of Scorpius and into the constellation of Libra. At some point, far back in the history of our sky, the Scorpion\u2019s claws were clipped to make room for Libra. Thus we now have 12 constellations of the zodiac.\n\nThe little arc of 3 stars above Antares is also called the Crown of the Scorpion.\n\nHow big and bright?\n\nDschubba is a moderately bright star in our sky. But it\u2019s relatively distant at 491 light years away. The light you see beaming from Dschubba tonight left the star in the year 1531. A lot has happened here on Earth since 1531. What has the starlight been doing? Some of it has been kidnapped. There is so much dust and gas between us and the star that half of the light has been reflected and absorbed in the past 491 years. So, what we see is only half as bright as it would be if we had a clear view.\n\nDschubba is a type B0 star, meaning it is hot, about 22,000 Kelvin, or four times hotter than our sun. It\u2019s a massive star too, with 13 times more mass than our sun. It\u2019s 5 times larger than our sun. And it\u2019s 14,000 times brighter than the sun.\n\n2 types of variability\n\nDschubba has not one but two types of variability. First, it shows irregular small brightness variations. Those variations happen every few days and are probably due to bright spots or clouds of gas between us and the star.\n\nThe second type of variability is eruptive and unpredictable.\n\nDschubba is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable star. That means it behaves like the star Gamma Cassiopeiae, the poster child for a star with these eruptive brightness changes.\n\nGamma Cassiopeiae \u2013 the middle star in the \u201cW\u201d of constellation Cassiopeia \u2013 is what\u2019s known as an eruptive variable star. Its magnitude, or brightness, has in the past varied between a bright magnitude 1.6 and a fainter magnitude 3.0. And it spins so rapidly that it occasionally flings off material. This material forms a disk of hot gas surrounding the star near its equator.\n\nAnd thus Gamma Cass brightens, not quickly, but slowly, over a few weeks to a few months. In 1937, Gamma Cassiopeiae brightened from magnitude 2.2 to 1.6 (the smaller the number, the brighter the star), then dimmed to magnitude 3.4. In the decades since, the star has slowly brightened to magnitude 2.3 again. But it has not repeated its behavior of 1937.\n\nOnly a few other such stars are known to exist, one being the star Dschubba.\n\nAn eruption disruption for Dschubba\n\nLike Gamma Cass, Dschubba rotates quickly. At the equator it reaches a rotational speed of 112 miles per second (181 km/s). This is 90 times faster than our sun. Dschubba rotates once every 45 hours. Our sun rotates once in about 27 days.\n\nAnd so Dschubba gets itself into trouble. Astronomers believe that, occasionally, the star throws off material that forms a disk around its equator. This would be a big disk, 150 times larger than our sun. It\u2019s this disk that causes changes in the brightness of Delta Scorpii.\n\nAt one time, Dschubba was a spectroscopic standard for the B0 IV star classification. But this variability in brightness got it removed from being a standard. You see, even stars misbehave and get kicked out of the class.\n\nIt has a companion\n\nDschubba is also part of a multiple-star system. It has a companion that is 10 times fainter, orbiting it every 20 days. So there is another star in this system, which might also trigger the brightness outbursts.\n\nThe second star gets as far away from the main star as our planet Saturn is from our sun. And it takes 10.8 years to orbit the main star. Every 10.8 years, the second star passes very close to Dschubba, and this passage might stir up the atmosphere of the main star, causing the main star to brighten. Or maybe not. Scientists are not sure about this; by examining the chart below, you might see the problem. The outburst that began in 2000 may have been related to the close passage of the star. Maybe not so with the passage in 2011. What will this most recent passage produce?\n\nSee for yourself\n\nWith the unaided eye, and within minutes, you can estimate the brightness of Delta Scorpii.\n\nSimply compare its brightness to other stars nearly. The non-variable stars are marked on the map below. While it might be tempting to use the star Antares in your estimations, avoid it because it also varies in brightness.\n\nTypically, Delta Scorpii is about magnitude 2.3, but it has been known to brighten up to magnitude 1.6. Remember, the higher the number, the fainter the object. So how bright is it tonight?\n\nA few tips\n\nTake your time. Compare the subject star (Delta Scorpii) to each of the labeled stars on the map. Is it brighter or fainter? Keep doing that, comparing the subject star to the other stars on the map. Avoid using stars near your horizon as extinction will make them appear fainter than they actually are.\n\nWhen you have arrived at a number, write it down, along with the date and time. Then go out again tomorrow night and do it again. After four or five nights, you will feel comfortable making magnitude estimates. You can even send in your results to the clearinghouse for star magnitude estimates: the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). You can submit data for free or pay a fee, join the organization, and receive a cartload of benefits. If you mention my name, I win a toaster. Not really. I get nothing. But you have the satisfaction of contributing to the science of Delta Scorpii.\n\nBottom Line: Delta Scorpii, also known as Dschubba, is a variable star in the constellation Scorpius. With the eyes alone, you can check its brightness for yourself, and for science."

        "Delta Aquariid meteor shower: All you need to know in 2022",
        "With the moon waning, start planning now for 2022\u2019s summer meteor season. Every year, 2 showers \u2013 the famous Perseids and the lesser known Delta Aquariids \u2013 converge in late summer. Around mid-July, Earth enters the meteor stream for each of these showers. In other words, you might see a Delta Aquariid \u2013 or a Perseid \u2013 anytime now. The Delta Aquariids always peak in late July. And the Perseids always peak around August 12 and 13. But \u2013 in 2022 \u2013 moonlight will interfere with Perseids\u2019 peak. So we recommend you watch in late July and early August \u2013 on multiple nights \u2013 to catch meteors in these two grand showers.\n\nWhen to watch: Watch late July through early August, mid-evening to dawn. There\u2019s a nominal predicted* peak on July 29, 2022. But don\u2019t worry too much about that peak date. Delta Aquariid meteors fly for weeks!\n\nNearest moon phase: In 2022, new moon falls at 17:55 UTC on July 28. And full moon will fall at 1:36 UTC on August 12. Take advantage of the moon-free mornings in late July and early August for watching the Delta Aquariids (and the Perseids).\n\nRadiant: Rises in mid-evening, highest around 2 a.m. and low in the sky by dawn.\n\nDuration of shower: July 18 to August 21.\n\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: The Delta Aquariids\u2019 maximum hourly rate can reach 20 meteors in dark skies with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky. If you\u2019re watching in early August, you\u2019ll be adding that number to however many Perseids you see.\n\nNote: Like May\u2019s Eta Aquariids, July\u2019s Delta Aquariids favors the Southern Hemisphere. Skywatchers at high northern latitudes tend to discount it. But the shower can be excellent from latitudes like those in the southern U.S. Delta Aquariid meteors tend to be fainter than Perseid meteors. So a moon-free dark sky is essential. About 5% to 10% of the Delta Aquariid meteors leave persistent trains, glowing ionized gas trails that last a second or two after the meteor has passed.\n\nReport a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it\u2019s fun and easy!\n\nThe Delta Aquariid\u2019s parent comet\n\nFrom Don Machholz, who has discovered 12 comets \u2026\n\nThe Delta Aquariid meteor shower\u2019s parent comet comes from the 96P/Machholz Complex.\n\nThe 96P/Machholz Complex is a collection of eight meteor showers, including the Delta Aquariids, plus two comet groups (Marsden and Kracht), and at least one asteroid (2003 EH1). These meteors showers, and these comets, appear to share a common origin (although they\u2019ve now diverged slightly in their orbits around the sun).\n\nThey are all related to the comet known as 96P/Machholz, which I discovered on May 12, 1986, from Loma Prieta Mountain in California.\n\nAt discovery, the comet was magnitude 10 and two degrees south of the Andromeda galaxy. I was using my 6-inch homemade binoculars for this find. Read the story of the discovery.\n\nAs a matter of fact, scientists had suspected the existence of the 96P/Machholz Complex in 2003. Finally, they fully described it in 2005, after conducting more studies.\n\nComet 96P/Machholz orbits the sun every 5.3 years and gets eight times closer to the sun than we are. That is, its perihelion distance is 0.12 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. So this comet comes well inside the orbit of Mercury. Over the course of 4,000 years, the comet\u2019s orbit changes in shape and tilt, so that it leaves particles throughout the inner solar system. It gets around!\n\nA recent study suggests that the material causing the Delta Aquariid meteor shower left the comet\u2019s nucleus about 20,000 years ago. It\u2019s old dust streaking across our skies.\n\nPerseid? Or Delta Aquariid?\n\nPerseid and Delta Aquariid meteors fly in our skies at the same time of year. How can you tell them apart? This is where the concept of a radiant point comes in handy. If you trace all the Delta Aquariid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from a certain point in front of the constellation Aquarius, which, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, arcs across the southern sky.\n\nMeanwhile, the Perseids radiate from the constellation Perseus, in the northeast to high in the north between midnight and dawn as seen in Northern Hemisphere skies.\n\nSo \u2013 assuming you\u2019re in the Northern Hemisphere, and watching around midnight or after \u2013 if you\u2019re watching the Perseids and you see meteors coming from the northeast or north \u2026 they are Perseids. If you see them coming from the south \u2026 they are Delta Aquariids. In a particularly rich year for meteors, if you have a dark sky, you might even see them cross paths!\n\nConsequently, it can be an awesome display.\n\nDelta Aquariid meteor shower photos from the EarthSky community\n\nSubmit your night sky photos to EarthSky here\n\nBottom line: The Delta Aquariid meteor shower lacks a definite peak. It rambles along steadily in late July and August, intermingling with the Perseids. In 2022, the best activity will be around new moon in late July and early August.\n\n*Predicted peak times and dates for 2022 meteor showers are from the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower peak times can vary.\n\nEverything you need to know: Perseid meteor shower"

        "Monkeypox: WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern",
        "Luke Taylor Portsmouth\n\nThe World Health Organization has declared the global monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) as public health measures taken fail to stem the disease\u2019s spread.\n\nA PHEIC is the highest level of alert that the UN health body can give and has been previously attributed to covid-19, polio, the 2014 outbreak of Ebola, and the spread of the Zika virus in 2016.\n\nGlobal health experts hope the decision will spark a more coordinated international response, further research into the disease, and the ramping up of vaccine production.\n\nWHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists on 24 July that he made the final call after opinions at an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting on Thursday were evenly split between those who believed monkeypox constituted a PHEIC and those who did not.\n\nTedros told journalists, \u201cWe have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little, and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations. For these reasons, I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\u201d\n\nThe emergency committee had convened a month earlier and concluded that the viral disease did not merit declaring a PHEIC. The decision confused public health experts, who said the committee appeared to conclude that it had met the necessary criteria to escalate the threat level.1\n\nThe spread of the disease has accelerated since the first emergency committee convened and appears to have driven the reversal of their previous judgement. As of 25 June, 3000 cases of monkeypox had been reported to WHO from 47 countries\u2014but by 23 July that number had increased to more than 16 000 cases from 75 countries and territories, causing five deaths.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region where we assess the risk as high,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cThere is also a clear risk of further international spread, although the risk of interference with international traffic remains low for the moment.\u201d\n\nMonkeypox has been endemic in west Africa for decades, where the illness is usually spread to people by infected wild animals. Until 2022 infections reported in Europe and North America were usually isolated cases linked to travel from Africa or animal trafficking.\n\nThis year the monkeypox virus, which is closely related to smallpox and produces similar symptoms, has spread to many countries which had never before reported cases and where the disease is now sustaining itself through human-to-human transmission.\n\nSome 70% of cases this year were reported in America and 15% in Europe, WHO data show.\n\n\u201cThe rate of spread of monkeypox has not slowed, and public health strategies have not shown a high rate of success,\u201d said Hugh Adler at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.2 The disease is \u201cpresenting in atypical ways,\u201d making contact tracing difficult, he added.\n\nFour sets of recommendations WHO officials have now drafted four sets of recommendations that countries should follow depending on their level of transmission. Countries with recently imported cases of monkeypox and those that are seeing human-to-human transmission are being asked to implement a coordinated response to stop transmission and protect vulnerable groups, increase public health surveillance and measures, and strengthen clinical management and infection prevention and control in hospitals and clinics. WHO will also work with civil society organisations to reduce stigma around the disease, which can deter people from accessing health services. WHO officials stressed that despite monkeypox meriting the highest level of concern, its epidemiological profile meant that it was not too late for countries to contain it. So far, 98% of infections have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM) and especially in those with multiple sexual partners. \u201cThat means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups,\u201d Tedros said. The disease has various modes of transmission, including skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and the touching of infected materials. The UK Health Security Agency lowered its threat level of monkeypox on 5 July as it said it had not spread beyond MSM, was not spreading easily, and rarely causing severe illness.3\n\nVaccines WHO is also recommending that countries accelerate research into the use of vaccines, therapeutics, and other tools to combat monkeypox. Piero Olliaro, professor of infectious diseases of poverty at the University of Oxford, said a lack of trial data on effectiveness and high prices have led to \u201cvery limited\u201d supplies of drugs and vaccines. Scaling up the production of monkeypox vaccines and ensuring that low and middle income countries have access to them must be a main goal if the outbreaks are to be contained, say global health experts. WHO previously announced that it was drawing up a vaccine sharing mechanism for the most affected countries but few details on the scheme have emerged. How quickly countries can deploy vaccines and other measures to contain monkeypox depends on \u201chow relevant and weighty a WHO declaration is perceived by governments, public bodies, and vaccine manufacturers and suppliers, as well as people at risk of monkeypox around the world,\u201d Adler said.2 Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta, said countries must act quickly and robustly to tackle the disease before it establishes itself in the human population. \u201cThe PHEIC is the first step and there is a lot of work that needs to be done,\u201d she said. Tedros announced that WHO member states are now considering whether they should improve the international health regulations and in particular the process for declaring a public health emergency of international concern."

The use of isolation to limit community spread of infectious diseases has not, however, been consigned to history. Isolation facilities were used in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and, on a larger scale, Ebola treatment centres were extensively used in West Africa in 2014-15 to break the chains of Ebola transmission.4\n\nGovernments revisited the idea of isolation facilities in response to covid-19 (box 1), especially in the early stages of the pandemic before vaccines became available, when predominant viral strains were less infectious and generally present in settings with low transmission.6 One abiding image from early 2020 was the construction of massive health facilities in Wuhan, China, to house, treat and isolate people with covid-19 during the first wave. Other countries followed suit by refurbishing hospitals, re-purposing existing large-scale facilities or expanding capacity at pre-existing purpose-built infectious disease facilities (table 1).\n\nBox 1 Isolation facilities for covid-19 An isolation facility is a dedicated place where people who test positive for covid-19 receive essential care and are provided with daily necessities, such as food, safe drinking water, and toiletries, as they recover.5 \u201cMandatory\u201d isolation means that everyone who meets certain criteria\u2014typically a positive test within a defined period, even if asymptomatic or with mild clinical symptoms that do not require hospital admission\u2014must be confined until they meet the criteria for discharge, are referred to other facilities, or die. This is different from quarantine (which isolates, temporarily, those considered at risk of spreading infection but not known to be infected), but both functions might sometimes be combined, as in New Zealand with its facilities for \u201cmanaged isolation and quarantine.\u201d RETURN TO TEXT\n\nTable 1 Isolation Facilities used in the response to COVID-19 View this table:\n\nThe argument for establishing isolation facilities was to curb onward transmission, especially within households7 and in large gatherings that could become \u201csuperspreader\u201d events.8 For isolation facilities to be effectively used, the public must have trust in those running the facilities, trust in those asking people to be isolated, and trust that complying with isolation will ultimately serve a beneficial purpose.9 However, reports of inequitable and unfair requirements associated with mandatory centralised isolation have surfaced\u2014isolation facilities can impose unnecessarily severe restrictions or criminalise people who are unable to make use of such facilities because of the high financial burden or family obligations. In Northern Argentina, for example, people in isolation centres were reportedly under constant police surveillance and were not allowed to leave. The centres also lacked proper ventilation and were overcrowded and unsanitary, making physical distancing difficult. Moreover, people who tested positive for covid-19 were confined together with others awaiting test results.10 In Hong Kong, some people refused to be admitted to isolation facilities citing reasons such as chaotic protocols within facilities and the inability to reach authorities handling admissions. Refusal was met with hefty fines and up to two months\u2019 imprisonment in some cases, which might have led many people to either not test or hide their test status from authorities.11 Reports have also exposed the suboptimal conditions under which some migrant workers in Singapore were isolated in their own dormitories, where they lacked prompt access to medical care and basic necessities.12\n\nIn our view, isolation facilities can have an important role in preventing and interrupting community transmission and safeguarding health systems, particularly before vaccines are available. But they should only be used if they do not infringe human rights and deliver person centred care and support.13\n\nExtensive costs for potential benefits In countries that advised people who tested positive for covid-19 to self-isolate, dedicated facilities provided a feasible alternative for people living in crowded, often multigenerational homes, slums, or other situations (such as refugee camps or prisons) where self-isolation would have been impossible. In New York City and Baltimore, for example, hotel quarantine and isolation programmes for people who were positive or suspected positive for covid-19, offered at no cost, were used as an alternative for those who could not otherwise isolate owing to housing instability or crowding.14 In some settings, spaces in isolation facilities were made available or even mandated in recognition that complete home isolation was difficult to achieve, especially in the face of competing demands for food and other necessities, childcare, or income crucial for survival.15 There was also recognition that home isolation could be extremely dangerous or even deadly for people experiencing domestic violence.14 These potential benefits notwithstanding, creating, repurposing, and maintaining isolation facilities can incur substantial costs and requires rapid resource mobilisation to ensure adequate space, ventilation, power supply, and sanitation.16 We need a large multidisciplinary workforce with expertise ranging from architecture and construction to logistics and supply chain and sanitation and health.517 Typically, assembling that workforce requires recruiting staff from the private sector, redeploying public sector workers, including those in the armed forces. In New Zealand, for example, managed isolation and quarantine facilities were staffed by police and military personnel, health professionals, seconded civil servants, and hotel staff. The actual costs of operating isolation facilities are not yet publicly available, but, given the range of resources required, the estimated cost of running an isolation facility is high. New Zealand\u2019s managed isolation and quarantine centres are estimated to have cost NZ$800m (\u20ac490 million) over 18 months in payments to hotels.18 A 2020 modelling study in Massachusetts estimated the cost of quarantine facilities at US$640 000 a month to rent and operate. It also modelled the costs of providing financial incentives and social support services for infected people and their contacts between March and December 2020. Those estimated costs would be in the range of US$300-570 million depending on the trajectory of infections. But the costs of maintaining such facilities with wraparound and economic support services were estimated to be outweighed by the costs that the health system might incur if cases were to surge uncontrollably.19 To meet the costs of its facilities, the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services in Sri Lanka drew upon international support to create isolation and treatment units at specialty hospitals and called on the Sri Lankan navy to provide the construction expertise and labour.20 It seems almost certain that other low resource countries will have struggled to maintain isolation facilities in the face of exponentially rising infections.21 There are other costs to consider, including human resources. Ideally, centralising resources to manage patients with mild to moderate symptoms at these facilities preserves tertiary care facilities for more severe covid-19 cases and non-covid-19 related services, protecting overall health system capacity.22 Singapore, for example, redeployed nurses from public sector ophthalmology centres to isolation facilities, and the shortfall of personnel was alleviated through the use of teleophthalmology services and other digital tools.23 Despite efforts to redistribute medical personnel across the health system, taking staff away from other services is likely to compromise them, especially where there is a pre-existing shortage of healthcare workers.2425 Isolation facilities are a logical intervention and have been used widely, but the benefits are largely theoretical and depend heavily on the way in which they are implemented, as most studies report outcomes using simulation models that might not accurately reflect their real world abilities to interrupt transmission, let alone the number of cases and deaths averted through the use of isolation facilities.26272829 Public acceptance of public health efforts to slow or stop transmission has been high in almost every jurisdiction, but, to realise potential benefits, public trust must be earned through person centred care. Otherwise, as was seen in Hong Kong and more recently in China, people with covid-19 will be deterred from coming forward.3031\n\nProviding person centred care in isolation facilities Fundamentally, isolation facilities should not be simply viewed as buildings in which to segregate infected people\u2014resources must be directed to the provision of person centred care. This means that people are isolated in a humane and respectful way, receive high quality physical and mental healthcare, and have their individual needs for food, shelter, and personal hygiene (soap, running water, menstrual products, and so on) recognised, and have a means to communicate with friends, family, or healthcare providers (wi-fi, electronic device charging capabilities, or tablets for patient use). In managed isolation and quarantine facilities in New Zealand, for example, mental health support was offered to people throughout their isolation period, provided by on-site health teams, and after discharge through telephone helplines.32 People in mandatory isolation facilities must have confidence in the quality of care they will receive and a clear understanding of protocols for entering the facility, what life inside the facility is like (including continuity of care when needed and the maintenance of connection with the outside world), and the requirements for discharge. Person centred care in isolation facilities would also include leisure space for people to gather safely in the facility. In Singapore, the newly converted facility at the Expo Convention Hall opened in February 2022. The facility was family oriented, enabling young children to be isolated together with their care givers in designated family rooms.33 Given the risks of gender based violence in confined settings, providing safe spaces for all genders is critical. This can be achieved by establishing protective mechanisms such as trained female staff and gender segregated sanitation amenities in all shared spaces that ensure privacy and access to gender specific health services.3435 Person centred care is also culturally appropriate, accessible, and inclusive. In practice, this means anticipating, preparing for, and accommodating a diverse range of needs and levels of support. Examples include efforts to support caretaking responsibilities (so that people are not unduly separated from close family members including children), as well as assurances that people without immigration documents will not be penalised or punitively detained, as was the communication in South Korea36 and Saudi Arabia.37 For vulnerable populations, including those working in the gig and informal economy, access to these facilities must come without catastrophic losses of income or livelihoods, which can be mitigated through income replacement or short term allowances. In most cases, people in mandatory isolation facilities (except incoming travellers that departed after travel regulations started) were not charged for their stay,3839 but arrangements varied in terms of the economic and social support provided to them. New Zealand and Singapore offered income protection such as allowances or short term income replacement to people in isolation facilities,4041 but elsewhere economic support was not provided for those isolating. In Peru, for example, economically vulnerable people such as informal sector workers did not benefit from income support and consequently were less able and willing to stay in isolation facilities.42 Finally, person centred care allows people in isolation to trust that their medical needs will be met. Clear protocols are needed for patient transfer and deciding when to discharge, with well functioning mechanisms for referral to other parts of the health system, both to more advanced facilities in case of acute illness and to primary care for continuity after discharge. Isolation facilities must be staffed by a trained and protected multi-professional health workforce, adequately compensated and equipped with supplies, including personal protective equipment and medicines to ensure that essential care can be delivered even during surges. The creation of isolation facilities need not draw extensive resources from the health system, but existing infrastructure can be re-purposed and human resource gaps filled by training and deploying retired medical workers, medical and nursing students, and personnel beyond the health system to reduce the effects felt in other areas of the health system. Isolation facilities will also challenge newly formed teams operating in unfamiliar conditions to provide high quality care, which can be alleviated by rigorous simulation exercises and contingency planning.4344\n\nA time and a place for isolation facilities? Isolation facilities are not a panacea but are one component of a comprehensive pandemic response to emerging infectious hazards. As public authorities begin to shift their attention to future pandemic preparedness planning or perhaps more virulent emerging strains of covid-19 alongside waning immunities, the range of experiences gained in creating and operating isolation facilities for covid-19 offer some lessons for their use. Isolation facilities provide a crucial opportunity to limit community transmission at the beginning of any new highly contagious infectious disease threat and when community transmission is low. If transmission rises, then isolation facilities might remain useful on a non-mandatory basis for those unable to safely self-isolate at home.45 Recent experience has shown that isolation facility policies can pivot to meet evolving needs during an infectious outbreak, adjusting to fluctuating case numbers, hospital capacity, and vaccine coverage. Community isolation facilities in Singapore, for example, transitioned from a facility that housed all symptomatic cases to being used as step-down facilities for those discharged from hospitals or requiring closer monitoring to preserve tertiary hospitals for more severe cases.46 Although there have been successful examples of policies using isolation facilities, concerns about public trust and acceptability warrant greater reflection. High profile reports have exposed less than ideal conditions, highly restricted movement, and at times lack of prompt access to medical support and basic necessities.4748 But the New Zealand example indicates that isolation facilities can function in ways that ensure a safe patient journey through the provision of adequate pastoral care and clear communication channels, which in turn do not deter sick people from being tested.49 Trust in the mandatory isolation process is likely to be especially low among marginalised groups, such as undocumented migrants, and of course trust also depends on previous experiences with public health authorities and political leaders.50 Throughout the pandemic, some have argued, although with little evidence, that measures such as mandatory isolation are more acceptable in East Asian countries than in western ones.51 Although this is a generalisation, the public\u2019s view of this approach might reflect the role of the state in recent decades and the track record of responding to past health emergencies in East Asia. Singapore\u2019s successful management of the 2003 SARS outbreak, for example, fostered trust in the government that mobilised collective action and compliance with public health measures during the covid-19 pandemic.5253 Other factors, such as high levels of social support including commensurate and accessible financial packages for those in isolation, might also influence the acceptability of isolation facilities.48 Community engagement and clear communication on policies and services related to isolation must be central to the use of isolation facilities to ensure that they are person centred and to build and sustain public support.5054 The importance of this kind of approach was evidenced during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In eastern Sierra Leone, for example, health authorities undertook communication campaigns, such as airing positive experiences from survivors over the radio, to build trust and confidence in the use of Ebola treatment centres in response to widespread scepticism and public resistance.55 Isolation facilities are, at best, only one component of a comprehensive public health strategy, particularly in the early stages of outbreaks guided by an understanding of the often changing epidemiological situation. Other complementary measures to reduce transmission include the use of face masks in public enclosed spaces, robust testing and tracing systems linked to supported isolation at home where possible, restrictions on large gatherings, and ensuring the availability of vaccines.5657 Isolation facilities have the potential to interrupt transmission, yet the extent to which they do so in practice is less clear. In future we must prepare to quickly and robustly evaluate and report on care and outcomes in these facilities. Key messages Isolation facilities have historically been used to limit community spread of infectious diseases\n\nGovernments revisited the idea to curb covid-19 transmission and safeguard health systems\n\nIsolation facilities were a feasible alternative when self-isolation was not possible, but reports of inequitable and unfair requirements regarding mandatory isolation have surfaced\n\nThey must be staffed by a trained, protected, and well equipped interdisciplinary workforce and oriented to person centred care\n\nIsolation facilities are but one component of a comprehensive public health strategy"

        "Jacqui Wise Kent\n\nCoinfection with two viruses\u2014AAV2 and an adenovirus, or less often the herpes virus HHV6\u2014may offer the best explanation for the recent cases of acute hepatitis seen in children, researchers believe.\n\nTwo studies, from London and Glasgow, independently found that AAV2 (adeno associated virus 2) was present at high levels in blood samples from patients with unexplained hepatitis.

        "Waning effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccines over six months since second dose: OpenSAFELY cohort study using linked electronic health records",
        "Results 1 951 866 and 3 219 349 eligible adults received two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, and 2 422 980 remained unvaccinated. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be similar across outcomes and vaccine brands. In the \u226565 years subgroup, ratios of adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.24) to 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) per four weeks. Despite waning vaccine effectiveness, rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death were substantially lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated adults up to 26 weeks after the second dose, with estimated vaccine effectiveness \u226580% for BNT162b2, and \u226575% for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in vaccinated people were similar to or higher than in unvaccinated people (adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) for BNT162b2 and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) for ChAdOx1).\n\nWe did a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY-TPP database ( https://opensafely.org ), which includes detailed linked data on 24 million people (approximately 44% of the English population) registered with an English general practice using The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) SystmOne electronic health record software. We compared rates of covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related and non-covid-19 related mortality, and infection with SARS-CoV-2, between adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) vaccine and those who were unvaccinated.\n\nExamination of waning of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness is difficult. The success of vaccine rollouts in many countries means that only a small and selected proportion of the population remains unvaccinated and uninfected. Continuing uptake of vaccination, as well as ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2, further depletes this group over time. Vaccines were offered in priority order determined by age and clinical vulnerability, so that the longest follow-up is in people at the highest risk of severe covid-19. Rapid changes in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, related to pandemic control measures and introduction of new variants, make accounting for the calendar date on which events occurred essential. Many studies of waning covid-19 vaccine effectiveness have used \u201ctest negative case-control\u201d designs, restricted to people tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and comparing those testing positive (cases) and negative (controls) 5 9 17 18 or reported indirect evidence such as changing rates of covid-19 with time since vaccination. 11 12 The extent to which test negative case-control designs control bias due to confounding, or are biased because of the restriction to people who were tested, remains unclear. 19 20\n\nThe effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines, first shown in randomised trials, 1 2 has been confirmed with longer follow-up in observational studies. 3 4 5 However, neutralising antibody titres decrease with time since vaccination, 6 7 8 and vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time. 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The extent of waning of vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 is less clear: studies have found no evidence of waning, 9 10 17 modest waning, 5 11 or substantial waning. 12 Clarification of rates of waning effectiveness is needed to determine the frequency with which booster doses are needed and whether booster vaccination should be targeted at groups defined by age, clinical vulnerability, or brand of primary vaccine.\n\nPublic contributors were not involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No public contributors were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Covid-19 vaccination is offered to the whole population, including the researchers involved in the study. The main barriers to involving external public contributors were the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, which means that evidence quickly becomes outdated, and the urgent need to conduct and disseminate the research. OpenSAFELY invites any patient or member of the public to make contact with the project via https://opensafely.org/ .\n\nWe did all analyses independently in four vaccine priority subgroups: aged \u226565 years and in JCVI groups 2-5, aged 18-64 years and clinically vulnerable (JCVI groups 4 or 6), aged 40-64 years (JCVI groups 7-10; most people in this subgroup received ChAdOx1), and aged 18-39 years (JCVI groups 11-12; this subgroup received only BNT162b2). The \u226565 subgroup included participants who were clinically vulnerable, whereas the 40-64 and 18-39 subgroups did not. We fitted additional models separately in men and women to investigate effect modification by sex and in 65-74 and \u226575 years subgroups to investigate effect modification by age in older adults.\n\nWe used meta-regression to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of hazard ratios per comparison period. The ratios of hazard ratios can be interpreted as follows: if the hazard ratio in the three to six week comparison period is 0.5 and the ratio of hazard ratios is 1.2, then the hazard ratios will be 0.6 (=0.5\u00d71.2), 0.72 (=0.5\u00d71.2 2 ), 0.86 (=0.5\u00d71.2 3 ), 1.04 (=0.5\u00d71.2 4 ), and 1.24 (0.5\u00d71.2 5 ) in the 7-10, 11-14, 15-18, 19-22, and 23-26 week comparison periods respectively.\n\nTo estimate hazard ratios, we fitted Cox regression models with baseline hazards stratified by JCVI group, eligibility date, and region used to define the second vaccination periods, and with the covariates described above. To avoid problems with model convergence, we excluded binary covariates from the model if any cell of the table defined by cross tabulating the covariate with vaccine group and comparison period contained fewer than three events. For categorical covariates with more than two levels, levels were merged until either all levels had more than three events or only one level existed, in which case the variable was excluded. We carried out this process independently for each outcome. We modelled age within strata as linear, with quadratic terms additionally included for strata with age range >5 years.\n\nFor each comparison period, we estimated hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients versus unvaccinated people, ChAdOx1 recipients versus unvaccinated people, and BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 recipients. We did not estimate hazard ratios for comparison periods with fewer than three events in either group. For each person, follow-up ended at the earliest of the outcome of interest, deregistration from the primary care practice, death, or 15 December 2021. However, for SARS-CoV-2 test, follow-up ended at the \u201coutcome of interest\u201d only when the test result was positive. Fully vaccinated people who received a booster dose, and unvaccinated people who received a first dose were excluded from subsequent comparison periods, but follow-up within comparison periods was not censored after these events.\n\nModels were adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, sex (male or female), English Index of Multiple Deprivation (grouped by fifths), ethnicity (black, mixed, South Asian, white, other, as per the UK census), body mass index, learning disability, serious mental illness, number of comorbid conditions in different organ systems (supplementary table S3), current pregnancy, number of SARS-CoV-2 tests between 18 May 2020 (when widespread testing became available) and eligibility for first vaccine dose, and receipt of one or more flu vaccines in the five years before the start of the second vaccination period.\n\nThe outcomes were covid-19 related hospital admission (identified using Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient hospital records), covid-19 related death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-covid-19 related death. We also investigated test seeking behaviour by comparing rates of testing for SARS-CoV-2 between the vaccine groups. Covid-19 and non-covid-19 related deaths (death certificates with and without a covid-19 code) were based on death registry data from the Office for National Statistics. We identified SARS-CoV-2 tests by using SGSS records, on the basis of swab date. Both polymerase chain reaction and lateral flow tests were included, without differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We defined all outcomes by the date of their first occurrence during the comparison follow-up period. Where no positive SARS-CoV-2 test was present, but a record of covid-19 related hospital admission and/or death was recorded, we imputed the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test as the date of covid-19 related hospital admission or death.\n\nWe followed up unvaccinated people for the full eight calendar weeks that spanned the comparison periods for vaccinated people. To avoid overlap in follow-up of unvaccinated people between comparison periods (see lines corresponding to unvaccinated individuals E-L in figure 1 ), follow-up time for unvaccinated people was assigned at random to start either two or six weeks after the start of the second vaccination period and was split into the three consecutive eight week calendar periods during which vaccinated people were followed in each comparison period. Unvaccinated people assigned to start at two weeks were followed during comparison periods 1, 3, and 5, and those assigned to start at six weeks were followed during comparison periods 2, 4, and 6.\n\nIllustrative example showing definition of four week comparison periods, within strata defined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation group, eligibility date, and region. Horizontal lines represent follow-up time for four vaccinated and eight unvaccinated people, and colours of lines correspond to six comparison periods. Individuals A and D received their second vaccinations on first and last day of second vaccination period (SVP), respectively\n\nFigure 1 depicts the study design. The analysis timescale was calendar time, which ensured that vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared on the calendar day on which each outcome event occurred. We split follow-up time for fully vaccinated people into six consecutive four week \u201ccomparison periods,\u201d starting two weeks after receipt of the second dose. Because each second vaccination period was four weeks long and each vaccinated person was followed up for four weeks per comparison period, vaccinated people were followed during eight calendar weeks in each comparison period. Vaccinated people entered and finished follow-up on the calendar dates corresponding to the start and end of their comparison period.\n\nWe defined the second vaccination period as the four week period during which the greatest number of people in the stratum received their second dose. We excluded people from the vaccine groups if they received their first dose before their eligibility date, had an interval between first and second dose of less than six or more than 14 weeks, or were flagged as a healthcare worker on their vaccination record. We assigned people to the unvaccinated group if they had received no covid-19 vaccine at the start of the second vaccination period for their analysis stratum. We excluded people from any group if they had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by the start of their second vaccination period (either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in SGSS or probable covid-19 coded in primary care records), had ever been recorded as being resident in a care home, or had evidence of having started an end-of-life care pathway.\n\nWe defined three groups who received two doses of BNT162b2, received two doses of ChAdOx1, or were unvaccinated. Eligibility for the vaccinated groups was restricted to people who received their second vaccine dose during a four week \u201csecond vaccination period\u201d within analysis strata defined by UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority groups (supplementary table S1), eligibility date (for priority groups within which eligibility was based on age; supplementary table S2), and English NHS region (defined using individuals\u2019 primary care practice address).\n\nThis study was approved by NHS England. People were eligible for inclusion if they were aged \u226518 years on 1 July 2021 and had been registered with a primary care doctor for at least one year before eligibility for their first vaccine dose (the \u201celigibility date,\u201d supplementary table S2). People were excluded if they were aged >120 years on the date at which they became eligible for vaccination; their sex, geographical region, ethnicity, or English Index of Multiple Deprivation were unknown; or they were resident in a care home or medically housebound at six weeks after their eligibility date. Full details are in supplementary figure S1.\n\nWe observed no consistent differences between vaccine effectiveness in men and women. For ChAdOx1, adjusted hazard ratios seemed to be broadly similar in men and women. For BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 related hospital admission seemed to be somewhat greater in women than in men in the \u226565 subgroup but greater in men than in women in the 18-39 subgroup (supplementary tables S51-58; supplementary figures S32-35).\n\nEstimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 recipients consistently favoured BNT162b2 ( fig 3 ; supplementary table S7; ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in supplementary table S8). In the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios were 0.51 (0.33 to 0.79) and 0.36 (0.23 to 0.55), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission during weeks seven to 10; 0.58 (0.36 to 0.94) and 0.49 (0.20 to 1.18), respectively, for covid-19 related death during weeks 15-18; and 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88) and 0.35 (0.29 to 0.41), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks three to six. Because the rate of waning was slightly higher for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, the adjusted hazard ratios for both the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups were attenuated by weeks 23-26, but they still favoured BNT162b2 over ChAdOx1 (0.69 (0.61 to 0.78) and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.57), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission; 0.65 (0.48 to 0.86) and 0.54 (0.28 to 1.05), respectively, for covid-19 related death; and 0.75 (0.72 to 0.78) and 0.70 (0.67 to 0.72), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test).\n\nWe observed 1 406 181, 2 907 849, and 674 534 SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (only the first test in each comparison period counted; supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, rates of testing during weeks three to six were higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61) to 2.09 (2.03 to 2.15) for BNT162b2 and from 2.01 (1.95 to 2.08) to 2.79 (2.75 to 2.83) for ChAdOx1 (supplementary figure S30; supplementary tables S7 and S8). The discrepancy in testing behaviour between the vaccinated and unvaccinated people increased slightly by weeks 23-26; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 2.06 (2.00 to 2.13) to 3.06 (2.66 to 3.53) for BNT162b2 and from 2.31 (2.27 to 2.36) to 3.70 (3.64 to 3.76) for ChAdOx1.\n\nWe observed 8463, 9135, and 3031 non-covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios during weeks three to six ranged from 0.29 (0.24 to 0.35) to 0.47 (0.34 to 0.64) for BNT162b2 and from 0.29 (0.20 to 0.44) to 0.36 (0.30 to 0.44) for ChAdOx1 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). By weeks 23-26, these ranged from 0.55 (0.40 to 0.76) to 0.58 (0.48 to 0.69) for BNT162b2 and from 0.64 (0.43 to 0.95) to 0.74 (0.61 to 0.90) for ChAdOx1. Rates of waning were lower than for the other outcomes (maximum ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.19 (1.09 to 1.31); supplementary table S8).\n\nWe observed 62 363, 186 137, and 118 216 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). For BNT162b2 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios across subgroups ranged from 0.19 (0.13 to 0.27) to 0.27 (0.23 to 0.31) during weeks three to six and from 0.87 (0.78-0.97) to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). For ChAdOx1 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios ranged across subgroups from 0.43 (0.32 to 0.58) to 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81) and waned to 1.23 (1.11 to 1.36), 1.35 (1.29 to 1.41), and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively. For BNT162b2, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.29 (1.23 to 1.35), 1.30 (1.23 to 1.36), 1.32 (1.17 to 1.49), and 1.54 (1.50 to 1.59) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups, respectively (supplementary table S8). For ChAdOx1, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24), 1.14 (1.11 to 1.17), and 1.20 (1.16 to 1.25) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively.\n\nWe observed 329, 595, and 889 covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). In the \u226565 subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks three to six after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.12 (0.08 to 0.17) and 0.15 (0.11 to 0.21) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.31 (1.07 to 1.61) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. In the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks 15-18 after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.16) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.08 (0.04 to 0.18) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.20) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.38 (0.77 to 2.47) and 1.21 (0.99 to 1.49) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks 11-14 to 0.10 (0.04 to 0.22) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.66 (1.08 to 2.55) per period). Too few covid-19 related deaths occurred in the 18-39 subgroup to allow estimation of hazard ratios.\n\nWe observed 2100, 5369, and 9443 covid-19 related hospital admissions in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the \u226565 subgroup were 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.13) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.23), respectively, during weeks three to six after the second dose, waning to 0.20 (0.17 to 0.25) and 0.25 (0.21 to 0.29), respectively, during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were similar for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1: 1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40), respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.12) and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.14), respectively, during weeks three to six, waning to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.12) and 0.23 (0.19 to 0.26), respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35) and 1.20 (1.14 to 1.27) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.12 (0.10 to 0.15) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.24 (1.16 to 1.33) per period). Adjusted hazard ratios for BNT162b2 could not be estimated in the 40-64 subgroup because too few covid-19 related hospital admissions occurred. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-39 subgroup waned from 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.18 (0.10 to 0.29) during weeks 19-22 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.31 (1.10 to 1.57) per period).\n\nFigure 2 shows adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccination versus no vaccination across the six comparison periods. The slopes of the lines correspond to ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per comparison period (also shown in supplementary table S8). The missing adjusted hazard ratios could not be estimated because too few events occurred in one or both groups (supplementary table S5).\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios are shown in supplementary tables S6 and S7, respectively, and compared in supplementary figures S24-29, with adjusted hazard ratios for each covariate shown in supplementary tables S9-50. For the models comparing people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated people, the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were generally similar. Where they differed, patterns were outcome and subgroup specific. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were similar for comparisons of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1.\n\nSupplementary figures S20-23 show the distribution of follow-up by calendar time in each comparison period, for each subgroup, relative to dates during which different variants were dominant. Follow-up in the \u226565 subgroup began on 15 March 2021 (when the alpha variant was dominant) and ended on 30 November 2021. Follow-up for the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups began on 21 April, 18 May, and 23 July 2021, respectively: the delta variant was dominant in England by 1 June 2021. The latest follow-up was on 15 December 2021; 54% of specimens sampled in England on this date had S-gene target failure, which suggests that the omicron variant became dominant in England by this date. 24\n\nThe cumulative incidence of first vaccine dose by week 23 in previously unvaccinated people was 16%, 28%, 13%, and 14% in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups respectively (supplementary figure S19). The UK vaccination programme initially offered third doses only after six months (23-26 weeks) since the second dose 21 ; however, among the 18-39 subgroup, 35% and 26% of those in the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups, respectively, had received a third dose by week 20, because the required time since second dose was reduced to three months in early December 2021 owing to concerns about the omicron variant. 22 23\n\nOf 13 841 107 people satisfying initial eligibility criteria (supplementary figure S2), 5 222 812 received second doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 during the second vaccination period for their stratum (supplementary figures S3-18) and 2 575 111 were unvaccinated at the start of their second vaccination period. Of these, 1 951 866, 3 219 349, and 2 422 980 were eligible for inclusion in the first comparison period for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and unvaccinated groups, respectively. Table 1 and supplementary table S4 show summary statistics for these three groups by subgroup. Compared with vaccinated people, unvaccinated people were less likely to be white, to live in a more affluent area, to have had a flu vaccine in the previous five years, or to have tested for SARS-CoV-2 before their eligibility date. The distribution of other characteristics between vaccine groups differed according to subgroup. For example, in the \u226565 subgroup, those vaccinated with BNT162b2 were older than those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (75 (interquartile range 72-80) years) versus 72 (70-75) years, whereas the converse was true in the 40-64 subgroup (44 (41-50) years versus 55 (50-59) years).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis cohort study estimated the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccines during six consecutive periods, each of four weeks\u2019 duration, starting two weeks after receipt of second dose. Rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death were consistently and substantially lower among fully vaccinated people compared with those who remained unvaccinated, up to 26 weeks after the second vaccination, and consistently lower among people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 than with ChAdOx1. However, by 23-26 weeks, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test (ascertained through freely available national routine testing) in fully vaccinated people were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated people. Rates of non-covid-19 related death were consistently lower among fully vaccinated than unvaccinated people.\n\nWhen quantified as ratios of adjusted hazard ratios, estimated waning of vaccine effectiveness was strikingly similar across risk groups, except that waning was fastest in the 18-39 year subgroup (those at lowest risk of severe covid-19, all vaccinated with BNT162b2). In those subgroups in which the two vaccines could be compared, estimated vaccine effectiveness was consistently greater for BNT162b2 than for ChAdOx1, but waning was somewhat faster for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, so that the two brands\u2019 comparative effectiveness became more similar over time. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death remained \u22640.20 (\u226580% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2 and \u22640.25 (\u226575% vaccine effectiveness) for ChAdOx1 during weeks 23-26 after the second vaccination.\n\nFindings in context A systematic review and meta-regression of the duration of effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines included 18 studies, most of which evaluated BNT162b2 or Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 vaccine.13 Estimates of vaccine effectiveness and the duration of vaccine effectiveness varied substantially between studies. Only two studies found minimal vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection by six months, and none found decreases in vaccine effectiveness against positive SARS-CoV-2 test as large as those reported in our study.914 The meta-regression estimated an average decrease in vaccine effectiveness from one to six months after full vaccination across studies of 9.5 (95% confidence interval 5.7 to 14.6) percentage points for severe covid-19 (hospital admission or death due to covid-19), and of 20.7 (10.2 to 36.6) percentage points for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The corresponding reductions in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were: covid-19 related hospital admission 12.8 (7.41 to 18.2) for BNT162b2 and 11.7 (3.44 to 20.0) for ChAdOx1; positive SARS-CoV-2 test 68.2 (56.4 to 80.0) for BNT162b2 and 79.6 (62.0 to 97.2) for ChAdOx1. However, the ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were similar for covid-19 related hospital admission (1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) for BNT162b2 and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40) for ChAdOx1) and for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1.29 (1.23 to 1.35) for BNT162b2 and 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24) for ChAdOx1). Thus, the metric used to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness can lead to strikingly different conclusions about its magnitude. The review concluded that the decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 was less than for SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease. However, by quantifying waning in terms of ratios of hazard ratios, we found that rates of waning were similar for these two outcomes (supplementary table S8). As in our study, Andrews and colleagues analysed NHS England electronic health records data to investigate the duration of protection by covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic and severe covid-19.5 They used a test negative case-control design, which aims to reduce confounding due to health seeking behaviour by considering only people who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.25 However, this restriction to the subpopulation of people who are tested if they have symptoms has potential biases. For example, if older people were more likely to seek testing when they had symptoms then vaccine effectiveness in the tested subpopulation may differ from that in the general population.20 The restriction to those tested can also induce so-called \u201ccollider bias,\u201d because associations between causes of being tested are distorted in the tested subpopulation.26 Comparisons between this study and that of Andrews and colleagues are restricted to the \u226565 and 40-64 subgroups, as these are identically defined in the two studies, and to the 15-18 weeks comparison period in this study and the 15-19 weeks since second dose in the other study, which were the most similar across the two studies. Compared with Andrews and colleagues, we consistently estimated lower effectiveness for both vaccines against covid-19 related hospital admission (differences ranged from 1.3 to 6.4 percentage points). Andrews and colleagues concluded (by contrast with our study) that waning was greater for ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 and greater among older adults and those in a clinical risk group. Whereas those authors found continuing vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 up to 26 weeks after receipt of the second vaccine dose, we found rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to be similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated participants by that time. Most of the follow-up in our study was while the delta variant was dominant in England. Previous studies found vaccine effectiveness to be lower for the delta variant than the alpha variant,31827 and lower for the omicron variant than the delta variant.2829 Consistent with the findings of this study, infection in vaccinated people has been widespread since the omicron variant became dominant; an estimated 71% of people in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 22 April 2022.30 It will be important to extend the analyses reported in this study to examine longer term effectiveness of two dose vaccination, and waning effectiveness of booster vaccination, against the omicron variant.\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study Our study is based on whole population data analysed within the OpenSAFELY Trusted Research Environment, which has stringent disclosure controls to protect patients\u2019 privacy. The large study size and large numbers of outcome events led to precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness according to brand of vaccine and time since second vaccine dose. We accounted for risk dependent vaccine allocation by separating the cohort into subgroups based on JCVI group,31 and by doing analyses within strata defined by JCVI group, eligibility date for primary vaccination, and geographical region. We fully accounted for rapid changes in incidence of covid-19 with calendar time, because the risk sets underpinning the Cox models compared people being followed on the calendar day when outcome events occurred. Our analyses also excluded people with a pre-vaccine rollout record of SARS-CoV-2 infection and accounted for censoring due to occurrence of outcome events and attenuation of comparison groups because of receipt of first vaccine dose by unvaccinated people and third dose by fully vaccinated people. The OpenSAFELY platform contains an unprecedented scale of NHS records that are refreshed every week, and the methods used for data storage and management facilitate rapid re-execution of all curation and analysis code. This will enable us to regularly reassess waning vaccine effectiveness over extended time intervals, the impact of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the effects of further doses of covid-19 vaccines. Our study has several limitations. Firstly, as in any observational study, our estimates could be affected by confounding by unmeasured factors. The detailed linked data analysed permitted adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, but we may not have been able to control completely for the associations of being vaccinated with health seeking behaviours and being less socioeconomically deprived. Secondly, patients registered with a primary care practice who have moved or emigrated (or whose death was not recorded)32 may contribute person time but not events. Because the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups are defined by recent vaccination, these \u201cghost\u201d patients are more likely to be present in the unvaccinated group, leading to bias in estimates of waning. Also, healthcare workers could be identified and excluded from the vaccinated groups, because this information was recorded at the time of vaccination, but not from the unvaccinated group. This limitation should not affect results for the \u226565 subgroup, most of whom are retired, or comparisons between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. Thirdly, consistent with an Australian survey,33 we found that unvaccinated people had tested less frequently than vaccinated people during the pre-vaccine rollout period when widespread testing was available (table 1) and were considerably less likely to be tested during follow-up (supplementary table S7). Fourthly, differential depletion of susceptible people in the unvaccinated groups over time may lead to attenuation of hazard ratios even when true vaccine effectiveness does not change. However, such bias is likely to be minimal when vaccine effectiveness is high.34 Fifthly, we excluded people vaccinated outside defined \u201csecond vaccination periods\u201d and estimated hazard ratios within four week periods subsequent to second vaccination. Modelling non-linear interactions of vaccine effectiveness with time since vaccination is a potentially more powerful approach that could avoid excluding so many people but would rely on more complex modelling assumptions than those underpinning our analyses."

        "Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following covid-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review",
        "Conclusions These findings indicate that adolescent and young adult men are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Use of a Pfizer vaccine over a Moderna vaccine and waiting for more than 30 days between doses might be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 years is very rare but certainty was low. Data for clinical risk factors were very limited. A clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appeared to be benign, although longer term follow-up data were limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (eg, biopsy and tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism.\n\nResults 46 studies were included (14 on incidence, seven on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short term course, three on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines was highest in male adolescents and male young adults (age 12-17 years, range 50-139 cases per million (low certainty); 18-29 years, 28-147 per million (moderate certainty)). For girls and boys aged 5-11 years and women aged 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) could be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). Incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine had very low certainty evidence. For individuals of 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12-17, 18-29, or 18-39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine for covid-19 might be lower when administered \u226531 days compared with \u226430 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18-29 years indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to \u226556 days to substantially drop myocarditis or pericarditis incidence. For clinical course and short term outcomes, only one small case series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In adolescents and adults, most (>90%) myocarditis cases involved men of a median 20-30 years of age and with symptom onset two to four days after a second dose (71-100%). Most people were admitted to hospital (\u226584%) for a short duration (two to four days). For pericarditis, data were limited but more variation than myocarditis has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing, and rate of admission to hospital. Three case series with longer term (3 months; n=38) follow-up suggested persistent echocardiogram abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms or a need for drug treatments or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. Sixteen hypothesised mechanisms were described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence.\n\nEligibility criteria for selecting studies Large (>10 000 participants) or population based or multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination; case series (n\u22655, presentation, short term clinical course and longer term outcomes); opinions, letters, reviews, and primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesised mechanisms.\n\nData sources Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 6 October 2020 to 10 January 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to 13 January 2021). One reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine learning program to prioritise records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\n\nObjectives To synthesise evidence on incidence rates and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after use of mRNA vaccination against covid-19, clinical presentation, short term and longer term outcomes of cases, and proposed mechanisms.\n\nFinally, we asked what are the hypothesised mechanisms involved in myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA covid-19 vaccines, and do they vary by patient or vaccine characteristics?\n\nThe fourth question asked what the prognosis is in the longer term (\u22654 weeks) among individuals of a similar age and sex who had myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination, and does this vary by patient characteristics or vaccine?\n\nThirdly, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination, in children younger than 12 years, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? From our original review, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination (ie, across all ages and after a second vaccine dose)?\n\nSecondly, among individuals of a similar age and sex, what risk or protective factors exist for myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? Examples of factors include pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, pharmacotherapies (eg, hormones), type of vaccine product, length of vaccine dosing interval, and vaccine combinations for first v second v booster doses.\n\nWe asked five main questions for the review. Firstly, what is the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? We used data stratified by age and sex, in individuals aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, or 18-29 years after their second dose, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination.\n\nThis evidence synthesis included systematic reviews of incidence rates (in people aged 0-39 years) and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination, evidence reviews of initial presentation and clinical course and of longer term outcomes of cases, and a description of proposed mechanisms and their supporting evidence. We originally reviewed (in our literature search on 6 October 2021) incidence rates, risk factors, and case presentation and short term outcomes of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination across all vaccines, ages, and sexes. Our results indicated that incident rates were very low to none after non-mRNA vaccines and in adults aged 40 years and older, that rates after mRNA vaccination varied by sex, age, and dose, and that the case characteristics and clinical course of myocarditis and pericarditis differed. 15 At that time, no data were available for children aged <12 years or for people after receiving a third dose. For this review, we refined the questions to focus on gaps and priorities of the stakeholder or decision maker, specifically, mRNA vaccines, priority age and risk groups, and cases after a third vaccine dose. Where possible, we limited cases to those confirmed by medical record review and of myocarditis or myopericarditis, or pericarditis rather than in combination (when data were available separately). We also expanded the scope to include evidence on longer term outcomes. Finally, we added descriptions and studies of hypothesised mechanisms. This report focuses on the refined questions but also includes findings on characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after any dose of the vaccine across all ages from the original review.\n\nMyocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and pericarditis, an inflammatory disease of the pericardial sac, can occur in isolation, although some patients present with overlapping features. Viral causes are common for both disorders. Symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis typically include new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or a combination of these symptoms. 11 Diagnosis of a probable case of myocarditis usually requires elevated troponin concentrations or findings from imaging (eg, echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging) or other testing (eg, echocardiogram); histopathology for a definitive diagnosis is not usually done. 12 Differential diagnoses, including covid-19 infection or other viruses, should be considered and ruled out. 12 13 Most people with these conditions will fully recover. Myocarditis can lead to heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, whereas long term consequences associated with pericarditis include one or more recurrences and, rarely, thickening of the pericardium and constrictive heart filling. 14\n\nCase reports and surveillance signals 1 2 3 4 of myocarditis (including myopericarditis) and pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination appeared as early as April 2021, leading to the surveillance of adverse events of special interest after vaccination with mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). Estimated rates of myocarditis are 11 per 100 000 person years in the UK 5 and 1-2 cases per 100 000 person years in the US, 6 7 regardless of age. In the US, estimated background rates or expected rates after covid-19 vaccination of myocarditis is 0.2 per one million people and of pericarditis is 1.4 per one million people, after adjustment for a 7 day risk period where most cases appear. 6 Historically, myocarditis has been more prevalent in male than female individuals, from childhood through young adulthood, 8 and this tendency was reflected in early post-covid-19 vaccination case series. 9 10\n\nMethods\n\nWe developed a protocol before screening began and synthesis of evidence. Knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada contributed to scoping the reviews but did not participate in their conduct. We followed guidance for systematic reviews when conducting16 and reporting17 questions one and two. The reviews are now living and future updates will be posted on the COVID-END website at https://www.mcmasterforum.org/networks/covid-end.\n\nLiterature search We worked with an experienced medical information specialist to develop the search strategy, which was peer reviewed (see acknowledgments).18 Searches combined concepts for covid-19, vaccines, and myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiovascular manifestations, adverse events, surveillance; each concept included various keyword and medical subject heading terms. We originally searched on 6 October 2021 and updated the search on 10 January 2022; the updated search (appendix 1) was slightly modified from the original search (eg, adding omicron, removing non-mRNA vaccine terms). We did not add limits for language, country, or study design, but had limits to exclude case reports and news or newspaper articles. Using the multifile option as well as the de-duplication tool in Ovid, we searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and epub ahead of print, in-process, in-data-review and other non-indexed citations and daily from 1946 to 10 January 2022, inclusive, and Embase 1974 to 10 January 2022, inclusive. We searched grey literature by scanning 20 key national websites (eg, Public Health Agency of Canada, UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to identify unpublished data. On 13 January 2022, we searched L-OVE, CT.gov, Cochrane covid Reg, WHO Covid reg, and Google Scholar for additional grey literature. We scanned reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews and consulted our clinician authors (AM and IP) and an expert consultant (Bruce McManus; see acknowledgments) to identify potentially eligible studies on mechanisms. All studies and reports included in the original review were screened for eligibility for the revised questions in this update.\n\nEligibility criteria Our inclusion criteria are outlined in box 1. Studies could be eligible for more than one question. Box 1 Eligibility criteria for each question Population People of any age; data for questions one and two (Q1 and Q2) must be reported using age categories (eg, 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 18-29, 30-39, \u226540 years) and by dose. If incidence rates were very low and for question two on risk factors, we included data across sexes if no other study reported by sex.\n\nIncident rates after a second dose of vaccine in Q1 were intended to be limited to people younger than 30 years; because several studies reported on an 18-39-year-old category, we included these data, as well as that for people aged 30-39 years, in a post hoc manner. Intervention or exposure Q1: mRNA vaccines approved in Canada: BNT162b2 RNA/PfizerBioNTech/Comirnaty, mRNA-1273/Moderna Spikevax (alternative manufacturers of same vaccine are eligible), by type of vaccine and dose.\n\nQ2: Same as Q1, plus potential risk or protective factors: pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, length of vaccine dosing interval, type of vaccine, vaccine combination for first versus second versus booster doses.\n\nQ3-Q5: Confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination. For Q3, part 2, cases did not need to be confirmed.\n\nAt least one dose of the vaccine needed to be with an mRNA vaccine; one or more other doses might have been with a non-mRNA vaccine.\n\nFor Q3-Q5, we included exposure to myocarditis or pericarditis (combined) if no separate data were available. Control or comparator Q1: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but no longer at risk for outcome, previously vaccinated with other vaccines (ie, controlling for confounders associated with vaccine uptake), or unvaccinated people; or no comparator.\n\nQ2: People vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but without the risk or protective factor. Might be a different type of mRNA vaccine, interval between doses, or mixture of vaccines for different doses.\n\nQ3: No comparator.\n\nQ4: No comparator but will include data for any comparisons with people vaccinated and no myocarditis or pericarditis.\n\nQ5: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine who did not have myocarditis or pericarditis; or no comparator. Outcome Q1: Incidence rate or cumulative risk of confirmed myocarditis (including myopericarditis) or pericarditis by dose. Effect measures: incidence rate or cumulative risk (might be risk difference if accounting for background rate in control group).

RETURN TO TEXT\n\nStudy selection All reviewers JP, LH, LB, LG, and AW undertaking screening conducted a pilot round in Excel using 300 records. We then conducted screening in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners) using structured forms. For title and abstract review, we applied the machine learning program Daisy AI, which continually reprioritises records during screening.19 Records were divided among reviewers with one reviewer screening titles and abstracts and another reviewer verifying exclusions for the first 50% of records. For full text selection, one reviewer reviewed all records, and a second reviewer verified all exclusions. Studies were further verified for inclusion during data extraction. For question three part 2, we mapped the case series by country and data source to identify the most recent and comprehensive data source for each geographical region (ie, US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Israel). For regions with multiple reports, we prioritised data that were most recent, most comprehensive (largest numbers), and based on confirmed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. We aimed to avoid overlap in data (ie, the same cases reported in different sources). However, we did include sources that reported on specific subgroups (eg, 12-17 year olds) to present more details on these groups of interest. We have noted in the tables where overlap might be present in cases between reports and we avoided aggregating events and counts across studies.\n\nData extraction We extracted all data into a structured format in Microsoft Word and conducted a pilot exercise with two studies for each question. Thereafter, one reviewer extracted data and another verified study eligibility and all data. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead (JP or LH). For question one, we extracted data that related to all elements of the eligibility criteria (box 1) and data used for risk of bias assessment. We focused on methods for identifying cases (ie, passive surveillance versus active surveillance or registry data), outcome ascertainment and confirmation or adjudication (including criteria for case definitions and classification), as well as the dosing interval and risk interval for which the events were captured. We preferred estimates of incidence compared with an unexposed group (ie, excess incidence or risk differences) over those without a control. For question two, we extracted data as for question one, along with associations or subgroup analyses based on pre-existing conditions, different vaccine types or products, dosing interval, and combinations of vaccines. We extracted rates in each group and (if reported) the relative effects between groups (eg, incidence rate ratio and odds ratios), adjusted for key confounders (ie, infection status, cardiac and immunodeficiency or autoimmune conditions) when reported. For questions three and four, we based data extraction on the evidence table presented in an existing review9 because these findings covered most of the items specified under our outcomes in box 1. We added the following items: criteria for confirmation of cases, breakdown of cases by diagnosis (myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis), data source, age included, percentage of patients with pre-existing conditions, percentage of patients admitted to an intensive care unit, percentage of patients admitted to hospital, and number of fatalities. For question four, we also added longer term investigations and outcomes. For question five, we extracted verbatim authors\u2019 summaries of any hypotheses and, where available, findings by the authors or cited works investigating potential mechanisms (eg, histology, gene panels, serology for innate and acquired immune system components, autoimmune antibodies, tissue biopsies, autopsy findings, etc). We checked references used to support statements made by authors in proposing or explaining hypotheses to identify whether they provided direct empirical evidence (ie, specific to covid-19 mRNA vaccination). Three content experts (AM, IP, BM) reviewed proposed mechanisms for comprehensiveness and interpretation.\n\nRisk of bias assessment For questions one and two, all reviewers involved in the risk of bias assessments (JP, LB, LG, and AW) piloted the risk of bias tool with two papers. We used the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) checklist for cohort studies,20 with modifications mainly to ascertain valid risk factor measurement (appendix 2). We focused on valid and reliable case finding and confirmation, and, for question two, accounting for key confounders. Assessments were completed by one reviewer and verified by another. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead. For questions three and four, we did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The intent of these questions was to characterise patients and their clinical course, rather than providing quantitative estimates, for example, of incidence. In this case, we judged the main risk of bias to come from case ascertainment: whether each report includes only cases confirmed or verified by clinicians. To deal with this potential bias, we limited inclusion to confirmed cases (question three part 1 and question four) or extracted this information and considered its potential effect when summarising the results (question three part 2).\n\nData synthesis and certainty assessments For question one, we did not pool results due to heterogeneity in case finding (passive v active surveillance), dosing and risk intervals, age groupings, and, in some cases, some degree of overlap in cases expected between studies. We tabulated all results and compared and contrasted findings between studies based on the major differentiating population, vaccine, and methodological variables. We report the range in incidence rates across studies, or, when all rates are low, concluded that the incidence is fewer than 20 cases per million, which, based on our clinical investigator input, we considered very rare. Based on input from clinicians and our knowledge users from Public Health Agency of Canada, we developed the key age categories (0-4, 5-11, 12-17, and 18-29 years) to rely on when possible. If a study contributed more than one result within these (eg, 20-24 and 25-29, results for each mRNA vaccine) we calculated a weighted average (eg, by proportion of years in the age range) of the incident rates. When a study reported an incidence rate (or data to calculate this) and an incidence rate ratio compared with a control or background rate, but not the difference in incidence (excess incidence over background rate), we calculated the excess incidence (ie, crude incidence \u2212 (crude incidence/ incidence rate ratio)). We assessed the certainty for each of our conclusion statements using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance.212223 We did not apply a threshold for an important incidence rate, but in general, we considered fewer than 20 cases per million doses to be very rare. For question two, associations (odds ratio or relative risk) of 1.5 or more were considered clinically relevant (ie, odds ratio <1.5 shows little-to-no association). Observational studies for incident rates (question one) started at low certainty (ie, our confidence in the incident rate is limited; the true rate might be substantially different from the estimate) and studies on risk factors (question two) started at high certainty21 (ie, we are very confident that the true difference in rate between risk groups lies close to the estimate). We rated down for serious concerns about risk of bias, inconsistency or absence of consistency (single study), indirectness, imprecision, or reporting biases. We rated down for risk of bias when only studies having high risk for case ascertainment contributed to an outcome (eg, passive surveillance where we assume there is under-ascertainment). We also rated down for indirectness for comparisons across both sexes or if the age group reported did not match one of our groups of interest (eg, 13-39 year olds) and the incident rates could vary substantially among ages. We rated down for imprecision in groups with fewer people than would be expected for one event to occur based on estimated baseline incidence rates (eg, a subgroup with 8000 people but reporting zero events). We considered uprating when incidence rates were large (eg, twice or more than our 20 per million threshold) when no other major limitations were evident and we had moderate confidence in our conclusion, often reported as a range of incidences.24 In our conclusions, we have used the terms probably, might, and uncertain to reflect, respectively, moderate, low, or very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE. When we have very low certainty, we made no conclusions about specific incident rates or other outcomes. For questions three and four, we present the details for each case series in an evidence table and provide a descriptive summary. For question five, we present a summary of the mechanisms and a more descriptive table."

        "Clinical prediction models for mortality in patients with covid-19: external validation and individual participant data meta-analysis",
        "Conclusion The prognostic value of the included models varied greatly between the data sources. Although the Knight 4C Mortality Score and Wang clinical model appeared most promising, recalibration (intercept and slope updates) is needed before implementation in routine care.\n\nResults Datasets included 27 clusters from 18 different countries and contained data on 46 914patients. The pooled estimates ranged from 0.67 to 0.80 (C statistic), 0.22 to 1.22 (calibration slope), and 0.18 to 2.59 (O:E ratio) and were prone to substantial between study heterogeneity. The 4C Mortality Score by Knight et al (pooled C statistic 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.84, 95% prediction interval 0.72 to 0.86) and clinical model by Wang et al (0.77, 0.73 to 0.80, 0.63 to 0.87) had the highest discriminative ability. On average, 29% fewer deaths were observed than predicted by the 4C Mortality Score (pooled O:E 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.11, 95% prediction interval 0.21 to 2.39), 35% fewer than predicted by the Wang clinical model (0.65, 0.52 to 0.82, 0.23 to 1.89), and 4% fewer than predicted by Xie et al\u2019s model (0.96, 0.59 to 1.55, 0.21 to 4.28).\n\nMethods Eight prognostic models with diverse predictors were identified and validated. A two stage individual participant data meta-analysis was performed of the estimated model concordance (C) statistic, calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large, and observed to expected ratio (O:E) across the included clusters.\n\nModel selection and eligibility criteria Prognostic models identified by the living systematic review and through contacting experts. A priori models were excluded that had a high risk of bias in the participant domain of PROBAST (prediction model study risk of bias assessment tool) or for which the applicability was deemed poor.\n\nDespite many ongoing efforts to develop covid-19 related prediction models, evidence on their performance when validated in external cohorts or countries is largely unknown. Prediction models often perform worse than anticipated and are prone to poor calibration when applied to new individuals. 6 7 8 Clinical implementation of poorly performing models leads to incorrect predictions and could lead to unnecessary interventions, or to the withholding of important interventions. Both result in potential harm to patients and inappropriate use of medical resources. Therefore, prediction models should always be externally validated before clinical implementation. 9 These validation studies are performed to quantify the performance of a prediction model across different settings and populations and can thus be used to identify the potential usefulness and effectiveness of these models for medical decision making. 7 8 10 11 12 We performed a large scale international individual participant data meta-analysis to externally validate the most promising prognostic models for predicting short term mortality in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 is a clinically heterogeneous disease of varying severity and prognosis. 3 Risk stratification tools have been developed to target prevention and management or treatment strategies, or both, for people at highest risk of a poor outcome. 4 Risk stratification can be improved by the estimation of the absolute risk of unfavourable outcomes in individual patients. This involves the implementation of prediction models that combine information from multiple variables (predictors). Predicting the risk of mortality with covid-19 could help to identify those patients who require the most urgent help or those who would benefit most from treatment. This would facilitate the efficient use of limited medical resources, and reduce the impact on the healthcare system\u2014especially intensive care units. Furthermore, if a patient\u2019s risk of a poor outcome is known at hospital admission, predicting the risk of mortality could help with planning the use of scarce resources. In a living systematic review (update 3, 12 January 2021; www.covprecise.org ), 39 prognostic models for predicting short term (mostly in-hospital) mortality in patients with a diagnosis of covid-19 have been identified. 5\n\nCovid-19 has had a major impact on global health and continues to disrupt healthcare systems and social life. Millions of deaths have been reported worldwide since the start of the pandemic in 2019. 1 Although vaccines are now widely deployed, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the burden of covid-19 remain extremely high. Many countries do not have adequate resources to effectively implement vaccination strategies. Also, the timing and sequence of vaccination schedules are still debatable, and virus mutations could yet hamper the future effectiveness of vaccines. 2\n\nPatients and members of the public were not directly involved in this research owing to lack of funding, staff, and infrastructure to facilitate their involvement. Several authors were directly involved in the treatment of patients with covid-19, have been in contact with hospital patients with covid-19, or have had covid-19.\n\nNone of the datasets contained all predictors, meaning the models could not all be validated in a single dataset, which hampered the interpretation. As such, for each performance measure taken separately, we performed a meta-regression on all performance estimates where we included country (not cluster, to save degrees of freedom) and model as predictors (both as dummy variables), which we had not prespecified in our protocol. Then we used these meta-models to predict the performance (and 95% confidence intervals) of each prediction model in each included country, thereby allowing for a fairer comparison of the performance between models. All R code is available from github.com/VMTdeJong/COVID-19_Prognosis_IPDMA .\n\nIn the second stage of the meta-analysis, we pooled the cluster specific logit C statistic, calibration slope, and log O:E ratios from stage 1. 22 We used restricted maximum likelihood estimation and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method to derive all confidence intervals. 23 24 To quantify the presence of between study heterogeneity, we constructed approximate 95% prediction intervals, which indicated probable ranges of performance expected in new clusters. 25 We performed the analysis in R (version 4.0.0 or later, using packages mice, pROC, and metamisc) and we repeated the main analyses in STATA. 26 27 28 29 30 This study is reported following the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist for prediction model validation (see supplementary material C). 31 32\n\nWe imputed sporadically missing data 50 times by applying multiple imputation (see supplementary material B). Using each of the eight models, we calculated the mortality risk or mortality score of all participants, in clusters where the respective models\u2019 predictors were measured in at least some of the participants. Subsequently, we calculated the concordance (C) statistic, observed to expected ratio (O:E ratio), calibration slope, and calibration-in-the-large for each model in each imputed cluster. 11 The C statistic is an estimator for the probability of correctly identifying the patient with the outcome in a pair of randomly selected patients of which one has developed the outcome and one has not. 20 The O:E ratio is the ratio of the number of observed outcomes divided by the number of outcomes expected by the prediction model. The calibration slope is an estimator of the correction factor the prediction model coefficients need to be multiplied with, to obtain coefficients that are well calibrated to the validation sample. 11 21 The calibration-in-the-large is an estimator for the (additive) correction to the prediction model\u2019s intercept, while keeping the prediction model\u2019s coefficients fixed. 11 21 Supplementary material B provides details of the model equations.\n\nFor external validation and meta-analysis we used a two stage process. 15 16 The first stage consisted of imputing missing data and estimating performance metrics in individual clusters. For datasets that included only one hospital (or cohort) we defined the cluster level as the individual hospital (or cohort). In the CAPACITY-COVID dataset, 17 which contains data from multiple countries, we considered each country as a cluster. For the data from UnityPoint Hospitals in Iowa, United States, we considered each hospital as a cluster. We use the term cluster throughout the paper. In the second stage we performed a meta-analysis of the performance metrics. 18 19 We did not perform an a priori sample size calculation, as we included all data that we found through the review and that met the inclusion criteria.\n\nData sources were eligible for model validation if they contained data on mortality endpoints for consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. We included only patients with a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded patients with no laboratory data recorded in the first 24 hours of admission. In each data source, we adopted the same eligibility criteria for all models that we selected for validation. We used 30 days for the scoring rule by Bello-Chavolla et al 14 when available, otherwise in-hospital mortality was used (see table 1).\n\nWe searched for individual studies and registries containing data from routine clinical care (electronic healthcare records), and data sharing platforms with individual patient data of those admitted to hospital with covid-19. We further identified eligible data sources through the second update (21 July 2020) of the living systematic review. 5 13 In addition, we consulted the PROSPERO database, references of published prediction models for covid-19, and experts in prognosis research and infectious diseases.\n\nWe considered prediction models to be eligible for the current meta-analysis if they were developed using data from patients who were admitted to a hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In papers that reported multiple prognostic models, we considered each model for eligibility. As all the prognostic models for covid-19 mortality in the second update (21 July 2020) of the living systematic review had a lower quality and high risk of bias in at least one domain of PROBAST (prediction model study risk of bias assessment tool), 7 8 we only excluded models that had a high risk of bias for the participant domain and models for which applicability was deemed poor, as well as imaging based algorithms (see fig 1 ).\n\nWe used the second update (21 July 2020) of an existing living systematic review of prediction models for covid-19 to identify multivariable prognostic models and scoring rules for assessing short term (at 30 days or in-hospital) mortality in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. 5 During the third update of the living review (12 January 2021), 13 additional models were found that also met the study eligibility criteria of this individual participant data meta-analysis, which we also included for external validation.\n\nThe results for the predicted O:E ratio were less straightforward, as the predicted values for each model except the Wang laboratory model (see supplementary table S12) were greater than 1 in some countries and smaller than 1 in other countries. Similarly, this was the case for the predicted values of the calibration slopes for all models (see supplementary table S13). This implied that none of the included models were well calibrated to the data from all included countries. Supplementary table S14 shows the predicted calibration-in-the-large estimates.\n\nIn the meta-regression, where all performance estimates were regressed on the country and the prediction model, the point estimate of the discrimination was the highest for the 4C Mortality Score (reference) and lowest for the Wang laboratory model. Country wise, the point estimate was highest in Israel and lowest in Mexico (see supplementary material D for point estimates and supplementary table S11 for predicted C statistics for each country).\n\nSupplementary material D figures S3 and S4 show the forest plots for all calibration slopes. The estimate for the calibration slope was the closest to 1 for the 4C Mortality Score (1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.52, 95% prediction interval 0.63 to 1.80). The Wang clinical model had a calibration slope of 0.50 (0.44 to 0.56, 95% prediction interval 0.34 to 0.66). The calibration slope for the Xie model was 0.45 (0.27 to 0.63, 95% prediction interval \u22120.07 to 0.96) and for the Hu model was 0.32 (0.15 to 0.49, 95% prediction interval \u22120.34 to 0.98). Supplementary material D presents details of the remaining models that were estimated.\n\nPooled observed to expected ratio estimates with corresponding 95% confidence interval and approximate 95% prediction interval for four models. Estimates are presented on the log scale. See supplementary file for full data. UCLH=University College London; DGAE=General Directorate of Epidemiology; KCH=King\u2019s College Hospital\n\nThe O:E ratio of the Xie model was the closest to 1, with a meta-analysis summary estimate of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.55, 95% prediction interval 0.21 to 4.28, fig 4 ), indicating on average the number of predicted deaths was in agreement with the number of observed deaths. However, the relatively wide 95% confidence interval and 95% prediction interval indicate some heterogeneity. The 4C Mortality Score attained an O:E ratio of 0.71 (0.45 to 1.11, 95% prediction interval 0.21 to 2.39, fig 4 ). The Hu model attained an O:E ratio of 0.61 (0.42 to 0.87, 95% prediction interval 0.15 to 2.48, fig 4 ). The Wang clinical model attained an O:E ratio of 0.65 (0.52 to 0.82, 95% prediction interval 0.23 to 1.89, fig 4 ). Supplementary figure S2 shows the O:E ratios of the other models and supplementary table S10 the calibration-in-the-large values.\n\nPooled C statistic estimates with corresponding 95% confidence interval and approximate 95% prediction intervals for four models (see supplementary file for full data). The Knight et al 4C Mortality Score had a C statistic of 0.786 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79) in the development data and 0.767 (0.76 to 0.77) in the validation data in the original publication. The Wang et al clinical model had a C statistic of 0.88 (0.80 to 0.95) in the development data and 0.83 (0.68 to 0.93) in the validation data in the original publication. The Xie et al model had a C statistic of 0.89 (0.86 to 0.93) in the development data, 0.88 after optimism correction, and 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) in the validation data in the original publication. The Hu et al model had a C statistic of 0.90 in the development data and 0.88 in the validation data in the original publication. UCLH=University College London; DGAE=General Directorate of Epidemiology; KCH=King\u2019s College Hospital\n\nThe 4C Mortality Score showed the highest discrimination, with a pooled C statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.84, fig 3 and see supplementary fig S4). The heterogeneity of discrimination of this model across datasets (95% prediction interval 0.72 to 0.86) was low compared with that of the other models. The next best discriminating model was the Wang clinical model, with a pooled C statistic of 0.77 (0.73 to 0.80, fig 3 ), and a greater heterogeneity (95% prediction interval 0.63 to 0.87). Two other models attained a summary C statistic >0.70: the Xie model with a C statistic of 0.75 (0.68 to 0.80, 95% prediction interval 0.58 to 0.86, fig 3 ), and the Hu model with a C statistic of 0.74 (0.66 to 0.80, 95% prediction interval 0.41 to 0.92, fig 3 ). The summary C statistic estimates for the remaining models were <0.70 (see supplementary fig S1).\n\nAll results are presented in supplementary material D. The Wang clinical model could be validated in 24 clusters (see supplementary table S2), followed by Hu et al\u2019s model, which was validated in 16 clusters (see supplementary table S3). The remaining models were less often validated, as predictor measurements were available in fewer datasets: the Bello-Chavolla score was validated in seven clusters (see supplementary table S4), the model by Xie et al in nine clusters (see supplementary table S5), the DCS model by Zhang et al in six clusters (see supplementary table S6), the DCSL model by Zhang et al in six clusters (see supplementary table S7), the 4C Mortality Score in six clusters (see supplementary table S8), and the Wang laboratory model in three clusters (see supplementary table S9).\n\nWe identified 10 data sources, including four through living systematic reviews, one through a data sharing platform, and five by experts in the specialty ( fig 2 ). The obtained datasets included 27 clusters from 18 different countries and contained data on 46 701 patients, 16 418 of whom died ( table 2 ). Study recruitment was between November 2019 and April 2021. Most clusters included all patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19, although in some clusters only patients admitted through a specific department were included (see supplementary material A, table S1). Mean age ranged from 45 to 71 years.\n\nAlthough the 4C Mortality Score itself does not provide absolute risks, these were available through an online calculator. As the authors promoted the use of the online calculator, we have used these risks in our analysis. For two models by Wang et al (clinical and laboratory), no intercept was available and were approximated. 38\n\nThe six prognostic models were estimated by logistic regression. The Bello-Chavolla score and Knight et al 4C Mortality Score were (simplified) scoring rules that could be used to stratify patients into risk groups. The Bello-Chavolla score was developed with Cox regression, whereas the 4C Mortality Score was developed with lasso logistic regression and its weights were rescaled and rounded to integer values.\n\nWe identified six prognostic models and two scoring rules that met the inclusion criteria ( fig 1 ). Table 1 summarises the details of the models and scores. The score developed by Bello-Chavolla et al predicted 30 day mortality, 14 whereas the other score and the six models predicted in-hospital mortality. 33 34 35 36 37\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our individual participant data meta-analysis we found that previously identified prediction models varied in their ability to discriminate between those patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who will die and those who will survive. The 4C Mortality Score, the Wang clinical model, and the Xie model achieved the highest discrimination on average in our study and could therefore serve as starting points for implementation in clinical practice. The 4C Mortality Score could only be validated in six clusters, which might indicate limited usefulness in clinical practice. Whereas the discrimination of both Wang models and the Xie model was lower than in their respective development studies, the discrimination of the 4C Mortality Score was similar to the estimates in its development study.\n\nAlthough the summary estimates of discrimination performance are rather precise owing to the large number of included patients, some are prone to substantial between cluster heterogeneity. Discrimination varied greatly across hospitals and countries for all models, but least for the 4C Mortality Score. For some models the 95% prediction interval of the C statistic included 0.5, which implies that in some countries these models might not be able to discriminate between patients with covid-19 who survive or die during hospital admission.\n\nAll models were prone to calibration issues. Most models tended to over-predict mortality on average, meaning that the actual death count was lower than predicted. The Xie model achieved O:E ratios closest to 1, but this model\u2019s predicted risks were often too extreme: too high for high risk patients and too low for low risk patients, as quantified by the calibration slope, which was less than 1. The calibration slope was closest to 1 for the 4C Mortality Score, and this was the only model for which the 95% confidence interval included 1. All other summary calibration slopes were less than 1. This could be due to overfitting in the model development process. All the models were prone to substantial between cluster heterogeneity. This implies that local revisions (such as country specific or even centre specific intercepts) are likely necessary to ensure that risk predictions are sufficiently accurate.\n\nImplementing existing covid-19 models in routine care is challenging because the evolution and management of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences of changes to the virus over time and across geographical areas. In addition, the studied models were developed and validated using data collected during periods of the pandemic, and general practice might have subsequently changed. As a result, baseline risk estimates of existing prediction models (eg, the intercept term) might have less generalisability than anticipated and might require regular updating, as shown in this meta-analysis. As predictor effects might also change over time or geographical region, a subsequent step might be to update these as well.40 Since most data originate from electronic health record databases, hospital registries offer a promising source for dynamic updating of covid-19 related prediction models.414243 As data from new individuals become available, the prognostic models should be updated, as well as their performance in external validation sets.414243\n\nLimitations of this meta-analysis All the models we considered were developed and validated using data from the first waves of the covid-19 pandemic, up to April 2021, mostly before vaccination was implemented widely. Since the gathering of data, treatments for patients with covid-19 have improved and new options have been introduced. These changes are likely to reduce the overall risk of short term mortality in patients with covid-19. Prediction models for covid-19 for which adequate calibration has previously been established may therefore still yield inaccurate predictions in contemporary clinical practice. This further highlights the need for continual validation and updates.43 An additional concern is that prediction models are typically used to decide on treatment strategies but do not indicate to what extent patients benefit from individualised treatment decisions. Although patients at high risk of death could be prioritised for receiving intensive care, it would be more practical to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from such care. This individualised approach towards patient management requires models to predict (counterfactual) patient outcomes for all relevant treatment strategies, which is not straightforward.4445 These predictions of patients\u2019 absolute risk reduction require estimation of the patients\u2019 short term risk of mortality with and without treatment, which might require the estimation of treatment effects that differ by patient.45 As variants of the disease emerge, new treatments are developed, and the disease is better managed, predictor effects and the incidence of mortality due to covid-19 may vary, thereby potentially limiting the predictive performance of the models we investigated. We only considered models for predicting mortality in patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, as outcomes such as clinical deterioration might increase the risk of heterogeneity from variation in measurements and differences in definitions. Mortality, however, is commonly recorded in electronic healthcare systems, with limited risk for misclassification. Furthermore, it is an important outcome that is often considered in decision making. We had to use the reported nomograms to recover the intercepts for two prediction models from one group.3132 Ideally, authors would have adhered to the TRIPOD guidelines, which would have facilitated the evaluation of their models."

        "Rapid covid-19 vaccination for health workers",
        "Aodh\u00e1n S Breathnach , consultant medical microbiologist Infection Care Group, St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK aodhan.breathnach{at}stgeorges.nhs.uk\n\nInfection risk increased with every day of delay\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic led to a global scientific effort to understand and control this new disease. The most obvious result was the rapid development of several vaccines,12 in addition to other impressive exercises in collaborative epidemiological research such as the SIREN study (SARS-CoV2 immunity and reinfection evaluation) in the UK,3 the latest article of which has been published in The BMJ.4\n\nEarly in 2020, researchers realised that healthcare workers were an ideal discrete study cohort: frequent testing at workplaces was feasible; and many would be highly motivated to participate in the research of a disease with such a serious impact on society. As a result, a UK wide collaboration was established, led by Public Health England (now the UK Health Security Agency); partners included the public health agencies of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In the first year (June 2020 to June 2021), 135 NHS sites participated, and 87 continued into the second year.\n\nSIREN\u2019s methods were simple.5 Most NHS workers were eligible and 44 549 joined in the first year. Participants completed fortnightly questionnaires detailing possible exposures to SARS-CoV-2, any symptoms, and whether they had been vaccinated; they also had polymerase chain reaction tests every fortnight for SARS-CoV-2, and serum antibody tests every month. Overall, 2353 (12.9%) susceptible participants were infected during the second wave between September 2020 and April 2021, which was the study period of this latest paper by Pople and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070379).4 Staff working in emergency departments or ward settings, healthcare assistants, and anyone with frequent exposure to patients had significantly increased odds of infection.\n\nAn earlier paper from SIREN6 described the protective effect of covid vaccination in healthcare workers, with 85% protection after two doses during a relatively short follow-up until 5 February 2021. Pople and colleagues build on that earlier work, with a more detailed analysis of the rapid deployment of the UK vaccination programme in the NHS, which officially began on 8 December 2020.4 The authors included SIREN participants in England who were susceptible to covid-19 at the start of the second wave, and tracked their progress (principally vaccination, exposures and infection) until 30 April 2021; by then the second wave had subsided, and nearly all participants were vaccinated. The paper presents a mathematical epidemiological model, simulating a scenario in which nobody was vaccinated\u2014enabling a theoretical estimate of the number of infections that were prevented by the vaccine rollout among healthcare workers.\n\nThe results confirm previous findings on occupational risk.7 They also confirmed the protective effective of vaccination, but in addition showed that each day\u2019s delay in vaccination measurably increased the risk, multiplying a participant\u2019s adjusted odds of infection by 1.02.\n\nAlthough 90% of SIREN participants received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the findings are likely to apply equally to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the other principal vaccine used in the UK: both appear to have similar efficacy (as shown in another study in The BMJ, doi:10.1136/bmj-2021-068946).8 What is more novel in the study by Pople and colleagues is the detailed modelling of this protection: the authors conclude that infection rates in patient facing healthcare workers would have been 69% higher without vaccination.4 This proportion would have greatly worsened the considerable staff shortages that were seen in the NHS and other health services at the time.9\n\nPople and colleagues\u2019 paper is important for several reasons. It shows the value of a rapid vaccine deployment, prioritising healthcare workers, even during a surge in hospital (as well as community) infections that might feel overwhelming at the time. Weeks or even days made a substantial difference to infection rates, and therefore staff absences and patient safety. The authors also emphasise that any such vaccine deployment needs to be equitable across different occupational and ethnic groups of healthcare workers.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings remind us that some categories of staff remain at higher risk of occupational covid-19 (and presumably other respiratory infections), despite using personal protective equipment as advised at the time\u2014raising the question of whether vaccines and immunity are a good enough defence, or whether more stringent measures such as better personal protective equipment and ventilation are still required in high risk healthcare settings.10\n\nCertainly, things are very different now compared to early 2021; SARS-CoV-2 infection remains common despite vaccination, but causes much less harm (morbidity and mortality).1112 The NHS now faces a dilemma\u2014it is unclear what living with covid-1913 means in a healthcare setting, and whether we should now tolerate spread of a much milder infection in our hospitals. Further surveillance and research will help inform this debate, but ethical and political considerations are also likely to play a part.\n\nThe SIREN study also reminds us that other less well scrutinised respiratory viruses such as influenza, adenovirus, and other seasonal coronaviruses are likely to spread in the same fashion among staff in healthcare settings every winter\u2014something we have always known but chose to ignore.14 To suggest that the scope of SIREN could be extended to include other respiratory viruses is tempting, but a switch to anonymised or delayed testing would be needed unless clear protocols are developed for managing the many positive results and multiple viral infections likely to be detected.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

        "David Oliver: My personal pandemic experience is just one of many",
        "David Oliver , consultant in geriatrics and acute general medicine Berkshire davidoliver372{at}googlemail.com\n\nFollow David on Twitter @mancunianmedic\n\nI rarely write about my personal experiences, but practising medicine during the covid pandemic has finally given me the motivation. I\u2019m just one of hundreds of thousands of clinical and care staff who have lived through it all, and my story is no more important than anyone else\u2019s. But I\u2019d still like to tell it.\n\nI came into the pandemic already tired from three decades as an NHS doctor working on big, busy hospital wards and the acute medical take, combining it all with many external national roles. Ideally, I wanted a break from medicine. I\u2019d seen the reports from China, northern Italy, and the US about the impact of covid. By February 2020\u2014when the chief executive of NHS England, the health secretary, and the chief medical officer were fielding stories from the press\u2014I could see the writing on the wall, despite politicians\u2019 desire to play down the scale of the threat and to spread reassurance.\n\nBy early March I\u2019d looked after my first patient to die from the virus, at a time when covid tests were still hard to obtain. Over the next four months I was a consultant for a designated acute \u201chot\u201d covid ward, where all 28 patients were infected. I was also covering \u201chot\u201d areas in escalation wards, the emergency department, and the acute medical unit when on call.\n\nIn those early days we had no vaccine, little evidence about effective treatments, and very variable personal protective equipment (PPE), with confusing and inconsistent advice about its specification. People I worked with were coming to work every day at personal risk and with varying levels of anxiety, not just for themselves but for their partners. I seemed almost blas\u00e9 about personal risk at the time and enjoyed feeling more useful than at any time since I was a medical registrar\u2014but my wife was worried every day, knowing that I\u2019d be more interested in trying to speak to deaf or confused or anxious patients at close hand than worrying about personal protection.\n\nDaily impact I lost close NHS colleagues and friends to covid, watched many more become sick from it, and saw the daily impact of covid care on the nurses, healthcare assistants, allied health professionals, and young doctors I worked alongside. Some of their anxiety was about personal risk, but much of it was due to the relentless distress we were dealing with. Covid medicine affected the training experiences of doctors starting their careers. In debriefings with them and other staff members, it became clear that the wider covid restrictions in society and concerns about infecting friends and family left them with few release valves to help their wellbeing. Most inpatients with covid were not in intensive care but on general wards. With only flimsy PPE, we saw patients in their dozens with prolonged respiratory distress, high oxygen requirements, and other complications such as delirium or severe weakness. They were clinging to life or requiring palliative care. There are always some dying or deteriorating patients on general wards, but it\u2019s different when they\u2019re the majority. Because of visiting and travel restrictions we had to spend hours on the phone having awful conversations with patients\u2019 distressed family members, breaking bad news or explaining that their loved one was sick enough to die. In usual times, such encounters would have been face to face. One Saturday five of my patients died within 90 minutes, and we had to speak to all of their families by phone. During the second major wave from December 2020 to April 2021, the peak number of patients in hospital was twice as high as in the first wave, rising exponentially and rapidly that January. For the second time I was a consultant for a 28 bed \u201call covid\u201d ward, for five months. This time we at least had vaccines, a range of evidence based treatments, and a much better understanding of how to manage patients. But the same pressures and personal risks affected a staff team who were already tired. And isolation rules meant that patients were constantly being moved on and off the ward, depending on whether they\u2019d just tested positive or gone 10 days beyond a positive test. It\u2019s hard to provide any continuity of care in those circumstances\u2014and families were increasingly upset and sometimes hostile about the visiting restrictions.\n\nUnsung heroes In the spring 2022 wave I was once again the senior doctor on a designated covid ward. By this stage, anyone who tested positive was moved or admitted to my ward and then, if still an inpatient, moved off again within five days. This meant a frantic churn of patients. Throughout the pandemic response operational and clinical managers have been unsung heroes, doing what they could to flex admission routes, bed bases, ward configurations, and staff roles. They did the best they could in uncertain circumstances, as decisions on patient moves and flow affected clinical staff coping with constant change. However, the repeated failings on PPE provision, staff testing, confused policies and communications for clinicians, and suppression of staff\u2019s concerns are things I find hard to forgive. After two years of dodging the bullet I then caught covid myself in March, and, while not sick enough to be admitted, I haven\u2019t been right since. Some of my symptoms have doubtless been covid related, but others were due to burnout, anxiety, and depression\u2014eventually leading to my being signed off work sick in mid-May, unsure when I can return to clinical work. Having been elected as president of the Royal College of Physicians in April, I reluctantly and with great sadness had to withdraw from the role last week, as I no longer felt able to do it justice. If this has happened to me\u2014a veteran, stress tempered NHS doctor, 33 years in the job, with no long term conditions and previously fairly robust\u2014then few of us are likely to be exempt from the strains of the past couple of years. The NHS is now battling such a major backlog of cancelled elective procedures and relentless pressure on urgent care that this week every ambulance trust declared a major emergency. The service faces huge recruitment and retention issues, staffing gaps, social care pressures, and health inequalities, further adding to the strife. The timing\u2014where so many staff find themselves tired, burnt out, demoralised, or unwell\u2014could not be worse. A George Cross won\u2019t compensate for this, and the mood music created by intransigence on terms and conditions won\u2019t help. Without sufficient clinical and care staff, in sufficiently good health, and with sufficient support, energy, and morale, there will soon be no viable NHS or social care system."

        "Frail older people and those in deprived areas remain at risk from covid-19, even after vaccination",
        "Helen Saul , editor in chief 1, Deniz Gursul , research dissemination manager 1, Michela Antonelli , senior research fellow 2, Claire Steves , clinical senior lecturer 3 1NIHR Centre for Engagement and Dissemination, Twickenham, UK 2School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, UK 3Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King\u2019s College London, UK Correspondence to H Saul NIHRAlerts{at}nihr.ac.uk\n\nThe study Antonelli M, Penfold RS, Merino J, et al. Risk factors and disease profile of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app: a prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study. Lancet Infect Dis 2022;22:1. To read the full NIHR Alert, go to: https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/older-people-at-risk-from-covid-even-after-vaccine/\n\nWhy was the study needed? Before covid-19 vaccines became available, it was known that some groups faced higher risks from infection: healthcare professionals, people living in deprived areas, older people, and those who are frail or had other long term conditions. Little was known about whether the vaccine would prevent infections, or whether it would reduce the severity of illness. The COVID-19 Symptom Study is an ongoing online programme in which adults log their daily symptoms (or lack of them) using a mobile app. The app launched in March 2020 and millions of people signed up. Those who report symptoms are asked to take a test for SARS-CoV-2 and report the results. Since the vaccination programme started, people also record their vaccines. This study, based on data in the app, was set up to monitor infection rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the UK.\n\nWhat did the study do? Researchers looked at reports logged between December 2020 (when the vaccination programme began), and July 2021, when most adults had received at least one dose. Many older adults had received a second dose by then. App users provide information on their age, health status, and geographical area. In this study, people were defined as \u201cfrail\u201d if they scored above a certain level on a standard questionnaire that asks if they need help with everyday activities, or have to limit their activities because of their health. The study sought to find out which groups of people are most likely to become infected after receiving one or two vaccine doses, and to describe the symptoms and duration of covid-19 illness after vaccination.\n\nWhat did it find? The first part of the study looked at people\u2019s chances of testing positive after vaccination. It included 6030 (0.5%) people who reported a positive covid-19 test on the app after their first vaccination but before their second. After the first vaccination: Among people aged 60 and older, those who were frail were almost twice as likely (93% more likely) to test positive for covid-19 than those who were not frail\n\nPeople who lived in the most deprived areas had an 11% higher risk of testing positive than those in areas with average deprivation; those living in the least deprived areas had a 9% lower risk than the average\n\nPeople without obesity were less likely (16% less likely) to test positive than those with obesity. The second part of the study included a further 2370 (0.2%) people who reported a positive test after their second dose. It looked at the severity of illness, based on data on symptoms (and admissions to hospital). Those who tested positive were compared with others using the app, who had not been infected. People who tested positive after vaccination generally had less severe illness. Compared with unvaccinated people, those who had been vaccinated:\n\nWere more likely to be completely without symptoms\n\nWere less likely to be admitted to hospital with covid-19\n\nWere less likely to have five symptoms or more during their first week of illness\n\nWere half as likely to have symptoms that lasted 28 days or more (49% less likely) if they\u2019d had two vaccinations.\n\nWhy is this important? People in this study reported their own test results, vaccination status, and information about other conditions. This allowed many to participate, but their data were not checked by researchers. In addition, women were more likely than men to participate, and few people included data about their ethnicity. People from more deprived areas were under-represented. Despite these drawbacks, the results helped inform the UK\u2019s vaccine booster programme\u2014which prioritised older people\u2014in autumn 2021. The study shows the effectiveness of the vaccine at reducing the severity of covid-19, and at reducing the chances of long term symptoms which can become long covid. The study also shows that frail older people remain at risk of catching covid-19 after vaccination. These people may not be able to isolate because they need others to assist them in daily life. They tend also to have reduced immune function and are more likely to become ill when they encounter the virus. This research was carried out before the emergence of the omicron variant, which is far more infectious. However, the researchers say the general lessons of who is most at risk\u2014and the benefits of vaccination\u2014still hold true.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? The UK vaccine booster programme is continuing, and the researchers say that particular effort is needed to ensure that the most vulnerable groups\u2014frail older people and those living in deprived areas\u2014take up booster jabs. Legal restrictions, including social distancing, self-isolation, and mask wearing to protect against covid-19, have now been lifted. The study results underline the need to continue to be cautious around the most vulnerable people, even if they have been vaccinated. These groups need to be prioritised in current and future booster campaigns. Research is ongoing into the reasons why people from deprived areas are more likely to be vulnerable to infection with the coronavirus. Researchers are exploring whether long term daily life stresses can impair people\u2019s immune response."

The evolving evidence base regarding infectivity, risk of transmission, risk of reinfection (dependent on circulating variants), and immunity (influenced by post-infection and post-vaccination waning immunity) can make this very challenging.\n\nThere are several reasons why individuals with covid-19 and those caring for them are interested to understand whether they are still infectious:\n\nIndividual concern about passing on infection to others\n\nHealthcare workers to make risk assessment before patient discharge or interventions\n\nPolicy makers to provide risk reduction recommendations.\n\nThis article reviews core underlying principles and explains how interpretation of laboratory data\u2014including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen based lateral flow device (LFD), and antibody testing\u2014can support discussions.\n\nWhen is an individual non-infectious? There are insufficient data to precisely delineate when an individual is no longer infectious, and the risk is a continuum with considerable inter-person variability. Individual risk assessments will probably always be required (box 1) and will need to take into account the general risk of infection in the community, including risks posed by new variants (box 2). Box 1 What to consider when a patient asks if they are still infectious The reason for the question\u2014Explore the patient\u2019s concerns and the specific nature of the inquiry\n\nThe consequences of labelling the individual as \u201cinfectious\u201d (psychological, staffing levels, delayed discharge, delayed surgery, etc)\n\nThe consequences of not regarding the individual as potentially infectious\n\nThe risk from this individual relative to the wider community risk\n\nThe results of tests such as PCR, antigen, and antibody (surrogate markers only)\n\nDiscuss infectiousness in terms of levels of risk\n\nAdvise on measures to mitigate that risk (such as cough hygiene, social distancing, mask/face covering (different grades of mask offer different levels of protection), eye protection, hand hygiene)\n\nAdvise that, although patients may have lingering symptoms after infection that are troublesome, these are not indicative of ongoing infection or ongoing infectiousness RETURN TO TEXT Box 2 Example of an individual risk assessment of infectiousness An immunocompetent individual who had mild disease and has now recovered after seven days asks you when they will no longer be infectious. They work in retail, sing in a choir, and are the main carer of an elderly relative, for whom they do not have a reliable alternative carer. They are worried about passing on infection to their work colleagues, friends in the choir, and their elderly relative. Advice for the patient We do not have an exact cut-off point for when someone is no longer infectious. However, in one study of people with mild disease no transmissions occurred five days after the onset of symptoms. Analysis of other data has led scientists to conclude that transmission after 10 days is extremely unlikely.\n\nYou can definitely return to your job in retail after 10 days, as per government advice. You are extremely unlikely to be infectious. You are in fact much less of a risk than other people who haven\u2019t had the virus yet as, if they get infected, they may be unaware but be in the most infectious stage, which happens early on.\n\nEven though you are very unlikely to be infectious, you might want to delay returning to the choir, perhaps until after three weeks. This is simply because you can avoid the choir without any significant detriment to anybody, singing is known to increase the risk of transmission, and even though transmission after day 10 is extremely unlikely, the longer the interval since the time of infection the lower the risk. The virus has been cultured in one immunocompetent individual 18 days after symptom onset, which is why I have suggested three weeks. Similarly, you may decide to delay visiting elderly or vulnerable family members who you don\u2019t need to visit because of the very small potential risk.\n\nHowever, you are the main carer of one elderly relative, and it is important that you can visit them because there is a risk of harm if you are not able to look after them. You can resume caring for them, as you are extremely unlikely to be infectious at this stage. I would suggest that you pay careful attention to the various preventive measures (social distancing, mask wearing, and hand hygiene) as an additional precaution. RETURN TO TEXT Individuals are most infectious in the early stages of the illness, immediately before and shortly after the onset of symptoms.1 Interventions that target this highest risk period (such as identification and behavioural modification of individuals with early disease) are likely to have the biggest impact in controlling transmission overall. Infectivity and viral load decline from the onset of symptoms.12 In one study, no transmissions occurred after day five of symptoms even in household contacts.3 In mild to moderate cases, individuals are considered highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days.45 Over-emphasis on the latter stages of recovery (for example, demonstrating PCR negativity in recovering patients) is unlikely to have a significant impact on transmission and can lead to negative unintended consequences, such as delayed surgery, delayed access to health care, and blocking of healthcare systems. It may still have a place in certain circumstances (for example, among immunocompromised patients). Guidelines worldwide provide recommendations on when it is safe to return to work, broadly based on the likely infectious period.67891011 These guidelines continue to evolve and can be referenced for up-to-date information. There is no longer a legal requirement in the UK for someone who has covid-19 to self isolate, although it is still recommended.12 In Wales healthcare workers are advised to self isolate and to return to work when they have two negative lateral flow test results taken 24 hours apart, starting five days after the date of their initial positive test. Those who continue to test positive are advised to continue testing up to day 10. If they are still positive at that point, they are considered unlikely to still be infectious and they can return to work providing they are medically fit.9 Patients in hospital are typically kept in isolation for 10 days from the onset of symptoms (14 days for those who are severely immunocompromised); they are then able to stop isolating providing that they have been afebrile for 48 hours and all their symptoms (except for cough and anosmia) have resolved. This can be reduced if they meet these clinical criteria and have two negative lateral flow test results taken 24 hours apart, starting six days after the date of their initial test.10 International travel and schools are other areas where transmission risk has been scrutinised. In the case of international travel the concern is primarily related to spread of infectious variants with varying degrees of ability to infect vaccinated individuals. There is still potential for global spread of a more virulent variant of SARS-CoV-2. However, the omicron wave has largely tempered those fears for now. In addition, attempts to prevent infiltration of variants through travel restrictions have to date been largely unsuccessful apart from in countries where very strict travel restrictions are put in place before any threat of introduction of the new variant (for example, New Zealand). Risks of transmission in schools need to be balanced against the negative impact on children\u2019s mental wellbeing and education, particularly given that most children are at low risk of complications from covid-19.\n\nAre all individuals equally infectious? Individuals are not equally infectious. Onward transmission varies according to specific host and contact factors and the nature of the exposure (box 3). Transmission is primarily related to direct contact with an infected individual. In one study, transmission rates on trains were highest in those in adjacent seats (attack rate 3.5% (range 0 to 10.3%)) and increased with time (0.15% per hour) and proximity.13 Transmission in passengers who immediately occupied a positive individual\u2019s vacated seat occurred in only one out of 1342 cases (0.075%).13 Household contacts (11.8%) are more likely than non-household contacts (1.2%) to develop disease.14 Box 3 Factors associated with increased risk of transmission Environment Indoors\n\nPoor ventilation\n\nCrowding\n\nClose proximity (roughly <2 metres, but transmission is a continuum, the further away the better)\n\nShared facilities\n\nCold ambient temperature\n\nLow humidity Host factors Recently infected (highest risk around the time of symptom onset)\n\nHigh viral loads\n\nSevere disease (risk ratios 3.76 (95% CI 1.1 to 12.76) and 3.99 (1.00 to 15.84) for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome/sepsis3)\n\nAge\n\nComorbidity\n\nImmunocompromised Behavioural Singing, shouting, chanting\n\nCoughing and poor cough etiquette\n\nSneezing\n\nHugging, kissing\n\nMask etiquette\n\nHand hygiene\n\nAerosol generating procedure\n\nDuration of contact Viral factors Changes in the viral genome have been linked to increased transmissibility (for example, D614G and variant of concern VOC-202012/01, both of which have changes in the spike protein) RETURN TO TEXT Investigations of outbreaks have demonstrated very high attack rates in specific settings.151617 These large scale, \u201csuper-spreader\u201d events,151617 are characterised by explosive early growth and sustained transmission in later stages,18 with 20% of infected individuals triggering 80% of all infections.19 As transmission is unpredictable and random in nature (stochastic), exercise caution to not over-interpret data from small groups.20\n\nWhat other factors affect the risk of transmission? Transmission is influenced by external factors, which should be considered as part of any assessment (box 3): Prevention measures\u2014masks,21 social distancing, vaccination status, hand hygiene, etc\n\nThe activity being undertaken (such as choir)\n\nThe environment (higher risk in crowded or shared facilities and if ventilation is poor)\n\nThe susceptibility and risk of severe disease among contacts. Individuals are most infectious just before and just after symptom onset. Infectivity decreases thereafter, with transmission after day 10 considered extremely unlikely following mild or moderate disease. Immunocompromised people and those with severe disease are likely to be infectious for a longer, undefined period. Resolution of symptoms is reassuring, signifying development of immunity with likely reduced risk of transmission. Other preventive measures (hand hygiene, mask wearing, social distancing) reduce residual risk further.\n\nWhat surrogate markers are used to decide on infectivity? There is currently no ideal surrogate marker for infectiousness (table 1). Viral culture is not a routinely available test in most settings. PCR overestimates the duration of infectiousness but can underestimate risk by virtue of false negative results. Lateral flow devices (LFDs) identify the most infectious individuals reliably but don\u2019t detect all infectious individuals. LFDs do not have the same issues of residual positivity as PCR. Table 1 Surrogate markers of infectiousness View this table: Culture Most recommendations are based on viral PCR and culture (table 1). Viral culture confirms the presence of intact, viable, and potentially infectious virus. Although the circumstances required for viral culture are not the same as for transmission, it is considered a reasonable surrogate. In immunocompetent individuals, positive culture beyond day 10 in patients with mild disease is uncommon.4 It is more common in those with severe disease.26333435 Virus has been detected up to day 18 in mild disease,2425 day 111 in severe disease,26 and day 119 in an immunocompromised individual.2223 Individuals may not be very infectious even when culturable virus is present. One individual with severe infection who was culture-positive at day 111 did not cause any secondary infections despite quarantine termination at three months.26 Also, no infections occurred in 852 contacts exposed to individuals with mild disease after day five.3 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Previously, guidelines advocated use of PCR as a surrogate for non-infectiousness but studies on viral dynamics have shown that there are several reasons why this is not appropriate. PCR can detect non-viable virus and overestimates the duration of infectivity,3282931 with one surveillance study reporting no secondary cases among 790 contacts of 285 \u201cpersistently positive\u201d people.36 Relying on PCR as a measure of non-infectiousness may prolong hospital admission and isolation unnecessarily.30\n\nResults can fluctuate from positive to negative at all stages of infection, can become positive again even after two consecutive negative tests,233738 can be detected for longer in those with severe infection,2239 and may fluctuate at the level of detection for several weeks.40\n\nResults vary according to sample site (lower respiratory tract samples remaining positive for longer).38\n\nFalse negative results can provide false reassurance.31 Results can be semi-quantified by the number of cycles required to reach the predetermined positive threshold\u2014the cycle threshold (CT). Low CT values indicate high viral loads (strong positive <25); high CT values (>35) may indicate low viral loads (weak positive). Weak positive results are most common in the very early and late stages of infection but may also be false positives.41 The CT value is probably linked to infectiousness3042; supported by decreased ability to culture the virus as the CT value increases45253342 and as found with other diseases.43 The CT value is affected by some external factors, such as swab quality and disease stage (lower in early disease but may be rising), so results need to be interpreted with caution. Lateral flow devices (LFDs) LFD antigen tests detect a protein antigen which forms part of the viral wall. When present, it is indicative of ongoing replication and therefore the presence of infectious virus. Comparative studies have shown that it is less sensitive than PCR, detecting around 65-89% of PCR-positive samples.44 However, the sensitivity is higher in those with higher viral loads (96% for >1 000 000 copies per mL, 92% for 10 000\u20131 000 000 copies per mL, and 43% for <10 000 copies per mL45) and those who were culture positive (>95%).44 It has been estimated that LFD tests would detect 83-89% of cases with PCR-positive contacts.46 The rapid turnaround time and practicality of lateral flow tests mean they provide a reasonable testing strategy for reducing infection risk in certain circumstances\u2014such as when PCR testing is not practical, when the consequences of a false negative result are acceptable, and when the balance of risks (immediate LFD result v delayed PCR result) favours their use.\n\nWhen are individuals considered to be immune? Individuals are understandably keen to know whether they are susceptible to reinfection. Reinfection with phylogenetically distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported after as little as 48 days47 in an otherwise healthy 25 year old man. Asymptomatic reinfection (PCR positivity)4849 and infection with milder disease5051 and more severe disease4751 have all been described. Over time, infection and reinfection have resulted in milder disease at the population level, which is probably related to improved immunity combined with reduced virulence of emerging strains. Reinfection is more likely to be established in individuals with symptoms and more severe disease. The risk of reinfection is a function of the level of immunity present and the infecting viral strain (for example, vaccine escape variants), which is in turn dependent on the strain(s) circulating in the community at that time. Immunity decreases with time from infection or vaccination. Reinfection is more likely when a new strain emerges, particularly if that strain has properties that enable it to evade immunity developed from previous infection or vaccination. An example of this was seen with the rapid spread of the omicron variant in late 2021. What factors can you discuss when asked by a patient if they are immune? What is known about the response to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. immunity lasts at least 90 days and likely longer in most people)\n\nThe different types of immunity (T cell and antibody)\n\nThat current tests are only surrogate markers for immunity and do not take account of immune memory\n\nReinfections can occur\n\nReinfections are often milder than the first episode\n\nRecovered individuals should comply with prevention measures to avoid reinfection Most people will be protected from symptomatic reinfection for at least five months, and the immediate risk of reinfection is low (0.02%, incidence rate 0.36 per 10 000 person weeks).5253 There is evidence of increased protection from infection in individuals who are vaccinated after a primary infection, with one prospective cohort study showing that infection-acquired immunity waned after one year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in people infected more than 18 months previously.54 Immunity in coronavirus infections Evidence from infections with other coronaviruses (seasonal coronaviruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1) and surrogate markers of immunity (antibody and T cell responses) can help inform our understanding of immunity in SARS-CoV-2 Seasonal coronavirus Serological studies from the 1960s suggest cycling of infection, with different coronavirus strains predominating every two to four years.55 Re-challenge experiments (table 2) suggest complete immunity from symptomatic reinfection for at least one year if \u201creinfected\u201d with the same strain, but only partial immunity when exposed to a heterologous strain.5657 Short duration asymptomatic shedding is possible following re-challenge with the same strain.60 Table 2 Coronavirus re-challenge experiments View this table: Immunity to seasonal coronavirus is not lifelong.60 Most children are seropositive for seasonal coronavirus by age 3.5 years, yet seasonal coronavirus infections account for ~25% of acute respiratory illness into adulthood.60 SARS-CoV-2 Data on immune response to infection and vaccination is continuing to evolve. Presence of antibody is not proof of immunity. Neutralising antibody tests are considered most predictive of protection but are not available routinely. Neutralising antibodies develop in most infected individuals (>90%),61 although in some the levels are very low or absent,62 suggesting that other elements of the immune system are driving recovery. Antibody responses are stronger and last longer after severe infection.63 Given the protective nature of antibodies in seasonal coronavirus infection, we might expect protection against the same strain to last for most people for at least 12 months. However, viral evolution may be more frequent and common in the early phases of the pandemic, and immunity akin to that seen in studies of seasonal coronavirus in adults may take time to develop. There are currently four approved vaccines in the UK64 and more available worldwide. Data from vaccination studies show that protection wanes over time but lasts in most people for at least four months.65 Pfizer vaccine was effective against symptomatic disease in 96% up to two months, 90% for two to four months, and 84% for four to six months. Protective efficacy of the vaccine from symptomatic disease varies according to viral strain and patient age in the range of 70%66 to 95%.65 Protection against severe infection, hospitalisation, and death is higher still. At the time of writing vaccination has proved effective against all naturally circulating strains. Evidence regarding the efficacy against the latest variant (omicron) is continuing to emerge, although protection is definitely reduced.67 Immunity derived from vaccination declines over time. In recognition of this, the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended a fourth vaccine dose (Spring booster approximately six months after the previous dose) for those at higher risk of covid-19. This will likely be repeated in the autumn. Decisions on booster vaccinations for the general population will be made in response to evolving evidence. In summary, infection with coronaviruses do not result in lifelong immunity, and reinfection is common. The natural course for coronavirus infection includes repeat exposure and repeat infection over a variable time course. Over time, SARS-CoV-2 will likely transform into a seasonal coronavirus infection. With the development of increased immunity the risk of re-exposure and reinfection will decline, and the period between episodes will likely increase. Patient\u2019s perspective: Uncertainty about immunity When I discovered I had covid-19, I had numerous symptoms and remained unwell for a protracted period. The symptoms lifted suddenly after five and a half months when I woke up feeling better. When I started to go out, I was extremely cautious despite it being weeks since the onset of my symptoms. I was conscious of not touching any walls\u2014what if an elderly person touched the same wall hours later, caught the virus from me, and died? If someone walked down the street, I gave them a wide berth. I questioned whether it was irresponsible of me to leave the house for a walk on my road\u2014I checked and double-checked the guidance. I still have mixed feelings about how information on immunity affects my decision making. It is now six months since the onset of my symptoms. Part of my confidence in visiting vulnerable relatives comes from a sense that I am less likely to pass covid on to them unknowingly because I am less likely to get infected again. But then I worry about reinfections\u2014what if I get covid again but have very few symptoms and unknowingly spread it? The uncertainty about immunity makes some decision making hard\u2014who to see and when. What happens when our immunity runs out? And will I ever know when this happens? I do not feel that having had covid removes much of this uncertainty. It hasn\u2019t really added much confidence for me, as I still have so many unanswered questions.

        "Monkeypox\u2014not doing enough is not an option",
        "Boghuma K Titanji , assistant professor of medicine Emory University, Atlanta, USA\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic should have taught us that there's no time to lose when it comes to responding to emerging disease threats, writes Boghuma K Titanji\n\nOutbreaks of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in non-endemic countries have grown steadily in recent weeks, causing increasing international concern. Since the first cases were reported in the UK in early May, more than 5000 cases have been recorded in 52 countries and territories.1 MPXV is an old pathogen, which has caused human outbreaks in countries across west and central Africa for more than 50 years and has mostly been ignored by the rest of the world.2 The situation we are witnessing is unusual because of the large number of cases occurring simultaneously outside endemic locations; local human-to-human transmission in non-endemic settings; and the clustering of cases in specific social networks of primarily gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.2 This has drawn global attention to the once neglected disease, leaving many wondering how big this outbreak will become and what its impact will be.\n\nAs we weather a third year of the global covid-19 pandemic, these uncertainties about MPXV are amplified by the fear of another infectious disease outbreak that might lead to loss of health, social disruption, and economic crisis. The situation with MPXV is worrying but different from what we have witnessed with covid-19. We have more existing knowledge, from historical outbreaks, about how this virus is transmitted, and vaccines and antiviral drugs are available as potential tools to contain it.2 Although this should be reassuring, the many missteps of the covid-19 pandemic response prompt valid concerns about whether the world is better prepared to respond to emerging disease threats.\n\nA response characterised by complacency The systems for outbreak response developed and optimised during covid-19 could rapidly be engaged for scaling up key elements of MPXV containment, such as testing, contact tracing, and deployment of vaccination and therapeutics. In reality, however, the response in many countries has been more muted and plagued by complacency and outbreak fatigue. The US, for example, has so far recorded 395 confirmed cases of MPXV,1 yet testing has been abysmally slow and access to vaccination for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis is limited, despite existing national stockpiles of smallpox vaccines,3 which are effective in preventing monkeypox. As outbreaks in non-endemic countries have dominated the news, countries in west and central Africa that are also dealing with MPXV outbreaks, such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo, have once again been excluded from the conversation about access to vaccines, testing, and antiviral treatments. Just this week South Africa reported its first case of MPXV with no link to travel to any of the countries with ongoing outbreaks.4 There is growing unease that we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg, the scale of which remains to be clearly defined. Yet a concerted global response once again appears sadly severely lacking, with mistakes of the recent past playing out in real time. The reasons behind the lack of urgency in the response to MPXV are multifaceted and complex. The estimated mortality of the west African clade of MPXV responsible for the ongoing outbreak5 (based on previous outbreaks) is around 3-6%6; in 2022 so far, one death has been recorded in a non-endemic country and 72 deaths in endemic countries.7 This makes MPXV infection less deadly than Ebola virus disease, for example. The notion of \u201cdisease mildness\u201d has unfortunately translated into MPXV outbreaks not being prioritised in the same way as other outbreaks in recent history. The concentration of cases in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men has engendered narratives of stigma and blame reminiscent of the early days of the HIV epidemic, during which infection with HIV was blamed on sexual orientation and entire communities were ostracised and abandoned. It also gives the broader population a false sense of security, and with geopolitical unrest in eastern Europe, ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, an impending economic recession threatening the world, and a covid-19 pandemic that is far from over, MPXV outbreaks couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\n\nFailure to declare an emergency On 23 June 2022, the World Health Organization convened an emergency committee meeting to discuss whether the current MPXV situation constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).8 In a surprising turn of events, WHO declined to make that determination based on expert advice.8 What happened to acting quickly, acting decisively, and having no regrets? The stringent criteria for declaring a PHEIC require \u201can extraordinary event which constitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and potentially requires a coordinated international response.\u201d9 A PHEIC is formulated when the situation is deemed to be \u201cserious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected,\u201d with implications beyond the borders of the affected countries.9 Certainly, the current monkeypox outbreak checks a lot of these boxes and the failure to pull the PHEIC lever now has a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, running the risk of making an already bad situation worse. Historically, PHEICs have been fraught with controversy and many commentators have debated whether they make a difference in outbreak response.10 However, these declarations draw the attention of the public and raise the priority level of the problem. PHEIC declarations also have the potential to mobilise international coordination, streamline funding, and accelerate research towards development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics under emergency use authorisation.10 Whether this always translates into an organised global response centred on equity is a whole other question.\n\nInequalities persist After initial hesitation, covid-19 was declared a PHEIC on 30 January 202011 and a global pandemic six weeks later. Soon thereafter, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines was launched in the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator.12 This initiative and others played an important part in getting vaccines and therapeutic access to lower resourced countries but were limited in achieving their full potential because of the failure of wealthy countries to honour their commitments. As a result, Africa remains the continent with the lowest covid-19 vaccination coverage and limited access to covid-19 therapeutics.13 Also important to consider are the ethical undertones of declaring an infectious disease outbreak a PHEIC only when high income countries are affected, thereby reinforcing a double standard that sees diseases affecting poor people afforded less importance. This is a valid interpretation of what has happened with MPXV, which has plagued countries in Africa for decades, yet struggled for attention and research funding to tackle it. Before the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, Ebola virus disease suffered the same fate; it was an obscure disease that nobody cared about, primarily causing deadly outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. When the west African outbreak was declared a PHEIC in July 201410 (albeit after a much criticised four month delay by WHO), it moved forward more than 10 years of stalled progress on vaccines and therapeutics research for the disease, which had been neglected for years, putting the world in a better position to respond to outbreaks that have come since. Covid-19 revealed the many shortfalls of the existing systems designed to respond to global threats from infectious diseases. Coming out of the pandemic, these systemic issues have been compounded by an erosion of public trust, polarisation in the public health discourse, and the flood of misinformation and disinformation. This creates a very challenging landscape for navigating future outbreaks, but seeking perfection in the response to MPXV would be losing precious time and giving this virus more chances to spread, adapt, and become more deeply entrenched globally. Whether our next move comes through a PHEIC declaration in the future for MPXV or other mechanisms is beside the point if the response continues to be defined by inertia and hesitation. MPXV deserves more urgency; we are simply not doing enough and this is unacceptable, especially for a disease which has made its way to centre stage as a direct result of decades of inaction and neglect."

        "Covid-19: virology, variants, and vaccines",
        "Introduction Seven coronaviruses can infect humans, all belonging to the alpha or beta subgroups, including 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta).1 Over the past two decades, three notable beta coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2011; and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019) have emerged and caused severe illness, resulting in debilitating disease and worldwide deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and has caused more than 5.59 million deaths in around two years and resulted in multisystem illness in several million people.2 All viruses change and mutate over time, with most changes having little to no impact. However, some mutations could alter its pathogenic or transmission potential and might, therefore, increase disease severity or hinder the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization3 classifies variants of concern as SARS-CoV-2 variants that increase transmissibility, disease severity, or virulence or that decrease the effectiveness of public health measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. Variants of interest are variants with genetic changes predicted to enhance the virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which have been identified to cause community transmission in multiple countries and pose a possible risk to global public health. Lastly, variants under monitoring are those with genetic changes are suspected to affect virus characteristics and have currently unclear phenotypic or epidemiological effects. Variants under monitoring are not typically assigned a name until they are upgraded to variants of interest or concern. The full working definitions of variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring can be found on the WHO website for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).3 As of 25 January 2022, WHO reports five variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron), two variants of interest (lambda and mu), and three variants under monitoring.3 Former variants of concern, variants of interest, or variants under monitoring have been reclassified as \"formerly monitored variants,\" owing to these variants no longer circulating, having little impact on the epidemiological situation, or having no concerning properties.3 Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the rapid development of effective covid-19 vaccines has taken place around the world. As of 24 January 2022, 33 vaccines have been approved for use in 197 countries, with 10 vaccines having gained emergency use listing approval from WHO.4 In this review, we provide an overview of the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2, describing how these elements allow the virus to infect and replicate inside of host cells, before outlining how certain mutations harboured by SARS-CoV-2 variants enhance these abilities. Next, we examine the current state of vaccine development around the world and provide evidence of the effectiveness of booster doses.\n\nSources and selection criteria We searched PubMed and Embase databases for covid-19 related articles published between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2022 and for general coronavirus related articles published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Our search terms included SARS-CoV-2, covid-19, and specific terms including virology, genome, variants, and vaccine. Additional, specific search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 1. We performed further manual searching for additional articles and data using relevant databases, including who.int, gov.uk, and ecdc.europa.eu/en. Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of the literature involving SARS-CoV-2, we also searched preprint databases including MedRxiv and BioRxiv. We selected studies through different criteria (online supplemental file 1), owing to the various topics discussed here. Overall, studies were selected on the basis of quality and impact factor of publishing journal, with real world studies with large sample sizes of the greatest interest. Supplemental material [bmjmed-2021-000040supp001.pdf]\n\nViral transmission, clinical presentation, and genetic susceptibility of covid-19 SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread via respiratory droplet transmission, spreading between people through close contact, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission, fomite transmission, and via other modes, such as through biological material including urine and faeces.5 6 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces or survive suspended in air droplets for long periods. Indeed, on plastic, stainless steel, and glass surfaces, the half life of the virus is around 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 hours, respectively,7 with no difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 variants.8 Although SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on inanimate surfaces for hours and days, owing to the evaporation of water droplets (the viruses\u2019 living environment), the concentration of the virus plummets rapidly.9 Protective measures, including use of personal protective equipment, maintenance of indoor ventilation, and disinfection hands and surfaces, can effectively limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.10 Once inside the airways, SARS-CoV-2 can infect ciliated, mucus secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes within the lungs, and the conjunctival mucosa.11 The clinical presentation of covid-19 is non-specific and heterogeneous, and infection can result in a wide spectrum of symptoms. After an incubation period of 4-14 days, symptoms range from mild to severe disease and, in some instances, can result in death.12 The most common covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue,13 14 while myalgia, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms are reported. Asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for covid-19.15 16 Although the entire population is susceptible to covid-19 infection, some subgroups within the general population are more susceptible to developing poorer clinical outcomes. Risk factors associated with increased probability of hospital admission, severe disease, and fatal outcome with covid-19 have been identified. Older age17\u201319; male sex20 21; belonging to an ethnic minority group21 22; and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease,18 23\u201325 malignancy, and immunodeficiency26\u201328 have all been associated with more severe covid-19. The duration and treatment of covid-19 symptoms will also have profound influences on the severity of disease and the acute and long term outcomes after recovery. The host genetic background is thought to have an influence on the susceptibility and severity of covid-19, possibly explaining the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that can develop in seemingly similar individuals. A meta-analysis, consisting of 49,562 patients with covid-19 across numerous ancestry groups, identified four gene loci associated with susceptibility to covid-19 (SLC6A20, RPL24, ABO, PLEKHA4) and nine associated with increased risk of severe covid-19 (LZTFL1, FOXP4, TMEM65, OAS1, KANSL1, TAC4, DPP9, RAVER1, and IFNAR2).29 Meanwhile, genome wide association studies spanning across Europe, the US, and the UK identified a gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) as being strongly linked with susceptibility and severity of covid-19.30 31 Polymorphisms in the genes of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have also been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 viral entry,32 33 with differential polymorphisms seen across ethnic minority populations, which might partly explain why certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe covid-19. Increased ACE2 receptor levels have also been associated with other risk factors of covid-19, including smoking and increasing age.34 The use of polygenetic risk scores might be useful in determining an individual\u2019s risk for developing severe disease caused by covid-19.35 A polygenetic risk score infers a person\u2019s risk of susceptibility to, or development of, a certain disease based on the total number of genomic variations they possess. Determining polygenetic risk scores with the inclusion of comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,36 or other aspects such as coagulation factors,37 could improve the usefulness of these scores in determining a person\u2019s risk of severe covid-19.\n\nVirology of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses, which have crown-like appearances, are the largest known RNA viruses and are thought to primarily infect vertebrates.38 39 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus of the coronaviruses and has a genome size varying from 29.8 to 29.9 kb.40 Human coronavirus genomes consist of a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs). Following the typical 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order, the beginning two thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, inside the host cell, are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum into polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), respectively.40 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp): nsp1-11, from pp1a; and nsp12-16, from pp1ab. The proteolytic release of nsp1 occurs rapidly, which enables it to interfere with translation processes of the host cell by inducing cellular mRNA degradation.41\u201343 Nsp2-16 contain the viruses\u2019 replication and transcription complex and encode multiple enzymes with many functions, including proteases, helicase, polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease, N7-methyltransferase and 2\u2019O-methyltransferase, and de-ubiquitination enzymes.44 45 The final third of human coronavirus genomes contain genes that encode structural and accessory proteins. The four major structural proteins encoded here are the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike glycoprotein (S) proteins.46 47 The N protein is associated with the viral RNA genome, is involved in RNA synthesis regulation, and interacts with the M protein during viral budding.39 48 The M protein is important for viral assembly, it contains a short N-terminal domain that projects onto the external surface of the envelope and a long internal C-terminal.39 The E protein function is largely unknown; however, along with the N and M proteins, it is required for viral assembly and release.47 Lastly, the S protein gives coronaviruses their characteristic spikes that compose their crownlike appearance. This protein projects through the viral envelope, is heavily glycosylated, and regulates host cell membrane receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.49 The functions of the 11 accessory proteins encoded within the one-third closest to the 3\u2019 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not fully understood. These accessory proteins are encoded by the ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORC9c, and ORF10 genes. Some of these proteins, including ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, are interferon antagonists that impair the host cell immune response,50\u201353 whereas ORF3a might promote virus release54 and is involved in apoptosis of host cells through caspase-3 activation.55 ORF9b and ORF9c are known to suppress the host antiviral response by interacting with host cell organelles,56\u201358 whereas a clear understanding of the functions of ORF3c, ORF7b, and ORF10 remains unclear.59 Figure 1 (A,B) depicts the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genome and spike (S) protein amino acid composition. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30 000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of open reading frames (ORF) and elements that are essential for the virus\u2019 structure. The S protein is responsible for binding and entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain various S protein non-synonymous mutations that result in amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain (orange bracketed text) and the S1/S2 subunit interface (black bracketed text), which have been shown to enhance transmissibility of the virus. Variants of concern include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and omicron (O). (B) SARS-CoV-2 structure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has a crown-like appearance and contains four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M). (C) Viral S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with human ACE2 receptors in order to gain entry into host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein tightly binds to ACE2. (D) S protein structure. The S protein protrudes out from the main SARS-CoV-2 bulk and is comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 contains the RBD, which directly interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, while the S1/S2 interface contains a furin cleavage site that is cleaved to allow S2 to fuse with the host cell membrane. Both the RBD and the S1/S2 interface contain transmissibility increasing mutations that are harboured in variants of concern The S glycoprotein is composed of two functionally distinct subunits (S1 and S2) and is essential for viral entry into host cells. The N-terminal S1 domain of the protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cell, which is the primary receptor that SARS-Cov-2 uses for cell entry.60 The C-terminal S2 domain fuses the host and viral membranes to allow for entry of the viral genome into the host cell.61 The subunits of the trimeric S complex are either in a closed (pre-fusion stage) or open (post-fusion stage) conformation,62 with one subunit always in an open conformation to allow for ACE2 recognition and binding.63 The RBD itself consists of five anti-parallel \u03b2 strands surrounded by several \u03b1 helices.64 From closed to open conformation, the RBD undergoes structural rearrangement whereby the globular head region rotates clockwise, which alters is elecropotential surface.64 Once positioned, numerous residues within the RBD form either hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with residues of the ACE2 receptor, allowing for tight binding,65 while the concave structure of the RBD allows for three distinct binding regions.64 Following binding between the S protein and the host cell receptor, host cell proteases cleave the S protein, causing the release of the S2 domain which allows for fusion and cell entry.66 Figure 1 (C,D) shows the structure and function of the S protein. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous cell types throughout the human body, including in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosas, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain,67 highlighting the widespread infection that SARS-CoV-2 can inflict. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2, a host cell protease, facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes,68 and could have a role in the spread of the virus in the airways.68 Host cell cathepsin L might also aid in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the S protein.69 Indeed, a clinically approved protease inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.70 Figure 2 depicts the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into and replicates inside host cells, and summarises the host cell immune response. Figure 2 Viral entry and host response. (A) At the alveolar epithelial cell layer. Epithelial cells in the lungs express both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing for infection by SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the virus within these cells induces an intense immune response that attracts monocytes, T cells, and macrophages and, in some instances, can result in a cytokine storm. (B) Within nearby blood vessels. Cytokines produced by the epithelial cell layer are released into blood vessels supplying the infected tissue, which causes the recruitment of further immune cells to the area, driving the damaging inflammatory response further. Circulating cytokines also create a systemic inflammatory environment. (C) Adaptive immune response. Circulating lymphocytes carry viral antigens to lymph nodes and bone marrow to begin the adaptive immune system processes whereby B cells, and later antibodies, are activated. (D) SARS-CoV2 host replication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into human cells. Following release of the viral RNA within the host cell, the virus uses the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to produce and manufacture new viral particles, which are released out of the cell to infect other cells and new hosts\n\nEmerging treatments As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19.309 Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK,310 311 US,312 313 and Europe314 315 for treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK,316 US,317 and Europe.318 These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below.\n\nGuidelines The treatment and management of covid-19 is a continually evolving topic; however, health authorities have published and continue to update guidelines and recommendations for treating covid-19. The WHO living guideline on covid-19 and treatment is regularly updated, with the latest version (published on 14 January 2022) containing 14 recommendations on covid-19 treatment.319 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence320 and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency321 provide updated guidelines on covid-19 treatment, and in Europe, the ECDC regularly publishes several guidelines providing recommendations on a range of covid-19 related topics.322 The US National Institutes of Health323 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention324 provide guidance on covid-19 treatment and management, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplying guidelines for specific groups such as employers, schools, health departments, and governments.\n\nConsiderations for the future Novel infectious diseases and pandemics are an unpredictable but inevitable aspect of nature; therefore, we should learn from past pandemics to prepare for future ones. Firstly, the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and amplified the existing inequalities within society,325 with Black ethnicity, social disadvantage, and unemployment being risk factors for covid-19 infection326 and those groups most economically deprived found to be particularly vulnerable.327 These inequalities need resolving in order for us to be better prepared for similar situations in the future. Next, to progress through a pandemic we should be racing against the pathogen, and not against each other. This statement becomes apparent when considering the problems faced by countries seeking out personal protective equipment,328 and the vaccine inequity seen worldwide,329 with developed countries often better placed to be able to purchase these items. Initiatives such as WHO\u2019s COVAX programme are vital to protect the most vulnerable groups and reduce the global spread of disease. In October 2021, the UK government released a publication outlining where the policies implemented to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic failed, and the lessons learnt from these failures.330 The publication then presents conclusions and recommendations on how to enhance pandemic preparedness, lockdown and social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, social care, and vaccines. In countries such as the UK, US, and much of Europe, where the covid-19 death rate has been high, steps need to be taken and lessons need to be learnt in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. The responsibility of improving pandemic response lies with policy makers, the medical/scientific community, and the public, and will ultimately require a collaborative approach. However, certain aspects of the response to the covid-19 pandemic have been a triumph. One major victory was the rapid development and rollout of vaccines,331 which continue to be effective. The rollout of rapid testing and quarantine for infected individuals was also important to at least disrupt the spread of the virus, especially given that asymptomatic individuals can contribute to the spread. Furthermore, the swift identification and sharing of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants between countries should be applauded. Lessons can be learnt from countries where covid-19 was controlled. In Taiwan, authorities managing the pandemic as directed by pre-covid-19 pandemic plans prompted an immediate response. Screening of all airline passengers arriving from Wuhan and high risk areas, restricting entry for non-Taiwanese citizens, 14 day quarantine periods for contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 or returning travellers, a ban on large gatherings, and widespread mask wearing were some of the quickly implemented management strategies.332 New Zealand implemented similarly effective restrictions, with the addition of a national lockdown.332 Many of the pandemic control components that kept infection and death numbers low in Taiwan and New Zealand could be adopted by other countries in the future and could lead to improved outcomes in terms of protecting the health of individuals and the health and wellbeing of the country. Overall, much can be learnt from the covid-19 pandemic and, as we emerge from it, the inspection of which policies failed and which succeeded is imperative.\n\nConclusion Covid-19 remains prevalent and life threatening. Although the rollout of vaccines has been successful, attaining a high global vaccination coverage and ensuring that all healthcare systems have the capacity to cope with seasonal waves are essential. With the omicron variant highly prevalent, we must continue to learn, develop therapeutics, and remain vigilant to new variants of concern. Here, we have provided an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, including the mutations harboured by variants of the virus and how these mutations effect its transmissibility and virulence. We have also discussed the vaccines that have been developed and used around the world and have provided evidence supporting the rollout of booster doses. Future priorities should focus on continuing vaccination programmes and developing variant specific vaccines as new mutations emerge. This strategy, along with the expansion of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and which treatments are most successful to treat covid-19 infections will ultimately lead to favourable outcomes. Questions for future research How will the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutate in the future, and which mutations will give a competitive advantage that will allow the virus to inflict disease to many people?\n\nHow do we keep up with the rapidly changing SARS-CoV-2 environment and ensure that vaccines remain effective?\n\nHow do we manage the booster programme and when will future booster vaccinations be required in order to maintain high levels of immunity?\n\nHow can we learn from the current and past pandemics so that we are better prepared for the next one?

        "The NHS is not living with covid, it\u2019s dying from it",
        "Alastair McLellan , editor in chief 1, Kamran Abbasi , editor in chief 2 1HSJ 2The BMJ kabbasi{at}bmj.com , alastair.mclellan{at}hsj.co.uk\n\nThe government must be honest about the threat the pandemic still poses\n\nToday may be the most difficult day the NHS has ever experienced. The headlines will focus on the pressures created by the heatwave and that most visible sign of healthcare failure\u2014ambulances queuing outside hospitals.1 But, as readers of The BMJ and HSJ know all too well, this brutal situation is the culmination of many factors, which include but are not limited to prolonged periods of underfunding in the past decade,2 lack of an adequate workforce plan,34 and a cowardly and shortsighted failure to undertake social care reform.5\n\nThere is one more problem. Most people (including many in the NHS) are so tired of it that they are wilfully pushing it to the back of their minds, but now is the time to face the fact that the nation\u2019s attempt to \u201clive with covid\u201d is the straw that is breaking the NHS\u2019s back. In 2020 and 2021 the NHS coped with pandemic peaks by stopping or slowing much of its routine work. 2022 was meant to be the year of full speed recovery, when we would build back better and fairer, when record waiting lists in elective care, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and mental health would begin to reduce, and the workload on primary care would begin to ease.\n\nOne of the assumptions underpinning this hope was that covid-19 would be nothing more than an irritant for most of the year, with perhaps a winter wave in December. It is now July, and not counting the first omicron surge that peaked in January, the UK and the NHS have experienced two further covid waves,6 with gaps of just under three months between peaks (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/). The current wave of hospital admissions78 driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 variants is likely to peak in the next few days, but other variants will be ready for global distribution soon.9\n\nWeekly hospital admissions to English hospitals, for those who test positive for covid-19, have averaged just over 9000 in the first six and half months of the year. In 2021 the number was just under 6000, with most admissions concentrated in the first two months of the year. The average in 2020 was just under 7000.10\n\nThe omicron variant is less severe, and just under 40% of hospital patients are being treated \u201cprimarily\u201d for the disease.10 But a covid-19 diagnosis is a complicating factor for many conditions, worsening outcomes and lengthening recovery times. The need to keep people with covid-19, uninfected people, and contacts apart means an increase in effort. Higher rates of covid-19 in hospitals and the community also result in more staff sickness, further hollowing out an already overstretched11 and exhausted workforce.12\n\nWhat the hospital admissions figures hide is a rising tide of people with long covid, now at two million13 and likely to be a major burden on the health service14 and the nation\u2019s productivity, for a generation. And there are many other much less recognised but still deeply disturbing effects of the continuing pandemic, including endangering the NHS\u2019s supply of blood.15\n\nGovernment complacency How is the government responding to this crisis? Largely by pretending it is not happening or implying it is all under control. In the House of Lords last week16 government health spokesperson Lord Kammal repeated the spurious line: \u201cWe managed to break the link between infections and hospitalisations and hospitalisations and death.\u201d But the link between infections and hospital admissions has clearly not been broken, even if you just consider those being treated \u201cprimarily\u201d for the disease. As for deaths, the latest ONS figures17 indicate just under 24 000 fatalities \u201cinvolving covid\u201d in the first six months of 2022. Yes, that figure is substantially smaller than the 66 000 recorded in the first half of 2021, but it is more than the 21 000 people who died in the last six months of that year. Excess deaths from all causes are also still running above five year averages before the pandemic. The constant pressure created by repeated covid waves is already the main reason that the NHS is nowhere near reaching the activity levels needed to begin to recover performance. By now the NHS had hoped to be operating better than before the pandemic; instead elective activity is around 10% below 2019.18 The Conservative Party leadership contest\u2014which will deliver the UK\u2019s next prime minister\u2014is shedding little light on the crisis in the NHS and the government\u2019s failing covid policy. The candidates seem more keen to talk about bringing in the army to shake up the NHS19 or criticise \u201cunsustainable\u201d20 spending on healthcare than tackle the immediate and pressing needs of the service. As the NHS is in crisis, health is barely mentioned in leadership debates. What is especially concerning\u2014and makes the decline of the NHS a more realistic concern than it has been for decades\u2014is the lack of great political, public, or media outcry about the covid-driven collapse in services.\n\nReintroducing pandemic measures At no other time in the past 50 years have so many parts of the NHS been so close to ceasing to function effectively. The heart of the problem is the failure to recognise that the pandemic is far from over and that a return to some of the measures taken in the past two years is needed. Existing public health advice to wear masks in crowded places, ensure good ventilation, and test regularly need to be communicated much more powerfully and widely. This should include a return to mask wearing in healthcare settings and on public transport, as well as re-introduction of free tests for the public.21 Vaccination is the fourth pillar of action. Large sections of the population,22 particularly ethnic minorities and younger age groups, are still not fully vaccinated. Other measures might include working from home when possible and restrictions on some types and sizes of gathering. The government must also work out how it will support the sections of the population and the economy that will be affected by those measures. The blueprint for managing the pandemic was described in the \u201cvaccine plus strategy\u201d proposed by Greenhalgh and others in The BMJ in January 2022.23 Above all, the government must stop gaslighting the public and be honest about the threat the pandemic still poses to them and the NHS. Being honest with the public will have two positive results, it will encourage the public to modify behaviour and, we hope, provoke urgent reflection about how the NHS is in such a mess so soon after the nation was applauding it on their doorsteps."

Design Test negative design. Setting Long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada, 30 December 2021 to 27 April 2022. Participants After exclusions, 61 344 residents aged 60 years or older across 626 long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Main outcome measures Laboratory confirmed omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection (any and symptomatic) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and hospital admission or death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate marginal effectiveness (four versus three doses) and vaccine effectiveness (two, three, or four doses versus no doses) while adjusting for personal characteristics, comorbidities, week of test, and previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days previously. Results 13 654 residents who tested positive for omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection and 205 862 test negative controls were included. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose (95% of vaccine recipients received mRNA-1273 as the fourth dose) seven days or more after vaccination versus a third dose received 84 or more days previously was 19% (95% confidence interval 12% to 26%) against infection, 31% (20% to 41%) against symptomatic infection, and 40% (24% to 52%) against severe outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness in vaccine recipients (compared with unvaccinated) increased with each additional dose, and for a fourth dose was 49% (95% confidence interval 43% to 54%) against infection, 69% (61% to 76%) against symptomatic infection, and 86% (81% to 90%) against severe outcomes. Conclusions The findings suggest that compared with a third dose of mRNA covid-19 vaccine, a fourth dose improved protection against infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes among long term care residents during an omicron dominant period. A fourth vaccine dose was associated with strong protection against severe outcomes in vaccinated residents compared with unvaccinated residents, although the duration of protection remains unknown.\n\nIntroduction Residents of long term care facilities are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes for a range of reasons, including risk of exposure to the virus owing to reliance on care from others within a communal setting, underlying comorbidities that increase the risk of severe infection, and age related changes to the immune system (immunosenescence) that might affect the response to covid-19 vaccines.12 In Ontario, which comprises nearly 40% of Canada\u2019s population, long term care facilities are publicly funded institutions that provide housing, medical support, and 24 hour access to personal and nursing care for people\u2014mainly older adults\u2014who are unable to live in the community because of major neurocognitive disorders or disability, or both.3 Currently, Ontario has 626 licensed long term care facilities that collectively care for about 6% of older Ontarians (\u226565 years).45 Residents of long term care facilities in Ontario have been disproportionately affected by the covid-19 pandemic, accounting for nearly two thirds of deaths during the first two waves.2 The introduction of covid-19 vaccines noticeably improved outcomes for such residents within eight weeks, with an 89% relative reduction in infections and 96% reduction in mortality compared with unvaccinated control populations.6 However, the effectiveness of two doses declines over time, and the emergence of new variants of concern led to breakthrough infections and an increase in deaths.78910111213 On 17 August 2021, Ontario began offering a third (first booster) vaccine dose to residents of long term care facilities. The emergence of the omicron variant in November 2021 raised concerns for long term care populations, with early evidence suggesting increased transmissibility, greater risk of reinfection, and reduced vaccine protection against omicron compared with previous variants of concern.141516 Additionally, susceptibility to infection increased owing to omicron\u2019s partial immune evasion and to waning immunity after the third vaccine dose.1517 To mitigate another surge in covid-19 related morbidity and mortality, Ontario began offering a fourth (second booster) vaccine dose on 30 December 2021 to long term care residents who had received their third dose at least three months previously (\u226584 days).15 The preferred product was a 100 \u03bcg dose of mRNA-1273 (Spikevax; Moderna).15 The four dose schedule for long term care facilities in Ontario was a universal one, aimed at vaccinating all residents as quickly as possible, rather than a targeted or tiered programme, such as prioritising highest risk residents first. Other jurisdictions have subsequently recommended a fourth (second booster) vaccine dose for their long term care populations. Although evidence from Israel suggests that a fourth dose compared with a third dose provides additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 among older adults, findings have been limited to the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine,1819 and no studies to date have reported both marginal effectiveness and vaccine effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose in long term care populations. We estimated the marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose of mRNA covid-19 vaccine versus a third dose, and the vaccine effectiveness of varying numbers of doses in vaccinated residents compared with an unvaccinated group. For both objectives, we examined infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes related to the omicron variant among residents of long term care facilities in Ontario.\n\nMethods Study design, setting, and population We used a test negative design and linked provincial databases to estimate marginal effectiveness and vaccine effectiveness among residents aged 60 years or older as of 30 December 2021 (date eligible for fourth vaccine dose) across the 626 long term care facilities in Ontario. Residents must have had one or more reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 between 30 December 2021 and 27 April 2022. Testing was commonplace in long term care facilities, and might have been initiated because of active screening (if a resident was experiencing covid-19 symptoms, a resident had been in contact with an individual of known positivity to SARS-CoV-2, or during an outbreak) or passive screening (among asymptomatic people without exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to create an additional layer of protection).20 We excluded residents who received a fourth vaccine dose before 30 December 2021 or had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the past 90 days. Canadian and provincial guidelines recommend mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2) versus other Health Canada approved covid-19 vaccine platforms.1521 Few (n=165) residents received ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria or Covishield; Oxford-AstraZeneca) and none received Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), the other vaccines available in Canada at the time. Therefore, we restricted our study population to those who received mRNA vaccines for all doses. Supplementary figure S1 is a flowchart outlining the exclusion criteria. Given B.1.1.529 (omicron) was the dominant circulating variant of concern during our study period, representing about 80.4% of samples tested on 28 December 2021 and more than 98.8% of samples tested after 30 January 2022,2223 we estimated vaccine effectiveness against omicron only. Omicron was identified by whole genome sequencing or S gene target failure testing; the latter has 99.9% specificity, 99.5% positive predictive value, and 99.7% negative predictive value.24 If information on laboratory screening was unavailable, we assumed those who tested positive were infected with omicron unless the results confirmed B.1.617.2 (delta variant). We excluded residents infected with delta identified by whole genome sequencing or S gene target failure testing. Data sources and outcomes Using unique encoded identifiers, we linked provincial SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing, covid-19 vaccination, and health administrative datasets (see supplementary table S1) and analysed the data at ICES (formerly the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences). Cohorts were created for three outcomes: any infection (SARS-CoV-2 positivity, irrespective of symptoms), symptomatic infection (one or more symptoms consistent with covid-19 that was recorded in the Ontario Laboratories Information System when tested (see supplementary table S2 for details on how symptom status was determined); many tested individuals with symptoms could have been excluded because symptom information was not recorded in the Ontario Laboratories Information System for various reasons), and severe outcomes (hospital admission or death due to, or partially due to, covid-19). Residents who tested positive at least once in a week were considered cases and those testing negative for all tests during that week were considered controls. We sampled cases and controls within each week of the study period so that time of testing was similar between groups. Among cases with multiple occurrences of the same outcome, we selected the first occurrence in the study period. Once an individual became a case, they could not re-enter the study. For controls, we randomly selected one negative test result within each week of the study period. It was possible for controls to later be considered cases if they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during earlier weeks of the study period and tested positive in a subsequent week. For the infection outcomes, the index date was the date of specimen collection, and for severe outcomes, the index date was the earliest of specimen collection date, hospital admission, or death. Covid-19 vaccination We used a centralised province-wide vaccine registry to identify receipt of covid-19 vaccines, and we classified long term care residents on the basis of number of doses received. Groups were stratified on time since the third dose (<84 days, \u226584 days) compared with the index test date to evaluate third doses over time, as well as time since the fourth dose (<7 days, \u22657 days) to account for time to expected immune response.25 Covariates From various databases (see supplementary table S1),26 we obtained information on each resident\u2019s age, sex, public health unit region of residence, week of test, whether they had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 longer than 90 days ago, comorbidities, and whether there was an active SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in their long term care facility. Statistical analysis We calculated means (continuous variables) and frequencies (categorical variables) and compared test negative controls with test positive omicron cases using standardised differences. We also compared those vaccinated with a third dose 84 or more days before their index test with those who received no doses, one dose, two doses, or three doses less than 84 days previously, four doses less than seven days previously, or four doses seven or more days previously. We also examined descriptive facility level statistics across the 10 public health unit regions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, comparing the odds of vaccination among cases with the odds of vaccination among controls, while adjusting for covariates. We accounted for clustering at the facility level using a generalised estimating equations framework with an exchangeable correlation structure. The formula 1\u2212odds ratio\u00d7100% was used to estimate marginal effectiveness and vaccine effectiveness. Geographical region was the only variable with missing data, with few observations missing (0.3%); we removed these observations from the analyses. In the primary analysis for marginal effectiveness, we compared the effectiveness less than seven days and seven or more days after a fourth dose with a third dose received 84 or more days previously, and we included all covariates previously listed except for outbreak in the long term care facility. Age was included as a categorical variable (60-69 years, 70-79 years, \u226580 years) and the number of comorbidities as an ordinal variable. We conducted several secondary analyses: adjusted for outbreaks in long term care facilities to determine if outbreak status was a confounder (that is, a facility level outbreak might affect the vaccination and outcome status of some residents); stratified by outbreaks in long term care facilities to determine if being in an outbreak modified the effect of fourth vaccine doses on marginal effectiveness; used a third dose received less than 84 days previously as the comparator group (ie, non-exposed to the intervention of interest, a fourth dose); restricted to the peak period of omicron related infections in long term care facilities; did not adjust for residents who had a previous SARS-CoV-2 positive test result more than 90 days ago; and removed long term care facilities with \u226510% residents classified as unvaccinated to assess the impact of potential misclassification of vaccination status (eg, due to incomplete reporting to the provincial vaccine registry) in these facilities. In the primary analysis for vaccine effectiveness, we estimated the effectiveness of two, three, or four vaccine doses compared with no vaccine doses (unvaccinated group) using the same covariates as for the marginal effectiveness analysis. We also determined the impact of potential misclassification of vaccination status on vaccine effectiveness by removing long term care facilities where \u226510% of residents were unvaccinated. Additionally, we estimated vaccine effectiveness for the most frequently occurring combinations of vaccine products among those who received a third dose (variability by product was insufficient to explore this for the fourth dose): three doses of mRNA-1273, three doses of BNT162b2, and two doses of BNT162b2 followed by one dose of mRNA-1273. Finally, we determined whether the product combination of the first three doses affected the marginal effectiveness of fourth doses of mRNA-1273. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All tests were two sided and we used a significance level of P<0.05. Patient and public involvement Although study participants contributed in important ways to this research, it was not feasible to involve them effectively in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of our research owing to time constraints. Similarly, we did not involve members of the public in this research.\n\nResults Between 30 December 2021 and 27 April 2022, 87.8% of residents (64 339 of 73 291) in long term care facilities in Ontario were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Across all 10 public health unit regions a high proportion of long term care residents were tested (median range 89-97%), and the median facility level SARS-CoV-2 test percentage positivity ranged from 1.8% to 5.9% by region over the study period (see supplementary table S3 and figure S2). After exclusions, 61 344 residents were included in this study (supplementary figure S1). Among those tested, we included 13 654 residents who tested positive for the omicron variant and 205 862 test negative controls. More than three quarters (80.1%) of tested residents had multiple SARS-CoV-2 tests during the study period (mean number 3.6 (standard deviation 2.4) tests per resident; see supplementary figure S3) and 9.4% of residents were immunocompromised owing to illness or treatment. At the time of testing, most of the residents who tested positive (58.1%) and the test negative controls (53.3%) had only received three covid-19 vaccine doses, and a greater proportion of controls (38.2%) than test positive residents (28.0%) had received a fourth dose (table 1). More cases lived in a facility with an active outbreak than controls (65.5% v 51.1%) and fewer had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days ago compared with controls (7.5% v 15.6%). We observed few differences between residents who received a third dose 84 or more days previously and residents who were unvaccinated or received any other number of doses (table 2, see supplementary table S4). The mean number of comorbidities reported among vaccinated residents was similar to that reported among unvaccinated residents (see supplementary table S5).

Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: Table 2 Descriptive characteristics of long term care residents tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 30 December 2021 and 27 April 2022 in Ontario, Canada, comparing those who received a third dose 84 or more days previously with those who received a third dose less than 84 days previously or a fourth dose. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: Compared with residents who received a third vaccine dose 84 or more days before being tested, the marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose seven days or more after vaccination was 19% (95% confidence interval 12% to 26%) against infection, 31% (20% to 41%) against symptomatic infection, and 40% (24% to 52%) against severe outcomes; estimates were lower if the fourth dose was received less than seven days previously (fig 1, see supplementary table S6). Estimates remained unchanged after adjustment and stratification for covid-19 outbreaks (19-22% against infection, 26-28% against symptomatic infection, and 34-40% against severe disease; see supplementary table S7). However, the model for symptomatic infection, when a long term care facility did not have an active covid-19 outbreak, did not converge. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose seven days or more after vaccination versus a third dose received less than 84 days previously was 16% (95% confidence interval 9% to 23%) against infection, 20% (3% to 33%) against symptomatic infection, and 29% (8% to 46%) against severe outcomes (see supplementary figure S4 and table S6). The marginal effectiveness estimates after removing long term care facilities with \u226510% unvaccinated residents (see supplementary table S8), when restricted to the peak period of omicron infections in long term care facilities (30 December 2021 to 26 January 2022; see supplementary table S9; supplementary figure S5 shows an epidemic curve of all positive test results over the study period), and when not adjusting for residents who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days previously (see supplementary table S10) were similar to the findings of the primary analysis. Fig 1 Marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose of mRNA covid-19 vaccine against omicron variant related outcomes among long term care residents in Ontario, Canada, compared with residents who received a third dose 84 or more days previously Vaccine effectiveness in vaccinated residents compared with unvaccinated residents increased with each additional dose of vaccine but was lower for those who received a third dose 84 or more days before testing compared with those who received a third dose more recently (fig 2, see supplementary table S11). Vaccine effectiveness for a fourth dose seven days or more after vaccination was higher against infection (49%, 43% to 54%), symptomatic infection (69%, 61% to 76%), and severe outcomes (86%, 81% to 90%) than the corresponding estimates for a third dose received 84 or more days previously (37%, 31% to 43%; 55%, 45% to 64%; and 77%, 69% to 82%, respectively). Estimates for vaccine effectiveness were similar in analyses removing long term care facilities with \u226510% of unvaccinated residents (see supplementary table S12). Fig 2 Vaccine effectiveness of two, three, and four doses of mRNA covid-19 vaccine against omicron variant related outcomes among long term care residents in Ontario, Canada, compared with unvaccinated residents Vaccine effectiveness against infection was similar among residents who received three doses of mRNA-1273 (infection: 44%, 95% confidence interval 38% to 49%; symptomatic infection: 61%, 50% to 69%; severe outcomes: 81%, 74% to 86%) and those who received two doses of BNT162b2 with a third dose of mRNA-1273 (infection: 36%, 28% to 44%; symptomatic infection: 57%, 40% to 69%; severe outcomes: 81%, 67% to 89%), although time from vaccination to testing was shorter for the latter schedule (table 3). Vaccine effectiveness was lower among residents who received three doses of BNT162b2 (infection: 32%, 24% to 38%; symptomatic infection: 53%, 39% to 63%; severe outcomes: 77%, 67 to 83%). Almost all long term care residents (95%) who received a fourth dose received mRNA-1273, and vaccine effectiveness against infection and severe outcomes with a fourth dose of mRNA-1273 was similar across all combinations of vaccine products (see supplementary table S13). However, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher among those who received either four doses of mRNA-1273 or three doses of BNT162b2 followed by one dose of mRNA-1273 compared with those who received two doses of BNT162b2 followed by two doses of mRNA-1273. Few residents received the last of these vaccination schedules, and confidence intervals were wide and overlapped with other schedules, making it difficult for conclusions to be drawn. Table 3 Vaccine effectiveness of three doses of mRNA covid-19 vaccines against omicron variant related outcomes by vaccine product among long term care residents in Ontario, Canada, compared with unvaccinated residents View this table:\n\nDiscussion In this study of older residents of long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada, we found that compared with a third dose of mRNA vaccine received 84 or more days previously, a fourth dose offered increased effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection (19%), symptomatic infection (31%), and severe outcomes (40%) related to the omicron variant. Marginal effectiveness against all outcomes was lower when comparing fourth doses with third doses received less than 84 days previously, which broadly supports a three month minimum interval between third and fourth doses, although the optimal dosing interval remains unknown. Whether the long term care facility experienced an outbreak of covid-19 at the time of testing neither confounded nor modified marginal effectiveness estimates. Vaccine effectiveness estimates (compared with unvaccinated residents) against infection (49%), symptomatic infection (69%), and severe outcomes (86%) related to the omicron variant were consistently higher for a fourth dose than for a third dose received 84 or more days previously. Few studies to date have explored the effect of the fourth dose of covid-19 vaccines. In Israel, among adults aged 60 years or older, the marginal effectiveness 7-30 days after a fourth dose versus a third dose of BNT162b2 received four or more months earlier was 45% against any infection, 55% against symptomatic infection, 68% against hospital admission, and 74% against death.27 In our study we also found that a fourth dose was associated with additional protection compared with a third dose; however, our marginal effectiveness estimates were lower than those observed in Israel. Nevertheless, findings cannot be directly compared owing to differences in study design, outcome definitions, population characteristics, settings, vaccine products, time since vaccination, and dosing intervals. Notably, the study from Israel excluded residents of long term care facilities. We observed higher vaccine effectiveness with each dose for all outcomes. When interpreting marginal effectiveness estimates, differences in vaccine effectiveness between doses should be taken into consideration.28 Although the marginal effectiveness estimate against infection might seem low at 19%, vaccine effectiveness was 12 percentage points higher (49% v 37%) seven or more days after a fourth dose compared with a third dose received 84 or more days previously. Against symptomatic infection, a marginal effectiveness of 31% corresponded to a 14 percentage point difference in vaccine effectiveness (69% v 55%). A boost in vaccine effectiveness against infection among long term care residents is still important because the consequences of infection, including extended social isolation, disruptions to care, risk of severe disease, and mortality, are higher than among the general population.1229 The difference in vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes was lower, at 9 percentage points (86% v 77%), but nonetheless translated to a 40% marginal effectiveness.28 Given the high baseline incidence of severe outcomes in this population,25 if SARS-CoV-2 transmission is high, a 9 percentage point increase in vaccine effectiveness might still reduce covid-19 related morbidity and mortality substantially. For example, if the incidence of severe outcomes among unvaccinated long term care residents is 10 per 1000 resident weeks, vaccine effectiveness from a fourth dose is 86%, and vaccine effectiveness from a third dose is 77%, then vaccinating all residents who had received a third dose 84 or more days previously with a fourth dose would avert 0.9 severe outcomes per 1000 resident weeks (ie, 2.3 per 1000 resident weeks minus 1.4 per 1000 resident weeks). If the baseline incidence is 100 per 1000 resident weeks, fourth doses administered to all residents would avert nine severe outcomes per 1000 resident weeks. Past studies of vaccine effectiveness of two doses of mRNA vaccines in long term care populations conducted earlier in the pandemic have reported higher vaccine effectiveness estimates (71-82%) against infection compared with the estimates we observed for fourth doses.3031 However, vaccine effectiveness studies conducted later against predominating variants of concern have reported similar estimates to our fourth dose estimates against the omicron variant; two dose vaccine effectiveness against beta infection in long term care facilities in France was 49% and against delta infection in US facilities was 53%.1232 Vaccine effectiveness against omicron, particularly against infection, has also been found to be lower than for any previous variant of concern.163334 Our vaccine effectiveness estimate against hospital admission or death was similar to two dose vaccine effectiveness against similar outcomes due to the beta variant in France (86%).12 Vaccine effectiveness estimates might also be slightly lower in our study because we reported estimates for a longer time after vaccination (ie, up to three months), and protection may have already started waning among residents who received a vaccine dose shortly after implementation of the programme. Nonetheless, our observed increases in vaccine effectiveness with a fourth dose were still considerable for a vulnerable population at high risk of severe outcomes and living in a setting with increased risks of transmission. Similar to recent studies outside Ontario among adult populations,333536 we also observed waning of a third dose based on lower vaccine effectiveness estimates for residents who received a third dose 84 or more days previously versus less than 84 days previously, but not enough time has elapsed to explore waning or duration of protection of fourth doses among residents of long term care facilities in Ontario. Recent studies in Israel among adults aged 60 years or older suggest that effectiveness of the fourth dose of BNT162b2 against infection may wane faster than the third dose, but similar to third doses, the degree of waning against severe disease is lower.1819 Canadian studies have found that immune protection among long term care residents wanes much faster than among younger, healthier adults after two doses; similar patterns might be expected for booster doses.3738 Studies from the United Kingdom among adults suggest similar levels of protection from a third dose of either mRNA vaccine against symptomatic omicron infection irrespective of the mRNA product used for the primary series.1636 Among adults aged 65 years or older in the UK, vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission was also similar for a third dose of either mRNA vaccine after two doses of BNT162b2.39 We found that among Ontario long term care residents, a third dose of mRNA-1273 after a homologous two dose primary series of either mRNA vaccine was more effective against all outcomes than three doses of BNT162b2. For those receiving a primary course of BNT162b2 with an mRNA-1273 booster, the time between vaccination and testing was shorter compared with the other schedules, making it difficult to determine the relative impact of the booster product versus the shorter period. Additionally, a 100 \u03bcg dose of mRNA-1273 is now recommended as the booster for long term care residents in Ontario,1540 whereas other jurisdictions (eg, UK41 and US42) use a 50 \u03bcg dose for boosters, which could have influenced our findings. Strengths and limitations of this study This study has some limitations. Firstly, our cohort assessing symptomatic infection was limited to residents with symptoms recorded in the Ontario Laboratories Information System and therefore might be incomplete. Secondly, Ontario laboratories discontinued routine screening using S gene target failure testing of all positive samples in late December 2021, therefore some cases with the delta variant might be misclassified as having the omicron variant, potentially biasing estimates away from the null. It is, however, unlikely that this would affect our estimates considerably because the prevalence of the delta variant was low in Ontario during our study period. Thirdly, we classified outbreaks at the facility level because we did not have data on whether the outbreak was on a resident\u2019s floor or if it was more contained; therefore, we could have overestimated the impact of outbreaks at the individual level. Fourthly, residual confounding is possible because we were limited to the covariates available in the study databases. Fifthly, information was not available on why residents might have delayed or refused vaccination, which could have introduced some bias. Finally, we did not have access to staff vaccination records in the long term care facilities. Staff vaccination strongly influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in long term care facilities.43 At the time of this study, all staff working in long term care facilities in Ontario were required to be vaccinated with two doses of a covid-19 vaccine,44 but two dose vaccine effectiveness against omicron infection is low.163334 Although a mandate for required third doses was also implemented, staff had until 14 March 2022 (well into our study period) to comply (although this might not have been enforced because the province shifted from a provincial long term care vaccination mandate to supporting employer led policies on the same day).44 This study also has many strengths, such as its test negative design, which helps mitigate selection bias from differences in healthcare seeking behaviours between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and our large sample size. Our study included more than 60 000 residents across all 626 long term care facilities in Ontario, increasing the generalisability of these findings. Conclusions Our findings indicate that a fourth dose of a covid-19 mRNA vaccine (95% of our study participants received mRNA-1273) successfully increased protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes among long term care residents in an omicron dominant period. Nevertheless, many unknowns about fourth doses still remain in this population, including the duration of protection, particularly for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Layering other public health measures with vaccination in long term care facilities, including mask wearing, increased ventilation, and physical distancing might help optimise protection against SARS-CoV-2 for this highly vulnerable population. What is already known on this topic Real world effectiveness studies among adults aged \u226560 years in Israel suggest that a fourth dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) provides considerable additional protection against infection with the omicron variant and severe covid-19 compared with a third dose received four or more months previously What this study adds? Among long term care residents in Ontario, Canada, a fourth dose of an mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine was associated with increased protection against omicron infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes compared with a third dose, particularly if the third dose was received three or more months previously; 95% of residents received mRNA-1273 as their fourth dose\n\nCompared with unvaccinated residents, vaccine effectiveness increased with each additional dose of an mRNA vaccine, and a fourth dose provided strong protection against severe outcomes due to the omicron variant\n\nEthics statements Ethical approval ICES is a prescribed entity under Ontario\u2019s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA).
