        "by Kit Knightly, Off Guardian:\n\nCovid is back in every headline. As the new normal crowd get desperate to scare people into accepting the Great Reset they’re going back to their old favourite to get us used to the forever pandemic.\n\nThe UK’s “Covid cases” are (apparently) up to 3.8 million, according to the Office of National Statistics. It’s reportedly just as bad in the EU, where “cases” (allegedly) tripled in six weeks.\n\nThing’s are looking pretty grim across the pond too, with “cases” “surging” all across the US."

        "by Megan Redshaw, Childrens Health Defense:\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, today told the superintendent of schools for the District of Columbia that CHD will sue the school district unless it rescinds its recently announced COVID-19 vaccine mandate for students ages 12 and up.\n\nSchools in Washington, D.C., will require all students ages 12 and older to get the COVID-19 vaccine before they can attend school in the fall, despite warnings from legal experts who say the mandate violates federal law.\n\nThe Office of the State Superintendent of Education announced on July 19 that student immunization requirements for the upcoming 2022-2023 school year will include the COVID-19 vaccine for all students who are of an age for which there is a vaccine fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n“On July 8, 2022, the FDA fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine commonly known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for individuals 12 to 15 years old,” said State Superintendent of Education Christina Grant in a press release.\n\n“The approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 12 to 15 means that, unless exempted, any student age 12-15 at the start of the 2022-23 school year must have received the primary COVID-19 vaccine series or have started receiving the shot by Sept. 16, 2022,” she said.\n\n“We want to make sure that all of our students have everything they need for a healthy start to the school year,” Grant added. “This means making sure children see their primary medical provider for a well-child visit and receive all needed immunizations.”\n\nD.C. law requires students in all area schools, including private, parochial and independent schools, to be fully compliant with mandated vaccinations, unless they have an approved exemption. The law also requires schools to verify immunization certification for all students.\n\nThe requirement was detailed in a law the D.C. Council approved last year and is the first legislation of its kind in the region.\n\nCHD demands D.C. Schools rescind mandate\n\nIn a letter sent today to Grant, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), asked Grant to rescind the program or CHD would sue to overturn the mandate.\n\nKennedy said Grant’s press release was incorrect because the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was never fully approved and still remains under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nThe FDA earlier this month granted full approval to Pfizer’s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 15 years old, without convening its vaccine advisory panel.\n\nIn August 2021, the agency granted full licensing of the Comirnaty vaccine for ages 16 and older.\n\nHowever, there are no Comirnaty-labeled vaccines available in the U.S., for any age group.\n\nAlthough courts have upheld many childhood vaccination requirements for licensed and approved vaccines, no court has ever upheld a mandate for schoolchildren for an EUA vaccine, according to Kennedy.\n\nKennedy wrote:\n\n“In fact, a District of Columbia United States District Court held that EUA vaccines cannot be mandated to soldiers in the U.S. military, who enjoy far fewer rights than civilians. Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld, 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003). That court held: ‘… the United States cannot demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs.’ Id. at 135.\n\n“Federal law 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) requires that the person to whom an EUA vaccine is administered be advised, ‘of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.’\n\n“The reason for the right of refusal stems from the fact that EUA products are by definition experimental.\n\n“Under the Nuremberg Code, a universal legal norm, no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is ‘absolutely essential.’ The liability for forced participation in a medical experiment, not to mention liability for injury from such coerced medical intervention, may be incalculable.”\n\nCommenting on the D.C. mandate, CHD President Mary Holland said, “It violates fundamental human rights and international law to force people, and especially children, to take experimental medical products.”\n\n“We sincerely hope the District will reconsider its misguided policy for schoolchildren,” Holland added.\n\nAnother organization — Liberty Counsel — said it may also challenge the District of Columbia’s vaccine mandate.\n\n“There is no FDA-approved COVID shot available and therefore, individuals have a right under the emergency use authorization to refuse these shots,” Matthew Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, told The Epoch Times.\n\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, people receiving an EUA product must be advised that some benefits and risks “are unknown” and given the “option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”\n\n“It is your choice to receive or not receive [the vaccine],” Staver said. “Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care,” according to FDA fact sheets on EUA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nRead More @ ChildrensHealthDefense.org"

        "One thing we know for sure – every single person can help our country control the COVID-19 pandemic. From wearing a mask to washing our hands to maintaining social distancing and avoiding large indoor gatherings, each of us can follow proven public health practices that can reduce our chance of getting infected by COVID-19 and prevent the spread of COVID-19 to our families and friends.\n\nAnother thing that will help is COVID-19 testing as many people as possible.\n\nScientists across the world are working hard to establish programs that will help give access to rapid and reliable COVID-19 testing around the world. Testing for COVID-19 can help people determine if they are infected, asymptomatic carriers, or whether they are at risk of spreading the infection to others.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to articulate why testing for COVID-19 is necessary, important, and achievable.\n\nCOVID-19 Testing Saves Lives\n\nCOVID-19 testing everyone including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection, and those who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who require care ASAP. A positive COVID-19 test early in the course of the illness will help individuals isolate themselves, thus reducing the chances that they will infect others and allowing them to look for treatment earlier, therefore reducing disease spread, severity, and the risk of long-term disability, or in worst cases, death.\n\nCOVID-19 testing of people who have been in close contact with others is also important. A negative COVID-19 test doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. So even if you test negative, you need to continue to protect yourself and others by continuing to washing your hands regularly, socially distancing, and wearing a face mask properly. A positive COVID-19 test means that you have to strictly isolate yourself. Make sure that others you have been in close contact or interaction with in the past fourteen days should also go get tested.\n\nTesting for COVID-19 Can Be Quick, Easy, And Hassle-free\n\nBefore, the only COVID-19 test available requires getting a sample from the back of your throat.\n\nNew developments have provided a better solution that is equally as accurate as the previous COVID-19 test. This COVID-19 test obtains the sample from inside the nose. Large-scale uses are COVID-19 tests that will use a simple mouth swab or a saliva sample to get results.\n\nA positive COVID-19 test lets the individual know that they have the infection. Not only can they get treated faster, but they can take the necessary steps to stop or minimize the spread.\n\nThis is why it is so important to get the test results quickly, ideally within a few hours or less.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, there wasn’t enough capacity and there were only limited supplies and facilities to collect and process the tests, which often resulted in tons of both minor and major delays. But nowadays, facilities and equipment have improved, and the capacity and supply have expanded exponentially, and the results are being returned, on average, within 3-4 days. There are COVID-19 tests that can provide same-day results COVID-19 testing!\n\n3. COVID-19 Testing Matters More in The Communities Affected the Most\n\nMinority communities are unreasonably burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most individuals in these communities are essential workers, who cannot work from home, thus increasing their risk of being exposed to the virus. Comorbid conditions that worsen the already terrible health risks of COVID-19, such as heart diseases, obesity, and diabetes, are also more common in these communities because of multiple societal and environmental factors. Therefore, COVID-19 can spread fairly quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is intense. COVID-19 testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is one of the keys to putting a stop to this continuous spread.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s still a lot of confusion about who should get tested and where to go get tested. It’s common to be unaware of local testing locations near you. Frequently asked questions such as:\n\n“I have no idea if there are any testing locations near me! Where should I go to find a COVID-19 rapid testing near me or a PCR test near me?”\n\nYou can try to contact your local health authorities to find more information on COVID-19 testing locations near you.\n\nIt is clear that for a person to test positive, they have to have a significant amount of the COVID-19 virus in their system. It only means that if you have no symptoms but you know or were told that you were in contact with a person infected with COVID-19, isolate yourself immediately, contact local health authorities, and go get tested.\n\nCOVID-19 testing is as ESSENTIAL as staying informed.\n\nIn the meantime, let’s all continue to protect ourselves and our loved ones from getting infected. Go get tested if you believe you have been in contact with someone with COVID-19."

        "By Dr. Kevin Barrett\n\nThe American people, polarized as never before, can hardly agree on anything. Between the hysteria purveyed by legacy fake news media on the left, and Fox News and “alternative facts” on the right, the mainstream political discussion is a nonstop shouting match. (And yes, I realize that alternative facts are sometimes more factual than mainstream ones.)\n\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan’s witticism, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,” has never been more apropos. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be nice to have some trustworthy facts. Unfortunately, many of the establishment’s key claims are debatable. Where, when, and how did Covid-19 emerge? Are the tests accurate? How many cases are there? How many actual deaths have occurred from Covid-19? Do lockdowns and masks really work? What are the most promising medications? Should ventilators be used, and if so, when? Could a safe and effective vaccine be devised quickly enough to help? The World Health Organization, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other establishment bureaucracies offer answers to these questions. But their answers often raise even more questions.\n\nThe U.S. claim that Covid-19 emerged naturally in October from animals at a Wuhan market is almost certainly wrong, for too many reasons to list here. The mandate to “test, test, test” is questionable given the dubious reliability of the tests. For that reason and others, nobody knows how many cases exist. Likewise, it isn’t always clear which deaths are Covid deaths; the official counts may be too low or too high, depending on whom you believe. Likewise, the efficacy of masks is debatable, as is the question of whether a “cocktail” including hydroxychloroquine and zinc, or vitamins C and/or D3, could be useful treatments. And the sensitive issue of whether ventilators have been saving patients or killing them is far from settled. Finally, the prospect of a workable vaccine, despite the billions of dollars being thrown at it, is uncertain to say the least.\n\nSo, do we know anything about Covid-19? Do we even know there is a real pandemic out there? Yes, we do. The best metric, the one least likely to be wrong, is the excess death rate: the difference between the number of deaths expected to occur in a given time frame, and the number of deaths that actually occur. Though it may not always be clear whether someone died of Covid, with Covid, or of something else that could be mistaken for Covid, the fact that the person is dead is “dead certain.” Procedures for counting deaths are far more accurate than, say, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for counting viruses.\n\nWhat do overall death counts tell us? First takeaway: Prior to March 20, 2020, there were no discernable excess deaths in the U.S. Then suddenly, during the last 10 days in March, the overall death count shot up, peaking during the first two weeks of April, then quickly declining back to zero by mid-May. So, April, as\n\nTS Eliot said in another context, was indeed the cruelest month. (As of this writing, statistics for June are not yet available; but since reported Covid deaths are not keeping pace with reported new cases, it seems likely that the overall death count remained fairly flat in June.)\n\nThe spike in excess deaths in April supports the establishment narrative in some ways, but also raises questions. It confirms that Covid-19 spread wildly in February and early March, leading to the spike in April deaths. It also confirms that the March and April lockdowns were presumably effective in slowing the spread of the virus, so that by mid-May there were no more discernable excess deaths in America.\n\nBut wait! Officially, there were roughly 15,000 “confirmed Covid deaths” between May 15 and June 1. Yet as we have seen, there seem to have been no overall excess deaths. Did 15,000 people who would have died otherwise somehow survive thanks to the Covid pandemic, balancing out the 15,000 Covid deaths? That seems unlikely.\n\nBut it may be that the Covid emergency is somehow saving at least some lives—especially the lives of young children. According to official statistics, “Starting in early March, expected deaths (of children) began a sharp decline, from an expected level of around 700 deaths per week to well under 500 by mid April and throughout May.” Has the drastic drop in childhood vaccinations been saving kids’ lives? Or are infants receiving more and better attention from parents who are staying home rather than working?\n\nBottom line: The Covid pandemic, and the bungling and confusing official response, has raised far more questions than answers. Those who want cold, hard facts should keep an eye on excess death statistics.\n\nKevin Barrett, Ph.D., is an Arabist-Islamologist scholar and one of America’s best-known critics of the War on Terror. From 1991 through 2006, Dr. Barrett taught at colleges and universities in San Francisco, Paris, and Wisconsin. In 2006, however, he was attacked by Republican state legislators who called for him to be fired from his job at the University of Wisconsin-Madison due to his political opinions. Since 2007, Dr. Barrett has been informally blacklisted from teaching in American colleges and universities. He currently works as a nonprofit organizer, public speaker, author, and talk radio host. He lives in rural western Wisconsin."

        "Three years into the global COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are still learning more about how the virus impacts the body. Now, there’s a new finding: COVID-19 is linked to brain damage.\n\nThat’s the major takeaway from a new study published in the journal . For the study, researchers analyzed data from 401 patients aged 51 to 81 who underwent brain scans before they contracted COVID-19 and months after they were infected. Their scans, which were conducted about three years apart, were compared to those of 384 people who weren’t infected with COVID-19, but had similar characteristics like age, sex, medical history, and socioeconomic status to those who did contract the virus.\n\nThe researchers noted that it’s normal to lose some gray matter each year, which helps control movement, memory, and emotions. But patients who had COVID-19—who had a second brain scan about 4.5 months after they were infected—had more gray matter loss than those who didn’t have the virus, losing between 0.2 and 2% extra gray matter in different brain regions between their two scans. They also lost more brain volume and showed more tissue damage in certain areas, including those linked to the sense of smell, than those who never had the virus.\n\nMost of the study participants were never hospitalized with COVID-19 (only 15 of them were), and the researchers noted that the trend in brain changes was still seen when the hospitalized patients were excluded from the findings.\n\nWhether you’ve had COVID-19, love someone who has had the virus, or are just curious, it’s understandable to have questions about what’s going on. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhy might COVID-19 cause brain damage?\n\nIt’s not entirely clear, but the researchers said in an FAQ they shared online that it seems to linked to loss of smell. “It is known that areas of the brain that are not being used can atrophy, so it will be important to understand how much of this may be related to loss of smell,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who did not work on the study.\n\n“Another explanation could be the effect of the virus itself, either because it invades the brain, or because it causes inflammation or immune reactions,” the researchers wrote. However, they added, “it is still unclear why such invasion or inflammatory/immune reactions should be mainly seen in specific regions of the brain, but not others.”\n\nWhat kind of symptoms can people experience from this?\n\nThe researchers didn’t explore this. However, they did have study participants take cognitive tests around attention and efficiency in doing something complex. That showed that, on average, there was “larger cognitive decline” in people who were infected than those who were not infected, the researchers wrote.\n\n“When you have inflammation in the brain from whatever cause, it can cause symptoms,” says Santosh Kesari, M.D., Ph.D., neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and regional medical director for the Research Clinical Institute of Providence Southern California. But Dr. Kesari says it’s “unusual” to see changes in brain matter volume after having a virus. That, he says, “means there's a pretty severe inflammation going on.”\n\nThe actual symptoms depend on the area of the brain that’s impacted, he says. But, given that this seems to be tied to areas of the brain that are linked to smell and taste, Dr. Kesari says it makes sense that the loss or change of these senses would be symptoms.\n\nAmit Sachdev, M.D., M.S., medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University, agrees and says that this can have big implications for people. “Smell is important for taste and for threat recognition,” he says. “Without smell, food can be very bland. Also, some safety measures that use smell to alert for a problem won’t work. The most commonly cited example is being able to smell the ‘rotten egg’ smell added to natural gas. If you can't smell, you might not be able to detect a natural gas leak.”\n\nCan COVID cause other neurological disorders?\n\nThis is still being explored. However, Dr. Adalja points out that COVID-19 has been linked to a few other neurological health conditions, including:\n\nNew loss of taste and smell\n\nStrokes\n\nPeripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness, and pain from nerve damage)\n\nGuillain-Barre Syndrome (an autoimmune disorder where a person's immune system damages the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis)\n\nEncephalitis (inflammation of the brain that can be caused by a virus or bacteria)\n\nFatigue and body tingling can also happen as a result of COVID-19, Dr. Sachdev says, adding, “we have seen many patients with these long-term complications.”\n\nHow long does COVID-19 affect the brain?\n\nThat’s also unclear. The researchers noted that they have no clue how long these brain changes will last. “Whether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow up,” they wrote.\n\nBut it’s possible that people can regain at least some of their brain health over time. “Once damaged, the brain can recover but the recovery tends to be incomplete,” Dr. Sachdev says. “Brain injury is permanent. The area that is damaged can't regrow.\" Still, he says, “brain plasticity allows for some recovery.” Dr. Sachdev says that it’s possible that people can regain their sense of smell afterward “but that smell might not be the same as before the infection.”\n\nIf you’re still having unusual symptoms after having COVID-19, Dr. Kesari recommends seeing your doctor for an evaluation. But, he points out, doctors are still learning more about the after-effects of having COVID-19. “There is further work that needs to be done,” he says. “There may be additional treatments to help the brain recover better, but we need more research.”\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly evolves and the scientific community’s understanding of the novel coronavirus develops, some of the information may have changed since it was last updated.

        "If you’re feeling the fatigue of navigating the news during COVID you’re not alone. I personally know a lot of people who feel this way. But given what has happened over the last few years through the decision making of government, is how a good time to stop paying attention? This is a tough question, because in many ways it’s healthy to know when to say enough, but when the stakes are as high as they are now, surely we have to stay in the game no?\n\n\n\nMy Guests today are Dr Madhava Setty and David Helfrich. Madhava is a physician who has been actively engeged in examining and reporting on COVID related literature since the onset of the pandemic, and David is a lawyer who has been curiously reflecting on the nature of COVID restrictions and their affect on rights, as well as much of COVID literature in general.\n\nWe’ll talk about COVID news fatigue, the value of information, some key takeaways we must consider when looking at the COVID era, and as always we’ll get into a deeper set of philosophical and metaphysical questions asking whether COVID has applied an evolutionary pressure for the consciousness of humanity.\n\nDownload Episode here"

They are both recovering in the hospital and doing well. Please keep them both in your prayers as they continue to recover and heal.\n\nCarrie has been a good friend to us and is a hero in the world sounding the alarm about the COVID shots and the transhumanism agenda the globalists are rolling out without our express knowledge through the COVID shot. If it weren’t for Dr Carrie and others like her, we would be in the dark about the science and ingredients and their very dangerous effects on the human body. Thank you, Carrie, for your service to humanity.\n\nPlease enjoy this video presentation of Dr Carrie Madej speaking at our most recent TTAC Live Event 2021 in Nashville, Tn where she talks about “The COVID-19 Injections – A Gateway to Transhumanism?”\n\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nOur afternoon keynote speaker was originally from Dearborn, Michigan. She received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences. She then completed her traditional internship at The Medical Center in Columbus, Georgia, and internal medicine residency at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. She served as a private clinician and medical director of multiple clinics in Georgia till 2015, also served as an attending physician for the Pennsylvania College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nCharlene Bollinger:\n\nShe has served as a public speaker and has been featured in the documentary The Marketing of Madness about the overuse of prescriptions psychotropic medicines, and she has now dedicated her life in educating others about vaccine, nanotechnology, and human rights. She’s become a good friend. I’ve spoken with her on a few different occasions. She’s a dear, dear soul, and I personally am looking forward to hearing our good friend, Dr. Carrie Madej.\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nGive it up for Carrie Madej.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThank you so much. It’s so exciting for me to be here today. I’m going to talk about obviously some ugly things that are happening in our world, but remember that we need to be wise as serpents and gentle as doves. And people get scared of the word apocalypse, right? But we shouldn’t because literally the word apocalypse means lifting of the veil. We are seeing now what has been unseen. These ugly things that are going on right now are for a purpose. It is for us to finally remember who we are and what we are. It really is about returning back to who we are, which is we have a royal birthright, a divinity right with God, Yeshua, our savior.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo, transhumanism. If you don’t know this word, you need to know it. Everybody in the world should know this because it is my belief that these injections they falsely call vaccines are the gateway to transhumanism and that’s why we’re going through this chaos. You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, right? So let’s get started.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThe most important question you should ever ask yourself is what does it mean to be human? Because right now, the future of humankind is at stake. They want to turn us into something called human 2.0, and I personally am against it. So you need to know what is going on. So Ray Kurzweil, he’s one of the big wigs of Google, he’s a transhumanist. He says, we are all, not just a couple of people, we are all going to be a hybrid. This is the most pivotal point in human history. We are alive for this time. And I know I was born here to be for this moment, weren’t you?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo, transhumanism. What is that? That is literally the melding of artificial intelligence with the human body. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but it’s doable and possible if we allow it to happen. It’s also about manipulating the human genetics, that God-given code. So just so you know how precious your genome is, it is in one person, if you unraveled it, it would extend out to 10 billion miles, one human being. That is a wonderful living language. You can read it like a book. It can actually be read as a binary code.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so people now in this transhumanist field, they believe that the human body is broken and fragile. We’re going to fix that. We’re going to take evolving humanity into our own hands. These people right now think that and they are executing their plan. So this says scientists propose putting nanobots in our bodies to create a global super brain. Isn’t it selling something from the worst sci-fi movie ever? We’re living it right now, guys. So you can’t get distracted by what the television is telling you. It’s tell a vision. It’s programming you. Turn it off, never turn it back on again and you will become smarter already.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo again, Ray Kurzweil, we all know this man. He says, we’re just a few breakthroughs from achieving eternal life. Again, what these people are doing, listen, they are atheists. They do not believe in God our Father in heaven. They will tell you that. Even Ray Kurzweil says, somebody asked him, “Is there a God?” He said, “No, but soon there will be one.” Craig Venter, another transhumanist, they asked him, “What is God?” He said, “Well, God creates. Now, I can create, we can create. Now we’re gods.” You need to know those are the pushers of this agenda. They are the pushers of these injections falsely called vaccines.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo you have to know what they plan. They have a plan for human bodies as you can see here, avatar A, B, C, D. So this is an evolution of going up to 2045. They actually kind of pushed this agenda to 2030, eight years from now, guys. So they want to actually… They think a human being is only memories and dreams. That’s it. Because again, they don’t believe in God. So they think if they upload all of our memories and dreams into the cloud, then they can download them into a new body or robots or a digital avatar like a video game. You have to know what they’re thinking. I know it sounds ludicrous, but you need to know.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo who else is behind this? World Economic Forum, Davos. And if you really want to know what they’re planning, look at the World Economic Forum’s websites. So this is what they’ll tell all of us that 2030 is their goal, guys. So in 2030, it says the average human will own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better, right? They also say on the bottom paragraph here, they’re giving you the description of now, this is their best sell. They’re marketing this to you, okay? They say that in the future, everywhere you go will be registered, there’s no privacy, and every thought and every dream is recorded and monitored. And you hope that none of those dreams, none of those thoughts go against the narrative or you’re in trouble. You will be in trouble for what you dream of. These are these megalomaniacs behind this plan. They plan this for the future of humankind.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo these are very outrageous ideas. So how in the world could they accomplish this really almost eight years now? So you have to know about DARPA. Very important organization to know, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They’re the black ops, the sci-fi kind of portion of the Pentagon. They have public and private funding. And so one of the things you need to know is this substance called hydrogel. Hydrogel is like the mother kind of formula. It’s a sci-fi substance that can do many things. Actually it’s very analogous to the human tissue. So we usually don’t reject it in the body. It can assemble, disassemble, reassemble innumerable times. It can make more of itself in your body. It can meld with the human tissue and be a hybrid with your body, your brain, and your nervous tissue. They’ve used it in military projects already.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo just so you know, an example of that would be, there is a small group of Black Hawk helicopter. It was a project. And when they sat in the aircraft, they’d have to wear a magnetic helmet. And at that moment, all their eye movements and everything they thought, the aircraft would know immediately to do in respond. The aircraft and the person, the pilot was one. And if they had an upgrade, they didn’t have to study. They just sat in the cockpit and then it was downloaded into their brain. They’ve been doing this for decades. So Neil deGrasse Tyson, he’s an astrophysicist, is talking to Ray Kurzweil, the guy we’ve been talking about. So listen to what he says.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson:\n\nIn 20 years, plus or minus, and so the mid 2030s, we will have nanobots that we can feed into our brain that directly connect to the cloud rather than through anything we carry in our pocket. And in that way, wirelessly, we can basically download entire books, entire languages, and we will then know the…\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI’m sorry. All right. Sorry, that cut off a little early, but you’re talking about nanobots. So hydrogel, that magical substance can form nanobots. It can be a drug delivery system. It can be biosensor. It can be a biosensor in your body. So how in the world could they get nanobots in our body? How could they upload everything? How could they know our thoughts? How could they know our dreams? How could they monitor everything? How could this happen? Because they’re doing it right now through these injections falsely called vaccines and they’ve been lying to us from the beginning.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo it is not a vaccine. Never call it a vaccine ever again any of these shots they’re giving to anybody, all right? It’s a brand new technology on the human race. It’s nothing like an old vaccine. Old vaccine takes the actual virus and it’s dead or alive with some toxins, puts it in your body, and your body’s supposed to know how to fight it just a little bit amount, right? No, there is no virus at all that they have documented. There’s over 70 freedom of information acts. Do you know we don’t have the virus on file anywhere in the world? Nobody has it in their lab. This is a little crazy, right? So they couldn’t make the normal way. They had to make a Frankenstein code so that your body produces this. They took proteins, they took this genetic code and mashed it together and had an artificial intelligence program fill in the missing gaps. So it’s artificial intelligence, a synthetic thing that’s not from nature and different kinds of parts of genetic material pushed into one and they are programming your body to make it like a factory.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nWhat’s in the code? We know a little bit. We know that there’s a human protein similar to the body so your body potentially could start attacking itself. It’s so similar. Like autoimmune disorders. HIV-1, did anyone know that? Is that informed consent here? 18 sub-units of HIV-1 are in that code that your body will be producing. What will that do? Chromosome 8 is pretty important. It’s in charge of intelligence and fertility. It’s a potential damaging that. Most important, they’re putting a fake amino acid in your body, not from this world. That beautiful symphony orchestra of how your body is created with that genome that twist and turns, it’s beautiful from God, they’re destroying it with a fake protein. It’s like origami. It won’t twist and fold together again.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThis guy you need to know, Dr. Craig Venter. Never forget that name. This man is behind this transhumanist movement. He’s the brains behind it. And I want you to know that if we have a synthetic gene, which this vaccine has… I’m sorry, injection has synthetic genes in it, if it gets taken up into our human genome, that’s bad because in 2013 in this country, the Supreme Court justice has ruled that any human being can be patented and owned if there’s a synthetic gene inside of them. What? Did you know that? Was that on your CNN, your Fox News? No. Literally overnight, you can be patented and owned. This guy is partly responsible for this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo they didn’t want you to know there was a synthetic gene inside this injection because it’s possible for it to take up into your body. And if it’s taken up, they decided to get credit for their work. They’re so proud of this. Again, they think they’re little creators. They’re gods, right? So they’re putting their names branding you like a cow. 46 scientists are doing this. They’re getting a secret email inside the genome. I guess that’s who you belong to if someone finds you. Also three messages. Can’t figure out those messages yet. Working on that. And also a brand new alphabet. Why alphabet?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nRemember they want to be gods or copying God, but it’s a blasphemy, an inversion of God, okay? They want you to live forever. They want you to always be connected through a hive mind. And also we’re connected with God, right? So frequencies. Like you’re tuning on a radio, they want to switch the channel. They want to switch the station because words are powerful. Remember in the beginning there was the word. Yeah. It’s powerful, guys. See what they’re doing? We know what they’re doing, right? So they’re not going to get away with it.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so this is going back to, yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that a human being can be patented and owned if this synthetic gene gets taken up into your body. And they’re telling us it can’t happen. Absolutely it can happen. They’re lying to you. Absolutely. Right here, this is the modified messenger RNA that they’re using inside of these injections, and this is just one of many research articles showing that our body has the potential to use reverse transcriptase enzyme. Long word. It can take it up into the genome of our genome and then it becomes permanent. It’s a Russian roulette. It’s a chance. It’s like playing Craps. We shouldn’t be doing that with our sovereignty, with our human holy temple, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo Moderna and Pfizer. So everybody tells me, “Okay, I know some of those injections are bad. Okay. Well, what about this one? What about this one?” No, they’re all bad, guys. They’re all putting a fake code inside of your body. Something not from nature that you are producing like a factory. And you know how they’re doing that? They have to suppress your immune checkpoints. They have to suppress your immune system so your body accepts it. For how long will that happen? That means more cancers, more autoimmune disorders, all kinds of things. Do you think they cared? No. They just want their drug inside of your body.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThey also are putting artificial intelligence inside your body. Unbelievable. But it’s just to get the drug delivery system in. So the hydrogel is part of this artificial intelligence system. And they’re like, “Oh, well, we’re not going to use it for bios and we’re not going to do it to spy on you. Don’t worry. We’re just going to put it inside your body just for the drug delivery. But once it’s in your body, don’t worry. We won’t use it for anything else.” Do you believe that? They are liars. They lied from the beginning. We know by Dr. David Martin that… We know where the coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, came from, right? It’s patented 2002. There’s a patent. That means it was made in a lab. Someone’s making money off of it. We know where it came from. It’s not from some bat soup shop, whatever, in China. It’s a lie.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo all of them are the same. Some of them say they’re doing different things. Sometimes they’re using a vector. Vector means they’re using a cold virus that is infecting you purposely and then it’ll inject this genetic material inside of you. Some are just using the hydrogel, right? They’re telling us they’re doing different ways. And I knew this, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I don’t trust them, right? And I’ll show you some photos. So Moderna also says that it’s trying to put an operating system inside of you. An operating system just like Windows. We know Windows is terrible. Viruses all the time, right? They messed up on that. How are they going to make this one good? Impossible. And were you given informed consent? Have they told us about this? No. They’re liars. Again, this is the theme. They’re lying. Satan is the greatest of deceivers, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo with this hydrogel, different things come under hydrogel, nanobots, graphing, magnetic particles, et cetera. But that’s the mother of all of that substance. And just to FYI, hydrogel is the opposite of water life. We’re over 90% water. Water gives life. It freezes when it’s not supposed to freeze. When it freezes, it expands instead of condenses, something very strange. It boils when it’s not supposed to boil. It makes different crystal structures depending on intention, where it comes from. It’s beautiful. It has intelligence in life. Water’s life. Hydrogel is water gel. It sucks the life out. It literally will dry out the water. That is not healthy for any human body. And they want to put nanobots inside of you just like this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd how could they do that? Well, one little syringe needle, one little syringe needle, 1 million can fit in there. And this is one of the symbols of hydrogel. You want to see how it moves inside? This could be assembling, disassembling, reassembling in your body to do innumerable tasks, do innumerable things. I want to show you another nanobot. This is called a TRAP bot, okay? I actually have seen images of this in the vial, somebody whose vials we’re injecting into people.\n\nSpeaker 5:\n\nOrganization-based microrobots or TRAP bots which can capture and transport live cells to a desired location. Much like a spider weaving a web, these microbots can spit out thread-like gel to trap living cells and incorporate them in their hollow microcylinder. This microcylinder is about 200 micrometers in diameter. It also contains the ingredients for these cell trapping gel, which creates a long thread-like structure while [inaudible 00:19:17] allows for magnetic-\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nOkay. So this is just giving you an example of how it can move through the body and what is directing the movement? A magnet or magnet force, a magnetic force. And it’s very minuscule, but I don’t know if you noticed what they’re saying. There’s a long string-like, hair-like substances gel, hydrogel, coming from it that builds, it can actually build and grow as it’s squirming through the body. Hydrogel is also important to know because it can create its own electricity, okay? Think about to build a computer, you need some power. You need electricity. So we are powerful beings, A, and now the hydrogel can produce its own electricity. But remember computers when you have a laptop on your lap and it’s been working for a while, it gets really hot. They have to cool down. So the problem is when something is generating a lot of computing power, how do we cool it down? Oh, don’t worry. Hydrogel can cool itself down. They’ve already thought about this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, hydrogel in a injection with Moderna, Pfizer, et cetera, they’re calling it nanolipid particle. So nanolipid particle is a creative way of saying the same word as hydrogel just so you know. Again, DARPA has their clarity project with hydrogel, and what they’re saying is that they’re so good at it when they inject it into the human body in some of their military experiments, they were able to mold it and make it a hybrid tissue with the brain and the nervous system of the military victim. And so when they did that, they could see through and feel and know what that soldier is thinking like an avatar. Use them as computer simulation game. And they think this is great. So this guy you need to know, he’ll explain about the technology.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\n[crosstalk 00:21:23] the sensory cortex of the second animal and that animal acquires the knowledge. From the human drone technology standpoint, you can attach the human brain to another human brain, you can direct motor activity, or you can send communication and information. Dr. Venter’s work is in my view, the equivalent of the development of nuclear weapons when you realize that he created life in a cell. He programmed yeast cells to produce anything he wanted. These can be inserted into you through the hypospray needles. You put in a specific gene slicing, you program what you like, you put it in the cell and it can reproduce and make as much as you like. It sends a signal and it tells which portion of the DNA should unwrap, unfold, and produce a product.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\nRelated to this is an idea called DREADDs. These are designer receptors that can be remotely controlled. You can create a cell, you can put it somewhere in the body and you can remotely activate it. So you have the capacity to create any product as long as you know the DNA sequence, you can insert it into a living system and you can remotely control it. That may affect the way you think, the way you act. So once you know that the technology is there to edit, splice, and program the cell and the technology currently exists to administer to somebody and have it go park anywhere you program it to go park proliferate and do its function, you can have things activated in other people’s brains.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\nThese people have figured out how to hide imagery in the DNA of bacteria. You can have the information reproduced in a string form as a form of a protein. The new way to hide information is going to be in DNA. This is the first experiment showing what imagery you can hide in bacteria. This is the latest. It’s a GIF file. Well, this is what the Chinese are doing with DNA. Merging DNA systems with quantum computing will be really quite an amazing and both lethal threat. The next thing I wanted to mention to you is memory. Can we erase memory? Can we modify memory? Can we change memory? Of course the short answer is yes.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo I want you to know the brief thing of this this guy works with is bioweapons with this kind of nanotechnology. And he’s saying what they can is do this kind of substance like the hydrogel, okay? And they can use it for multiple purposes. They’re so good at it with these nanobots. They can rewrite your memory. They can erase your memory, put a new memory inside of you. If you have this substance inside of you that they could do all these things, do you trust them when they say it’s just a drug delivery system. Don’t worry. I don’t trust them. I don’t trust them at all. They can make new memories. They can send an impulse into the body and make you feel something, make a toxin produced, make a neuropeptide produced. There’s no good thing. There’s no God-given reason why anybody would do that to another human.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, you might’ve seen this, patent 2020/060606. Do you think they picked 666 by accident? People have marketing departments, I know, and they know that we have a visceral reaction to 666. We have a contact tracing act, 6666, right? Moderna has ingredients with a number 0.666 or 6.666. This is not accident guys. Symbolism is everywhere. Pay attention. They use symbolism and they will tell you who they serve. And here they’re showing the person as a little tiny speck, that’s you or me, and then there’s a device, which is your cell phone or my cell phone, and then you are wirelessly connected to your cell phone. How does that happen? They have to have a substance inside of you to make you wirelessly connected to everything. It’s called the internet of bodies, the internet of things. And so how do they do that? You have to ask yourself. They want to do it by 2030. They have to make you a walking Wi-Fi electronic device. They can do it with the hydrogel or the nanolipid particle.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, Gates loves this kind of thing because they can hijack your brain when you’re sleeping or just reading the magazine because they can do computing power in the background like a computer and they’re going to make money off of you and you didn’t know it, right? If you accept this technology inside of you. They also want to use it with social credit system of China. I’m kind of speeding through some of these things just because I want to get to the pictures of what I saw inside the microscope.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nBut let’s say you don’t believe what I say. That’s fine. Just know that Bill Gates does. His company in West Africa, along with MasterCard, along with Trust Stamp and artificial intelligence program have combined forces. Since July, 2020, they’ve been experimenting on the people there. Giving them the same shots we have here. Same technology. They are giving them a barcode or a numeric number. Each one is unique. Everything’s downloaded, their medical records, their vaccination records, and their ability to do commodity is also downloaded, downloaded into their body. Doesn’t that sound like something from the book of Revelation? And if they don’t accept it, they’re locked out. It’s a war on cash.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo since they have this technology inside the people, what Bill Gates said, he’s like, “Well, since we already have the hydrogel nanolipid particle inside of you, we’re also going to start using it for surveillance and predictive policing.” Just like I warned you about. They’re doing it to the people right now like the Tom cruise Minority Report. They say once it’s perfected there, all developed countries will get it. That’s you and me too guys. What do they call it? Wellness pass or a vaccine passport. This is why we fight, this is why we say no, this is why we do not comply.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so I talked a lot about this, right? And how did I even get to know about this? Well, if some of you heard my story, you’ll know that at some point of my career, I was recruited. They thought I would be a good person on their side. I was recruited to business owners meetings in Metro Atlanta, as well as scientific meetings where I got to meet Dr. Craig Venter, okay? And so in these meetings, they talked about this whole transhumanist movement and how it was great. We would be the controllers in the room. Don’t worry. We would be exempt. Everybody else would be controlled. I was horrified. I was horrified to see everybody standing ovation and clapping for this. Like who are they? And I asked, “How could you be for this?” They said, “Oh, well, it does sound a little bad, but you know what? Carrie, soon it’s going to be us or them. And so we have to. You’re going to want to be on our side. You don’t want to be on the other side. It’s going to be bad.”\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI said, “I would never do that. And you’re a fool. You’re a fool to think that this technology wouldn’t be turned back on you because we are human beings, right?” And they have a super computer that wants to guide all of this. A computer doesn’t care who you are. It has an algorithm. You have a dollar sign in your head. Sound like the Marines, all for one, one for all. Computers sees it as foolish, frivolous, right? So I had all this knowledge. That’s how I got to know how to research for it, but I was still not happy. I’m a person. I have to know, right? So I decided I’m going to look at inside of these vials, even though it’s not legal, I don’t care because if something goes against my God-given rights and my human rights, it is my duty to break that law.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThis is our world, our planet, our children, our bodies. Don’t give it away. It’s ours, right? So this is one of the pictures of Moderna. I put two drops on a glass slide. I had a compound microscope. That’s it guys. You could get it easily. 300 bucks. And I had a white light going up on the middle and a glass top on the very top. And that’s it. I waited two hours and it was translucent at first then all of a sudden colors appeared. Vibrant purples, blues, reds, greens. I’m like, “I’ve never seen this chemical reaction.” There was no chemical reaction, right? So I ended up finding out all these colors, actually, when they appear under a white light, that’s a sign of a super conducting material inside these injections. All the manufacturers have that. What that means, it’s proof they’re putting an injectable computing system inside every single one of these vials. An injectable computing system. Did they say anything to any of us? No.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThere’s little cubes on this one. Were just showing some of these photos. Here’s another one. It’s hard to see on this photo, but at the very edge, there’s a cube-like structure. We’re not quite sure exactly what that is right now. So also I saw a lot of metallic flex fragments. I didn’t see anything about metal fragments on the ingredient list again. And these metallic fragments to me look a little more exotic. It’s not like your typical aluminum, et cetera, right? This one is strange. It’s so opaque. It leaves its own shadow. Some of these pictures are between 100 times magnification, which is nothing, to 400 up to 600 times magnification. This is not nanotechnology. This is not looking at nanotechnology. This is at a much grander scale. This is crazy.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo this picture kind of has been going around I think. I’m going to give you a close-up of him. This was on the first slide I did and there’s the cover slip, right? So everything gravitated to the very edges of the cover slip. That’s where I saw a lot of action. There was a lot of aggregation. There is self-assembling. This is two hours. It’s not like 12 hours. Two hours time. I also saw this thing. I was shocked. It actually was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. You can’t see it? Okay. It was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. It had tentacles like you see here. It was able to move. It is my opinion and it is my interpretation that it was self-aware. I’ve never encountered anything like that. I’ve done slides, I’ve done all kinds of preparation of slides of biologic materials, et cetera. Never have I witnessed anything like that.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so I did cry. I cried. And then I thought, well, okay, perhaps that was a fluke. Surely maybe some contamination, right? So two months later, I get another Moderna vial and I look at it under the microscope and here’s… What is that? Still trying to figure it out guys, but we shouldn’t have unidentified objects inside of these injections. Another of these string-like material, I’m like looking I’m like, “This almost looks like some kind of a living organism.” And then I see another one. And then I cried hard. You may not know what that means. I do. These are parasites better made to meld with your nervous tissue. Imagine a child that is forming their neural network. I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to get that righteous anger. We need it now. No more.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nJust on a side, if you know the book of Revelation, does it kind of look like a scorpion? Guess what else it can do. The tentacles, it’s called Hydra vulgaris. The tentacles have the ability to give a paralyzing, a venomous or a toxic reaction. Wow, it sounds like something else that I read, right? Why would they want that? Well, Hydra vulgaris is actually a organism, and I don’t know what that is, it’s an organism that is immortal in the lab. It can continually renew itself. If you chop it up into tiny pieces, put in a petri dish, it will actually self-assemble itself back over and over and over again innumerable times. It’ll make itself anew. If you chop off a tentacle, three more will grow. And the transhumanists love this organism. They think it’s fantastic. Again, that was 100 magnification, I’m sorry, the last one. So this is the edge of the cover slip. There’s a lot of debris kind of grapheme-like material. And then we start to see a lot of ring structures in here.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nNow, this one is with the Johnson & Johnson vial. Let me get to the… So, again, ring-like structures. What they are is they appear to be delivery systems. So they’ll start like this and they get bigger, bigger, bigger. They fend themselves out. A gelatinous material extrudes from it like a hydrogel, okay? And then this was like a bundle of cells growing. What are those cells? We don’t know. We need to analyze them. What kind of cells are being injected into people? A crystalline structure, little crystals. Like literally, this is like a kitchen sink, dirty kind of a experiment going on. These are iridescence silicone-like wafers. If they pile on top of each other, they can make their own circuitry boards. Hydrogel it’s a gelatinous material here. Again, more hydrogel with more of these spheres, these rings. So I saw them at all the manufacturers, all of them. So no one is different than another. I don’t care if they come up with a new one, guys. Don’t ask me if it’s safe to take it. They’re all bad.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo I was very fortunate to work with Project Veritas recently. So bravo, right? They’re amazing patriots. Another round of applause. So they will be releasing their findings soon. I worked with them. And so we were looking under the microscope at Pfizer vial and they have documentation to share too from a brave whistleblower. So anyway, this is a Pfizer vial. You see a lot of these dark particles. These are like graphene oxide particle material. So what we were witnessing over time under the microscope was something called Teslaphoresis. Have you heard of that? So what that means is that you can put all these little tiny beads, let’s say, that have the potential to make their own wiring in the body. And what you do is you could just have an external magnetic force or another kind of electric force, let’s say, or frequency, and they will start to form and coalesce into a string-like spider web all by themselves.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo you just have to put the junk in somewhere, turn on a frequency and voila, it starts to make its own neural network, a string-like consistency. We were seeing it here inside of this vial starting to coalesce, starting to form structures. It’s a little bit difficult to see, but up there, if I can do a pointer. Can’t see my pointer. Anyhow, there’s a [inaudible 00:37:55] kind of figure in the middle. So if you knew what a human nerve cell looked like, a dendrite, it would look just like this, but this isn’t from a human guys. This is from whatever they’re injecting inside of you. Literally, this is my opinion, they’re trying to put another kind of nervous system inside of you, but an AI kind, or they’re hijacking this parasite to put inside of you. These are my hypotheses. I encourage you to do your own research. And for the people who don’t believe me, under the microscope, you can get a $300 microscope and you can put the drops on there and you can look and see the pictures too, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo this is another organism. We see this over and over. This would be like a Polypodium or a Hydra vulgaris organism. Again, we see this over, over, over. It’s not a mistake. It’s in different states, multiple vials, multiple batches, multiple times. There’s no mistake. Another one. This is very similar to some ectoderm of a parasite. We could go on and on, parasite after parasite looking… And let me back up. They appear to be parasites, right? If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it probably is, right? Again, more ring-like structures.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nHow is this in the betterment of humanity? Is this why ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are so banned from everybody? Right? Now we know. I want you to see this guy. This guy is another organism that we saw. This was in a Johnson & Johnson vial. Watch closely the translucent thing that moves around the edge of the ring. Do you see that? At first I thought it was another… Let me back up and do that again so you can see. Okay. Oops, I’m going to try to do this properly. Okay. All right. Play. Ah, sorry guys. Anyway, it’s a translucent… I thought it was like a larvae, like another life form, but the way it moved was more robotic to me. This could be a nanobot. We don’t know. I’m showing you pictures. And I think you don’t have to have a science degree. You don’t have to have a medical degree to know that should not be in any human body injected into to our children, our babies, and us.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI want to show you this. We had a healthy blood of a young man, put a drop under the slide. It moved normally, right? Every time we added a drop of the injection from the Pfizer vial, this organism formed, which looked just like the coronavirus. You know what? It wasn’t in the vial by itself. It wasn’t in the blood. Only when the blood and the injection, or I’m sorry, the contents of the vial hit together, that formed. I want to hypothesize that this structure they’re calling the coronavirus is inside these vials. It’s a hypothesis that’s saying, we need to look into it.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI want you to see how much… This is one drop of Moderna. One drop. One drop. Look at the movement. It’s not normal. They tell you they’re putting living organisms inside of you. This is just more graphing kind of a substance. Hydra vulgaris, look it up. UC Davis loves this against the transhumanist movement because of all of this. And it’s kind of funny they like to say hail Hydra. Have you heard of that before? Symbolism is everywhere. Watch for it then you’ll know who they serve. Just more about the hail Hydra and its life forms, but I like to always see symbolism, right? So the grown version of this Hydra is called a medusa and the Hydra also means many headed serpent. Wow, I read that before on the book of Revelation. This is just showing how they can chop it up and put it into a vial and then it can grow itself again once it’s in its host.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI’m sorry. I can’t hear you. I’ll go back. Sorry about that. Okay, got it. Is that good? Okay, got it. Okay, this slide was just to show you that maybe one may not be Hydro vulgaris. Maybe it’s Nematostella or Acropora. Okay, my point is it comes from the same family. They all can do the same things, okay? We can go into splicing hairs later, but this is just to show you that they all can do this. And so my warning to you is this is a picture. It says a thousand words, right? And I want to shock you. I want to make you have emotion and passion because that’s what we need right now.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd people ask me, “Well, how did this happen and how do we get out of it?” Why we got here it’s one reason. We disconnected ourselves from God, our Father in heaven. God did not leave us. We love God. We need to make that right. These are praying and worshiping and putting God first in everything and remembering who you are and what you are. You are royal birthright. You have a divinity inside of you, a light that God gave every single one of us if you choose to connect with it because we have free will, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nIf you haven’t read on Jesus Christ, you should because he gave us the instructions on what to do right now. With God we are unstoppable. We are powerful beings. We don’t have to be afraid of any of this technology because with God, we have this force that in a blink of an eye, we change it all. And you just don’t know who you are yet. And I’m here with you because I’m here to remind you who you are. And for my last breath on this earth, I will fight with you and for you and for the world and for our children. There’s nothing greater in this world. Thank you. [inaudible 00:45:01].\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nDr. Carrie Madej. Wow, that was amazing. That was amazing. I was watching that for quite a while from the back and blown away with a lot of that stuff. A lot of the stuff I was not even aware of though. Thank you Dr. Madej.\n\nEnd Transcript\n\nDr. Carrie Madej is originally from Dearborn, Michigan and received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences in 2001.

        "Even as Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. “have stabilized,” a document produced that same day by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and circulated to the other government agencies warns that infections in the U.S. have increased more than 18 percent.\n\n“Cases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000 — down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May,” Pence wrote Tuesday in his op-ed, which defended President Trump’s response to the pandemic.\n\nYet the CDC’s June 16 COVID-19 Response Update appears to paint a darker portrait of the state of the pandemic, with maps showing many counties in the U.S. experiencing increasing rates of the coronavirus. Of the figures highlighted, a chart shows that the U.S. rate of increase for the coronavirus using a three-day average is 18.3 percent. By comparison, two of the hardest-hit countries have declining rates based on this same three-day average: Brazil’s cases came down 27 percent, and Russia’s have decreased by almost 7 percent.\n\nNeither the CDC nor Pence’s office responded to a request for comment. Pence remains the head of the White House coronavirus task force, which has all but faded from view in recent weeks. The task force’s last public briefing was in late April, though its members still meet regularly.\n\nIn a press briefing Friday, June 12, CDC Director Robert Redfield indicated that some of the increasing case numbers result from more widespread testing at facilities that have had large outbreaks, such as nursing homes, prisons and meat-processing facilities, but even that is “not explaining everything.”\n\nThe CDC update is marked as an “internal” government document, meaning it is not intended to be released to the public. Yahoo News obtained a copy of the report, which was distributed within the government the same day Pence’s op-ed was published.\n\nThe explanatory text accompanying the CDC maps also appears to contradict Pence’s optimistic message about the coronavirus. “There remains a large number of counties whose burden continues to grow or are in an elevated incidence plateau, including in Wyoming, Iowa, Washington, California and in parts of the Southwest and Southeast,” the CDC document reads in a caption accompanying a map showing large swaths of the country as either in “elevated incidence” or “rebound” for coronavirus cases.\n\nA separate map showing the number of new cases notes that “elevated incidence of disease during the past 2 weeks remains widespread, including in the Northeast (and the New York City area), the Southwest, the Southeast, DC, areas around Chicago, and parts of California, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington.”\n\nPence’s op-ed also appeared on the same day the Wall Street Journal ran an article based on an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, who sounded a far more pessimistic view about the country’s progress than the vice president.\n\n“People keep talking about a second wave,” Fauci told the newspaper. “We’re still in a first wave.”\n\nFauci also disputed the idea that testing alone accounts for the recent rise in U.S. cases, a claim regularly made by President Trump.\n\nDespite the divergence regarding whether COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have “stabilized,” Pence and the CDC appear to be in sync when it comes to figures showing significantly declining death rates. Pence wrote that “in the past five days, deaths are down to fewer than 750 a day, a dramatic decline from 2,500 a day a few weeks ago — and a far cry from the 5,000 a day that some were predicting.”\n\nAccording to the CDC documents, death rates have declined by about 22 percent, based on the prior three-day average. New deaths are down to 646, even lower than Pence noted, though the average number of new deaths, the CDC document says, is at 829."

        "Numbers have a certain mystique: They seem precise, exact, sometimes even beyond doubt. But outside the field of pure mathematics, this reputation rarely is deserved. And when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic, buying into that can be downright dangerous.\n\nNaturally, everyone wants to know how deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is.\n\nWe know, irrefutably, one thing about the coronavirus in the United States: The number of cases reported in every chart and table is far too low.\n\nThe other problem is, now that the U.S. appears to be ramping up testing, the number of cases will grow quickly. Public-health officials are currently cautioning people not to worry as that happens, but it will be hard to disambiguate what proportion of the ballooning number of cases is the result of more testing and what proportion is from the actual spread of the virus.\n\nPeople trust data. Numbers seem real. Charts have charismatic power. People believe what can be quantified. But data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world.\n\nThe reality gap between American numbers and American cases is wide. Regular citizens and decision makers cannot rely on only the numbers to make decisions. Sometimes quantification actually obscures as much as it reveals.\n\nJust a day ago, an example of how WHO manipulate the numbers regarding U.S!\n\nBelow you have two screenshots from WHO official website, the first part is from: March 22, 2020, 17:44 GMT; the second one: March 22, 2020, 21:30 GMT. Decide yourself!\n\nThe first part:\n\nThe second part:\n\nPlease do not forget: Protect yourself and your family!\n\nTake care of your health and protect others by doing the following:\n\nWash your hands frequently\n\nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\nMaintain social distancing\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\n\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\nPractice respiratory hygiene\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n\nWhy? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\nIf you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority."

        "Some Beijing residents have lashed out at local COVID measures after they were required to wear electronic monitoring wristbands. The wristband, worn 24 hours a day for seven days straight, was issued to returning domestic travelers in the northern Beijing residential district of Tiantongyuan. The wristband, connected to a phone, checks body temperature every five minutes and has access to phone location, camera, and microphone. Some of the wristbands were reportedly withdrawn after backlash surfaced on Chinese microblogging site Weibo. A Beijing COVID-19 hotline separately told both China Daily and the South China Morning Post that use of the wristbands was at a residential community’s discretion.

Minneapolis police snipers fatally shot Sundberg from a roof of an apartment building across the street following a six-hour standoff. Black Lives Matter protesters converged at Sunberg’s home, but faced backlash from Arabella Yarbrough, the neighbor whom Sunberg had reportedly been trying to shoot when police were called. A video featuring Arabella Yarbrough has gone viral; she can be seen imploring the protesters, who included Sunberg’s adoptive parents, to go home. The Sundbergs have retained and attorney. She said, “This is not a George Floyd situation. George Floyd was unarmed. My kids have to deal with this and probably have a mental illness now because they almost lost their lives.” She continued, “There’s bullet holes in the kitchen because he sat in the f*cking hallway watching my move.

        "David Martin is one of the key people seeking justice in lawsuits suing medical companies and the federal government involved in delivering the so-called vaccines for COVID-19. In this interview, he provides evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned and that the vaccines are bioweapons. He estimated that the COVID-19 injections will kill 700 million people worldwide and 75 million to 100 million Americans. David Martin is one of the speakers at G. Edward Griffin’s Red Pill Expo to be held in Indianapolis, Indiana on July 9 and 10.

He quoted Peter Daszak, who sent money to the Wuhan lab in China, and told the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 that “To sustain the funding beyond the crisis we need to increase the public understanding for the need for medical countermeasures, such as a pan Coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media and the economics will follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.”\n\nMartin has filed a lawsuit against those he has accused of fraud and says that they knew they were changing DNA and chromosomes and what it means to be human. He named Dr. Anthony Fauci of the CDC for funding Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who pursued gain-of-function research.\n\nMartin reported that by 2005, Baric went to the DARPA bioweapons conference and heralded that the corona virus was an ideal bioweapon candidate. In addition, Ralph Baric is on the patent for Remdesivir, a controversial COVID-19 drug that Martin says is killing people.\n\nMartin reported that in September of 2019, Fauci referenced the “accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen” so that by September 2020, “the world would embrace a universal vaccine platform” and that he was going to own the disposition of that platform. Fauci knew he was planning the death and destruction of Americans.\n\nMartin said that the COVID-19 vaccines do not fit the statutory definition of a vaccine, which is the disruption of infection or transmission. Martin explained why the shots are bioweapons and said that COVID vaccines were designed to limit the severity of disease and hospitalization and have failed to disrupt the infection or transmission. He said that it is a criminal act, it is domestic terror and racketeering for personal profit, which is organized crime.\n\nUSA Watchdog: https://usawatchdog.com/up-to-700-million-worldwide-will-die-from-cv19-vax-by-2028-dr-david-martin/\n\nTranscript: https://seemorerocks.is/dr-david-martin-700-million-worldwide-will-die-from-cv19-vax-by-2028/\n\nDailyMail: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10676901/How-Fauci-NIH-gave-millions-fund-Peter-Daszaks-gain-function-research.html"

        "Dr. Byram W. Bridle,\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) had requested 75 years to release the documents that they reviewed from Pfizer prior to issuing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b mRNA ‘vaccine’ (Comirnaty) against SARS-CoV-2, which can cause COVID-19. However, a judge over-ruled this and issued a court order that the documents be released in large monthly installments. Today, a set of data from this data release were brought to my attention. They are not new. They are from a document that was in the data dump released back in May of this year. However, I want to help my fellow scientists in making sure that this science gets widely distributed throughout the world. This is for the sake of ‘fully informed consent’, something that regulatory agencies, public health officials and too many physicians seem to have abandoned over the past couple of years.\n\nFor a long time I have been arguing that our children need to be left out of the massive conflicts over the science underpinning COVID-19. In my opinion, adults can conduct their own risk-benefit analyses regarding whether they want to receive one of the current COVID-19 inoculations. However, far too many adults are making these decisions based on pseudo-science, data from flawed studies, misinformation, and outright disinformation being propagated by physicians and public health officials, many of whom are unqualified to opine on anything in the field of vaccinology. I have never felt comfortable about these injections being used in ‘children, adolescents and young-adults of child-bearing age’. This was the precise terminology I used in a parent’s guide to COVID-19 vaccines that I wrote more than one year ago.\n\nThe highest quality data for assessing a novel medical product are derived from clinical studies. This is because these types of experiments in people are typically well-controlled and include what is known as ‘active monitoring’; there is follow-up to assess safety and efficacy. This is why the clinical testing phases should never be compromised. With this in mind, let’s explore a set of data that Pfizer provided to the US-FDA that was based on passive monitoring, which underestimates problems to an unknown degree. Here is the relevant document…\n\nReissue 5 958KB ∙ PDF File Read now\n\nThe data in this document were accumulated up until February 28, 2021. Notably, on page 9, safety concerns based on the US Pharmacovigilance Plan included “missing information” on “Use in Pregnancy and lactation”. Here are the data that were available at that time regarding outcomes in pregnant women that had received Pfizer’s COVID-19 inoculation; this is quoted from the top of table 6 (I have italicized and/or bolded the most important points)…\n\nPregnancy cases: 274 cases including: • 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3 mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins). • Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted).\n\nApparently, outcomes will never be known for 88% (238/270) of the adverse event reports that involved pregnancies. Why was the follow-up rate on these cases so abysmal?\n\nNutriTruth has a graph on their website that summarizes the results from adverse event reports for which follow-up data were available…\n\nIt appears that data would be available for five of the pregnancies, but these outcomes were still unknown at the time that Pfizer’s document was written. As such, there are solid data available from 29 pregnancies. One out of 29 of these pregnancies resulted in a ‘normal’ outcome. This means that 28 out of the 29 babies died. That is a 97% death rate should an adverse event occur during pregnancy. Even in the case of the ‘normal outcome’, this means there was an ‘apparently’ healthy baby. However, one cannot be certain that the outcome was ‘normal’, until the baby has had all of their physiological systems fully mature, which means early adulthood.\n\nI have looked at Pfizer’s pre-clinical reproductive toxicity data and they are fatally flawed. Issues included ‘vaccinating’ the females only; apparently it was forgotten that ‘it takes two to tango’. Also, the rodent models that were used express the low-affinity version of the receptor for the spike protein encoded by the ‘vaccines’. People express the high-affinity receptor. This means the rodent models aren’t capable of revealing toxicities that might be associated with the spike protein. In short, the pre-clinical studies could provide no assurance whatsoever that Pfizer’s vaccine would be safe in the context of pregnancy.\n\nI have collaborated with scientists and physicians about the post-rollout ‘real-world’ studies on pregnancy and the COVID-19 shots. They are highly flawed. I co-authored a paper about this, but have yet to find an editor that will even allow it to undergo peer review (I have had no problems with this for any of my cancer- or basic virology-focused papers). Regardless, many other reputable scientists and physicians have been addressing this.\n\nMany countries have pushed Pfizer’s COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ on pregnant women, often via mandates. This was been done with the full blessing of their societies for obstetrics and gynecology. Are obstetricians and gynecologists going to continue to make these recommendations when adverse events in pregnant women almost always end in a fatality for the baby? At the end of the day, couples experiencing pregnancies or who wish to do so must make it their own responsibility to educate themselves to facilitate fully informed consent. Too many obstetricians and gynecologists are either too superficially trained in the immunological sub-discipline of vaccinology or are too afraid of contradicting a narrative for which dissent is punished. Some physicians are starting to speak up about this. Unfortunately, their singular personal observations are simply deemed anecdotal. However, as a scientist, I have been trained to observe the cumulative nature of these reports; to not dismiss them out-of-hand, and to use them to formulate legitimate scientific questions.\n\nIf you or your baby have experienced any issues post-inoculation, please report these to your physician. They are obligated to submit an adverse event report, without opining on whether or not they think it might or might not be related. The accumulation of these reports is the only way scientists can help identify safety signals during a public rollout of a novel medical product.\n\nA 97% death rate among babies from pregnant mothers who reported an adverse event after they were ‘vaccinated’ is appalling. And this was from Pfizer’s own reported adverse events as part of their post-marketing pharmacovigilance plan (which means people volunteering safety data after the public rollout of Pfizer’s inoculation).\n\nIf I were a regulatory scientist assessing the pregnancy outcome data from Pfizer, there is no way that I would ever have supported the use of their inoculation in pregnant women. Data from adverse event reporting is a red flag. This indicates the need for large-scale and long-term active safety monitoring, not passive systems like the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States or the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System, which underestimate the number of side-effects.. And I would never have allowed ‘real-world’ data from flawed reproductive studies to replace proper pre-clinical and clinical trials. Nor would I remain silent about this knowledge.

        "By Paul Sacca,\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency.\n\n“I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Saturday morning during a briefing in Geneva.\n\nMembers of an expert committee met on Thursday to decide if the current monkeypox outbreak should be escalated to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Of the virologists, vaccinologists, epidemiologists, and health experts, nine voted against declaring monkeypox a PHEIC, and six voted in favor, according to Reuters.\n\nThe International Health Regulations Emergency Committee were “resolved by consensus to advise the WHO Director-General that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute a PHEIC.”\n\n“However, the Committee unanimously acknowledged the emergency nature of the event and that controlling the further spread of outbreak requires intense response efforts,” according to the WHO. “The Committee advised that the event should be closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks, once more information about the current unknowns becomes available, to determine if significant changes have occurred that may warrant a reconsideration of their advice.”\n\nIn the end, Ghebreyesus overrode the committee and declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency of international concern – which is the WHO’s highest level of alert.\n\nAccording to The Nation’s Health website, “A PHEIC gives WHO authority to make formal recommendations to contain an outbreak. The declaration is intended to raise public awareness and can galvanize funding, expertise, and resources from other member nations, said Lawrence Gostin, JD, an international health law professor at Georgetown University.”\n\nABC News noted that this is the seventh event declared a PHEIC by the WHO since 2007, “The other six include the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009; the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2015; the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2018 to 2020; the Zika outbreak in 2016; the ongoing spread of poliovirus that started in 2014; and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to the National Library of Medicine.”\n\nNOW – WHO's Tedros: \"I have decided that the global #monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\" pic.twitter.com/QPjiFSsBog — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) July 23, 2022\n\nTedros stated, “Although I’m declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment, this is an outbreak that’s concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners. That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.”\n\nThe World Health Organization director-general added, “Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been more than 16,000 global cases of monkeypox in 2022 in 74 countries.\n\nThere have been nearly 3,000 cases in the United States this year, according to the CDC. As of Wednesday, there were 679 cases of monkeypox in New York – 94% of them in New York City, according to state officials.\n\nThere have reportedly been a total of five deaths from monkeypox worldwide.\n\nThe Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported, “Though the outbreak is heavily concentrated in Europe, the five deaths have been reported in African nations.”\n\nThe Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA) – which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – has purchased a total of 6.9 million monkeypox vaccines through mid-2023.\n\nThe WHO noted that monkeypox is a “viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although it is clinically less severe.”\n\n“Monkeypox primarily occurs in central and west Africa, often in proximity to tropical rainforests, and has been increasingly appearing in urban areas,” the global health agency stated. “Animal hosts include a range of rodents and non-human primates.”\n\nSource: https://www.theblaze.com\n\nYour Tax Free Donations Are Appreciated and Help Fund our Volunteer Website and Orphanage"

        "WHO is planning to keep the pandemic going for 10 years, pushing new diseases if necessary\n\nThe globalists in the World Health Organization (WHO) are preparing to unleash the next infectious disease to keep the world under control until at least 2030.\n\nThis is according to Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who works with the WHO. She admitted during an interview that the organization has a 10-year plan, supposedly to deal with the current Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and an expected second pandemic. (Related: WHO attempts to take control of future plandemics in a “totalitarian power grab” move.)\n\n“This has been in the WHO’s 10-year plan for some time,” said Koopmans. “That plan says that there will be a major infectious disease crisis.”\n\n“Why does the WHO have a 10-year plan announcing 10 years of pandemics? How can they know?” asked David Sorensen in a video detailing evidence that the WHO is planning to keep the pandemic going until 2030.\n\nFor context, Koopmans is a former member of the WHO’s first team to go to China to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was removed from the group following reports revealing her extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIndependent news site the National Pulse exposed Koopmans’ role on a scientific advisory board for the Centers for Disease Control of Guangdong, China.\n\n“She has advised on the building of the laboratory capacity for emerging infectious disease detection in this region, and has ongoing research collaborations trying to unravel emergence and spread of viruses through the animal production chain in this region,” read a summary of her work with the Chinese-run body.\n\nBill Gates heavily involved in planning the next pandemic\n\nBill Gates, who has accumulated an additional $50 billion in wealth simply by distributing vaccines, is part of the effort preparing the world to accept that the next pandemic is on its way.\n\nDuring an interview with liberal comedian Stephen Colbert, Gates admitted that there will be a “pandemic two” once the world is no longer willing to go along with the restrictions put in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, which he calls “pandemic one.”\n\n“Most of the work we’re going to do to be ready for pandemic two – I call this pandemic one – most of the work we’ll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism,” said Gates.\n\nIn a separate interview, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda even admitted that the next pandemic will keep people’s attention focused on the spreading disease.\n\n“We’ll have to prepare for the next one. That will get attention this time,” he said. Both he and Melinda were grinning and chuckling the whole time they were announcing the coming of the second pandemic.\n\nGates has been preparing for the pandemic as early as 2018, when he said a global pandemic is on its way and that it could wipe out as many as 30 million people.\n\n“Bill Gates is essentially the owner of the WHO,” commented Sorensen. He added that thousands of physicians and scientists worldwide agree that the WHO- and Gates-engineered pandemic was planned with the purpose of increasing the globalists’ control over the world and reducing the world population.\n\nLearn more about the plans of the globalists at Globalism.news.\n\nWatch this video from David Sorensen as he discusses the WHO’s 10-year plan for ongoing infectious diseases from 2020 to 2030.\n\nThis video can be found in the channel The Prisoner on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nInternational group funded by Bill Gates warns that one of 11 new viruses will become “next pandemic.”\n\nBiden wants more money to prepare for the “second pandemic” he promises is coming.\n\nDr. Jim Meehan: Monkeypox outbreak was ENGINEERED because people are no longer afraid of C OVID-19.\n\nNonprofit funded by CNN co-founder was PREPARING for the monkeypox outbreak in 2021.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nTheNewAmerican.com\n\nStopWorldControl.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Young Colorado man reluctantly took covid jab to travel and had to undergo emergency surgery, after multiple blood clots formed in his leg\n\nA young 39-year-old man suddenly developed multiple blood clots in his leg after taking the Johnson & Johnson viral vector covid-19 vaccine. The young man, named Matthew Erickson, was traveling with his father when he noticed unusual pains forming in his leg. Doctors told him not to worry. Erickson sought emergency medical care in Turkey anyway, and was able to undergo surgery before the abnormal, out-of-the-ordinary blood clots traveled to his heart or brain. The Turkish doctors pulled multiple 4-inch blood clots from Erickson’s legs. The doctors saved his leg from amputation and ultimately saved his life.\n\nMr. Erickson is now making a case that he was injured by the experimental Johnson & Johnson shot. He knows what happened to his body. Now that his life has been miraculously saved, he may find new purpose in standing up for others who were coerced to get the potentially lethal shot(s).\n\nOn June 8, Erickson wrote:\n\nToday marks a month ago they pulled out these blood clots out of my leg. After extensive testing my heart and other ways this could of happened; it’s pointing directly at the J&J COVID Vaccine. If you or anyone you know have took the vaccine and had side effects small or big; please report them to VAERS and let me know too! I’m praising God I didn’t loose my leg, had a stroke, had kidney failure or died!!! Thank you to those who prayed for me and your continued prayers since I still have more Doctors visits.\n\nYoung man educated himself about vaccine-induced blood clots, and was able to get help before the vaccine took his life\n\nMr. Erickson was fully aware of the side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. According to his social media posts, he questioned the vaccine when it came out, and he tried to avoid it as long as possible.\n\nIn April of 2021, he openly questioned why the vaccinated were still wearing masks in public places. If the vaccine worked, why did the vaccinated need to mask up with another layer of illusionary protection.\n\nDuring the past NFL football season, Mr. Erickson also praised Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers for standing his ground, rejecting the vaccine, and promoting efficacious treatments and natural immunity for covid-19.\n\nIn September of 2021, Erickson railed against Pfizer for developing a vaccine that causes blood clots, while simultaneously selling drugs that treat those blood clots.\n\nWhen Erickson and his father wanted to travel to the Bahamas on a cruise ship, he must have changed his mind about getting the vaccine. According to his social media posts, the two men were able to avoid discriminatory measures put forth by the cruise line. These discriminatory measures were put in place to punish the unvaccinated, coercing them to abide by the CDC’s rules. In his posts, Erickson talked about getting first class treatment on the cruise, while the unvaccinated were bullied into wearing masks. The father and son ultimately planned a trip across Europe in 2022, where similar vaccine mandates demanded they submit their body autonomy and their genetics over to Big Pharma.\n\nWhile Erickson ultimately caved to the pressure, he had previously educated himself about vaccine’s side effects. Due to his awareness, Mr. Erickson was able to seek medical care before the vaccine-induced blood clots took his life. This is an important point because people around the world are being told that side effects are mild, that life-threatening adverse events are rare. People are not given adequate informed consent nor are they being properly screened for prior immunity or warned about their proclivity for vaccine injury and sudden death.\n\nMorticians sound the alarm on fully-vaccinated corpses presenting “suspicious clots” during embalming\n\nA brave Alabama mortician named Richard Hirschman went public in a February 2022 interview about the large blood clots that were coming out of the fully-vaccinated deceased after they are embalmed. He reports that a new type of “white fibrous material” is coming out of the arteries of the dead bodies. This material does not present as a normal blood clot.\n\nIn January of 2022, Hirschman found these “suspicious clots” in 37 of the 57 embalming jobs he conducted. He said he knew of fifteen other morticians who were finding the same strange clots, but were afraid to report on it. His reports are corroborated by other morticians, including Mr. Cary Watkins of Alabama, Ms. Anna Foster of Missouri, and other anonymous morticians who have since come to the independent media to speak out.\n\nOver the same time period, a British mortician named John O’Looney reported a “500-600% increase” in death for people below age thirty, and he said that nearly all the deaths are caused by these strange new blood clots. These blood clots are predominantly occurring in fully-vaccinated individuals who were told that their lives could go back to normal if they just complied.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheCovidBlog.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Nearly all of the government’s COVID information websites are secret SPYING operations\n\nEuropean researchers put together a study revealing that government-run Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) information websites are a privacy-invading nightmare – let the public beware!\n\nEntitled “Measuring Web Cookies in Governmental Websites,” the paper, which was funded by the European Research Council (ERC), the European Union (EU), and the Spanish government, explains that government websites are basically being used as “a single point of monitoring and tracking for the entire population of a country” using web cookies.\n\nResearchers looked at three different types of websites, including the official governmental websites of “G20” countries around the world; websites of international organizations such as the United Nations; and popular websites used by the public for Fauci Flu tracking and information. They looked at each site’s use of cookies and came to the conclusion that upwards of 90 percent of government websites “create cookies of third-party trackers without any consent from users.”\n\n“Web cookies have been exploited to collect information about users’ online activities and interests,” the paper explains (Related: The Transportation Security Administration [TSA] also spies on air travelers).\n\n“Non-session cookies, that are created by trackers and can last for days or months, are widely present even in countries with strict user privacy laws. We also show that the above is a problem for official websites of international organizations and popular websites that inform the public about the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nHere’s a tip: don’t visit any government COVID websites in the first place and you won’t be tracked\n\nThe world’s largest economies, in other words, are engaging in undisclosed and potentially illegal spying and surveillance schemes via official government websites that the public uses to learn about COVID and engage in other forms of propaganda consumption.\n\nOf the 5,550 governmental websites and more than 118,000 URLs administrated by governments, more than 50 percent of their cookies belong to third parties, while anywhere from 10-90 percent originates from known trackers.\n\n“Most of these cookies have a life span of more than a day and many an expiration time of a year or more,” the study reveals.\n\nRoughly 60 percent of government websites use at least one third-party cookie while 95 percent, or nearly all, of them, are creating cookies without user consent. Third-party cookies, by the way, are “known to be tracking users for data collection purposes,” the study explains.\n\nGovernment websites about the Chinese Virus are the worst offenders, as 99 percent contain hidden cookies that were placed there without user consent.\n\n“For example, the very popular website with global maps about the COVID-19 cases, maintained by Johns Hopkins University, add cookies from 7 trackers,” the paper further reads.\n\n“All the other Top 10 websites are official national information websites in European countries that have three trackers or more. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also in the Top 10, with cookies associated with three trackers.”\n\nIt used to be that this type of thing only occurred in overtly communist countries such as China, which leads the way in totalitarianism. As of late, however, the United States and other Western powers appear to be emulating the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) model by imposing “social credit score”-type systems in their respective countries.\n\nThe Fauci Flu quickly became a catchall excuse to invade people’s privacy, force certain restrictive behaviors, and even commit medical rape in the form of mandatory masking and “vaccination.”\n\nIt turns out that even on the web the government is violating people’s rights and tracking their behavior without permission. The full scope of why the government wants to track people’s online behavior has yet to come into view.\n\nMore related news can be found at BigGovernment.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheNationalPulse.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Wife of former Connecticut state representative admits to stealing COVID-19 funds\n\nThe wife of a former Connecticut state lawmaker pleaded guilty for stealing more than $600,000 in federal relief funds for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) from the city of West Haven.\n\nLauren DiMassa, wife of former Connecticut Rep. Michael DiMassa, is one of several people arrested during the investigation. She pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in the U.S. District County in Hartford. However, sentencing has not yet been scheduled and she remains free on bail.\n\nFederal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa nearly $148,000 for services that she never provided to the city. She and her husband were also accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services, such as youth violence prevention.\n\nHer lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that she turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council.\n\nMichael DiMassa has held several positions in the city, including administrative assistant to the West Haven City Council, clerk of the West Haven City Council, assistant to the West Haven mayor and assistant to the West Haven registrar of voters.\n\nIn late 2020, West Haven’s Democratic Mayor Nancy Rossi designated him as one of the two city officials who have been given authority to approve spending on COVID-19 issues. (Related: Rural California counties claim Dem governor withholding pandemic funds.)\n\nHe resigned from his position as a state representative and aide to the city council following his arrest in October, but he pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nProsecutors, however, alleged that Michael DiMassa used his position as a lawmaker to steal the money and finance his gambling activities at the Mohegan Sun Casino.\n\nHis former business partner, John Bernardo, who served as a housing specialist for the city, pleaded guilty to a federal wire fraud charge last month for his role in the theft. A fourth person charged in the case, John Trassaco, pleaded not guilty. Trasacco is a business owner linked to the fraudulent invoices submitted to the city for COVID-19 services that were never provided.\n\nFraud case opened in February\n\nThe case first came to light in February, with DiMassa, his wife, Bernardo and Tracasso charged with stealing the $600,000 by submitting fraudulent invoices to the city through a company they formed in January 2021 called Compass Investment Group, LLC.\n\nThe city of West Haven received over $1.1 million in federal pandemic relief funds between July 2020 and September 2021. The indictment alleged that DiMassa, who was authorized to approve the reimbursement of COVID-related expenditures, conspired with the others to steal the said funds.\n\nThe indictment further alleged that DiMassa and Trasacco conspired to submit fraudulent invoices through two entities controlled by the latter – L&H Company and JIL Sanitation Services – for “goods and services.” These included thousands of units of PPE, HVAC maintenance at multiple municipal locations, COVID-related supplies for the city’s Board of Education and cleaning services for municipal and school buildings, including one that had been vacant for years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, both companies received approximately $421,982.\n\nDiMassa and his wife have also been accused of submitting numerous fraudulent invoices for services related to youth violence programs, including counseling services, meals, support group supplies and wi-fi assistance for lower-to-moderate income families.\n\nThe indictment further stated that the city of West Haven made at least 16 payments totaling $147,776 to DiMassa’s wife, who never provided services to the city.\n\nVisit Corruption.news for more updates about cases involving corrupt politicians in America.\n\nWest Haven is not the only city that funneled its federal coronavirus budget.

        "Governments that mandated deadly covid vaccines now blaming DOCTORS for not telling patients about the risks\n\nAfter becoming the first country in the world to mandate Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” on all citizens, Austria is now trying to shift responsibility onto doctors for all the health damage that resulted.\n\nAustrian Green Minister of Health Johannes Rauch says physicians, and not himself and his fellow politicians, are to blame for all the injuries and deaths because they failed to warn their patients about the risks involved with getting injected.\n\nNever mind the fact that these patients had no choice but to get them – and doctors were basically required to give them. In Rauch’s mind, it is someone else’s fault that thousands of Austrians are now dead or permanently injured because of the policies he helped create.\n\nThe SuperSpreader Substack is calling Rauch’s blame game the “most epic throwing under the bus to save your own a** of our generation” – and he is right. Not only is Rauch’s claim nonsensical, but it absolutely shows that the plandemic is crumbling to pieces at a rapid pace.\n\n“Anyone paying attention already understands that once the bodies start piling up the REAL fireworks will begin,” the “Mole” Substack adds.\n\n“We will see frantic finger pointing and rabid blame shifting. Screeching turned up to 11 competing with a word vomit of lies about who said what and when. It will be something spectacular to behold.”\n\nIf Austrian doctors had reported jab injuries, they would have lost their licenses\n\nIt turns out that there was never even a way for Austrian doctors to warn their patients about the risks involved, seeing as how those risks were concealed by politicians and their Big Pharma buddies who wanted the truth to be kept under wraps.\n\nNot only that, but doctors in Austria are not even allowed to report vaccine damage, even in suspected cases. This is due to “strict instructions from the medical association,” one person in the know tweeted.\n\n“Anyone who violates this is revoked the right to ordain,” the tweet further explains.\n\nNone of this was revealed by the corporate-controlled media, however. Headlines all around the world cited Rauch’s claim that the “medical profession” is to blame for covid jab injuries and deaths.\n\nOne headline declared that Rauch dropped a “liability hammer” by supposedly “confirming” that “doctors are responsible for vaccine damage” simply because they were the ones who were told to stick the injections into people’s arms, or else.\n\n“He seems to be trying to pull his own head out of the ever-tightening noose and to want to shirk responsibility,” one critical report said about Rauch’s shifting of blame.\n\n“Although he prescribes the ‘vaccinations,’ liability is shifted entirely to the medical profession.”\n\nDoctors face fines of up to 14,000 euros for covid “vaccine” injuries and deaths\n\nLaying blame on doctors is apparently not enough for Rauch. He also supports penalizing doctors up to 14,000 euros for their role in administering the jabs that caused many to become injured or die.\n\nEven though Austrian doctors basically had no choice in the matter, except to refuse and lose their medical licenses, Rauch stated that he is not responsible at all and that doctors need to pay a price.\n\n“The scope of medical education has been shown in the Austrian vaccination plan for years and I can assume that doctors work in accordance with the recommendations and the state of the art,” Rauch is quoted as saying, claiming innocence in the matter.\n\nIn essence, Rauch is saying that doctors should have avoided listening to him and instead done their own due diligence into the shots to see if they really were “safe and effective” like Rauch and others claimed.\n\n“The function of the information is to protect the freedom of decision of the person concerned,” one report explains. “This can be punished under administrative and / or disciplinary law as well as have consequences under liability law.”\n\nIf Rauch’s perspective becomes the Austrian government’s official position, then doctors all across that country could face lawsuits in the coming months and years over the role they apparently played in deceiving the masses into rolling up their sleeves for deadly “medicine.”\n\n“That is rich after their government even mulled a vax mandate for all adults and tried to silence all critics,” wrote a reader at the “Mole” Substack.\n\n“He’s right about the fact that medical doctors who failed to inform patients of the risks betrayed their medical responsibility,” suggested another. “However, a governing board that threatened the licenses of doctors who were true to their medical responsibilities are also to blame.”\n\nAnother also blamed the media for “just following orders” and reporting whatever the government and Big Pharma told them to.\n\n“This is all about good versus evil,” this person added. “And all will be judged.”\n\nThe latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” program can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nMole.substack.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "DEATH SHOTS: Canadian data show that COVID “vaccines” INCREASE the risk of death from covid\n\nNot only does Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) not protect against COVID, but official government data from the Canadian province of Manitoba show that the shots actually increase a person’s risk of death.\n\nThe latest figures available for May show that only nine percent of deaths and 14 percent of hospital admissions in the province were unvaccinated people, despite them representing 17 percent of the population.\n\nAn analysis of the data further shows that vaccinated, but unboosted people are about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die from covid compared to unvaccinated people (Related: Last summer, the Canadian government forced people to get injected in order to travel).\n\n“People who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated,” notes Alex Berenson about the data.\n\nTwo illustrative charts, which you can view on Berenson’s Substack, show that hospitalizations and deaths are most prominent among the fully jabbed, all things considered.\n\n“These figures and estimates differ markedly from those the Centers for Disease Control have provided for American COVID deaths,” Berenson further writes. “But they are likely to be far more accurate.”\n\n“American hospitals and health authorities classify COVID deaths and hospitalizations as occurring in the unvaccinated until proven otherwise.”\n\nHow many lives have been lost BECAUSE of covid vaccines?\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the American data collection model is that it relies on self-reporting within a system of privatized insurance. In Canada and elsewhere with nationalized health insurance, jab registries can more easily be matched against hospital admissions and deaths.\n\nIn every country where nationalized health care exists, it is obvious from the data that far more “fully vaccinated” people than unvaccinated people are getting sick and dying from what they are calling covid.\n\n“Still, the data from Manitoba appear to mark the first time that any government agency has actually found a higher risk of death in vaccinated people,” Berenson notes.\n\nThe Manitoba data fully implicate Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for crimes against humanity, seeing as how he was the ringleader in that country for mass injection.\n\n“When will Canadian citizens demand that Trudeau is arrested, tried and executed for blatant violations of the Nuremburg Code?” asked one of Berenson’s subscribers. “When will we all stop soft-pedaling genocide by globalist parasites?\n\nKeep in mind that Trudeau, like most politicians, is just a figurehead puppet who likely takes orders from some invisible entity far up above him. And they deserve the same prosecutorial treatment as he does.\n\n“They just approved the shots for children,” added another commenter about how the mass injection campaign is now targeting babies. “Where the FDA goes, Health Canada follows like the little corrupted lapdogs they are.”\n\n“It’s criminal to give these shots to babies and kids,” interjected someone else.\n\nSomeone else quoted Luke 17:1-2, which reads, citing the words of Jesus Christ himself:\n\n“Then said He unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone was hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones.”\n\nIf those who perpetrated and continue to perpetrate these crimes against humanity do not repent, then they deserve “nothing but incomprehensible, ineffable, unfathomable and unimaginable misery, pain, suffering, torment, wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Lake of Fire where the worm dies not and the fires are NEVER quenched,” this same commenter added, receiving an “Amen to that!” from another.\n\nThe latest news about the death toll from Fauci Flu shots can be found at Genocide.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nAlexBerenson.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "BIG PHARMA PAYDAY: US govt. mulls purchase of COVID vaccines that claim to target omicron\n\nThe U.S. is considering an additional purchase of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) clot shots for the population, this time the ones adapted for the B11529 omicron strain.\n\nA Russia Today report elaborated on the deal, saying that Washington is set to purchase additional COVID-19 vaccine doses from vaccine maker Pfizer tailored against omicron. The sale, amounting to more than $3 billion, could also include a new drug designed to protect against the more infectious yet milder strain, it added.\n\nAlongside its German partner BioNTech, the New York-based drug giant announced the deal on June 29. The two firms said they would ship an initial 105 million doses amounting to $3.2 billion. The contract, they added, also had an option for an additional 195 million doses should the federal government invoke it.\n\nBioNTech Chief Business and Chief Commercial Officer Sean Marrett said the agreement “will provide additional doses for U.S. residents and help cope with the next COVID-19 wave.” She added: “Pending regulatory authorization, it will also include an omicron-adapted vaccine, which we believe is important to address the rapidly spreading variant.”\n\nIn a press release, Pfizer elaborated on the omicron-specific vaccine and mentioned that it had actually been developing two vaccine candidates. Currently under review by federal regulators, the two candidates target the BA1 and BA4/BA5 omicron sub-variants.\n\nThe two companies mentioned that they had provided “pivotal data” on the safety and tolerability of the two vaccine candidates to the Food and Drug Administration. They also said that doses of both candidates have been manufactured in order to “begin deliveries rapidly upon authorization.”\n\n“We believe we have two very strong omicron-adapted candidates that elicit a substantially higher immune response than we’ve seen to date,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. He added that his company looks forward to “discussing these data with the scientific community and health authorities” with a view to introducing “an omicron-adapted booster as soon as possible if authorized by regulators.”\n\n“Omicron has newly evolving sub-lineages that … exhibit a trend of increasing potential for immune escape. We will therefore remain vigilant and are prepared to rapidly adapt our omicron-adapted vaccine candidates to emerging sub-lineages if epidemiological and laboratory data suggest,” said BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin. (Related: Del Bigtree: Rise in COVID cases from new omicron subvariants is something to watch out for.)\n\nDeadlier COVID variants targeting the vaccinated will soon emerge\n\nHowever, Belgian virologist Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche warned that the COVID-19 vaccines – such as the one by Pfizer – will only make people susceptible to a deadlier strain. This variant will mainly target nations with high vaccination rates, he added.\n\n“In the next two months, I expect an explosion [of this deadlier variant] in one of these highly vaccinated countries. And then, it will go very, very fast,” he told Australian independent journalist Maria Zeee in a May 18 interview.\n\n“You cannot play with an equilibrium that has been shaped over millions of years of evolution. Now all of a sudden, we throw a bombshell on this [natural immunity with] the mass vaccination – [as if] humankind is going to reshape this whole thing. Now, the virus is going to backfire in a way that is going to be very, very serious and very substantial.”\n\nInstead of injecting people with the vaccines, Vanden Bossche emphasized antiviral medications such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.\n\n“My heart goes out to all these people who have been highly vaccinated. [But] the magic word for these people is antivirals. It’s the only thing they can do – antivirals and, therefore, early treatments.”\n\n“Instead of having these stupid mass vaccination campaigns, we would need to have a mass antiviral chemoprophylaxis campaign in highly vaccinated countries to dramatically diminish the infection rate in the population – because that is what herd immunity naturally and normally does.”\n\nVisit VaccineWars.com for more stories about vaccines targeting the omicron strain.\n\nWatch Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche warning people not to take any vaccines against the omicron strain below.\n\nThis video is from the Soundpilot channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nExperts say Omicron is a “natural vaccine” – no need for any more boosters.\n\nHK experts: BioNTech Covid vaccine 32 times LESS effective against omicron.\n\nStudy confirms Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is USELESS against omicron variant.\n\nRepeated COVID vaccinations compromise body’s natural ability to fend off disease, resulting in VAIDS.\n\nDr. Geert Vanden Bossche predicts rise of DEADLIER COVID variants targeting the vaccinated in the next two months.\n\nSources include:\n\nSHTFPlan.com\n\nRT.com\n\nPfizer.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nvalue=\"Enter your email address here...\" style=\" border-radius: 2px; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 2em .2em;\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Enter your email address here...') { this.value = ''; }\" onblur=\"if(this.value == '') { this.value = 'Enter your email address here...'; }\" /> style=\"display: inline-block; outline: none; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; font: 14px/100% Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: .2em 1em .3em; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.3); -webkit-border-radius: .2em; -moz-border-radius: .2em; border-radius: .2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2); box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\" >\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe roll out of the Monkeypox “Plandemic” has been carefully planned and coordinated, much like the COVID Plandemic of 2020, including having simulations on how this “plandemic” will evolve, much like the 2019 Event 201 which simulated, with almost precision accuracy, how the COVID plandemic would evolve. See:\n\nThis past weekend the World Health Organization officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Kit Knightly of Off-Guardian.org reported:\n\nThe World Health Organization has officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Following their second emergency meeting on monkeypox in less than a month, WHO Director-General Thedros Adhanom told the press: In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations […] For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” For anyone living under a rock for the past two years, a PHEIC is defined as: an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response” It is the highest alert WHO can issue, and grants them legal authority to issue travel warnings or restrictions, inspect and critique the public health measures of member states and other things of that nature. Exactly what that means in this instance, and what form the “coordinated international response” will take, it is currently too early to tell. (Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop “plandemics”:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.”\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.” Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. “I would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven’t been used in this context and in this scale before,” Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nSupport the case against Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!\n\nIf you know people who are skeptical and cannot believe that medical kidnapping happens in the U.S. today, this is the book for them!

        "As the cost of essential goods rises faster than it has in decades, billionaires in the food and energy sectors are increasing their fortunes by $1 billion dollars every two days\n\nby OXFAM, Canada\n\nFor every new billionaire created during the pandemic — one every 30 hours — nearly a million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 at nearly the same rate, reveals a new Oxfam brief today.\n\n“Profiting from Pain” is published as the World Economic Forum in Davos takes place for the first time face-to-face since COVID-19, a period during which billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost to their fortunes.\n\nIn Canada, the wealth of billionaires has increased by 57.1 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic, in March 2020. The 41 richest billionaires own as much as the poorest 40 per cent of Canadians.\n\n“Billionaires gathered in Davos have enjoyed an obscene surge in their fortunes over the last two years. The pandemic and now the steep rise in food and energy prices have been a bonanza for the wealthiest, while millions of people face hunger and poverty as the cost living shoots up,” said Ian Thomson, manager of policy for Oxfam Canada.\n\nThe brief shows that 573 people became new billionaires during the pandemic, at the rate of one every 30 hours. We expect this year that 263 million more people will crash into extreme poverty, at a rate of a million people every 33 hours.\n\nBillionaires’ wealth has risen more in the first 24 months of COVID-19 than in 23 years combined. The total wealth of the world’s billionaires is now equivalent to 13.9 per cent of global GDP. This is a three-fold increase (up from 4.4 per cent) in 2000.\n\n“Billionaire wealth is growing because the super-rich have rigged the system for decades and are now reaping the benefits. The wealthiest — most of whom are men — are benefiting from privatization, pharmaceutical monopolies, fossil fuel subsidies and rollbacks of workers’ rights. Meanwhile, low-income people are working harder and earning less in pay,” said Thomson. “Inequality risks tearing apart our societies if we don’t stop it.”\n\nOxfam’s new research also reveals that corporations in the energy, food and pharmaceutical sectors — where monopolies are especially common — are posting record-high profits, even as wages have barely budged and workers struggle with decades-high prices amid COVID-19. The fortunes of food and energy billionaires have risen by $453 billion in the last two years, equivalent to $1 billion every two days. Five of the world’s largest energy companies (BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and Chevron) are together making $2,600 profit every second, and there are now 62 new food billionaires.\n\nFrom Sri Lanka to Sudan, record-high global food prices are sparking social and political upheaval. Sixty per cent of low-income countries are on the brink of debt distress. While inflation is rising everywhere, price hikes are particularly devastating for low-wage workers whose health and livelihoods were already most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly women, racialized and marginalized people. People in poorer countries spend more than twice as much of their income on food than those in rich countries.\n\nToday, 2,668 billionaires — 573 more than in 2020 — own $12.7 trillion, an increase of $3.78 trillion.\n\nThe world’s 10 richest men own more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of humanity, 3.1 billion people.\n\nThe richest 20 billionaires are worth more than the entire GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA worker in the bottom 50 per cent would have to work for 112 years to earn what a person in the top one per cent gets in a single year.\n\nThe pandemic has created 40 new pharma billionaires. Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer are making $1,000 profit every second just from their monopoly control of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite its development having been supported by billions of dollars in public investments. They are charging governments up to 24 times more than the potential cost of generic production. Eighty-seven per cent of people in low-income countries have still not been fully vaccinated.\n\n“The extremely rich and powerful are profiting from pain and suffering. This is unconscionable. Some have grown rich by denying billions of people access to vaccines, others by exploiting rising food and energy prices. They are paying out massive bonuses and dividends while paying as little tax as possible. This rising wealth and rising poverty are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to do,” said Thomson. “The Canadian government talks a good game about taxing extreme wealth inequality but we need to see more action. In the last two federal budgets, new taxes on luxury goods and increased tax rates on big banks have been announced but not implemented. The true test will be if Canada and other major economies find the political will to finally tax billionaire wealth.”\n\nRead the full report at OXFAM, Canada.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nSupport the case against Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!\n\nIf you know people who are skeptical and cannot believe that medical kidnapping happens in the U.S. today, this is the book for them!

(Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop “plandemics”:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.”\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.” Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. “I would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven’t been used in this context and in this scale before,” Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nSupport the case against Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!\n\nIf you know people who are skeptical and cannot believe that medical kidnapping happens in the U.S. today, this is the book for them!

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 46,618 deaths and 4,682,268 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines (details below).\n\nIn the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS) is now reporting 29,635 deaths and 1,350,950 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there has been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020. (833,968 cases, 9,279 deaths – source.)\n\n46,618 Deaths and 4,682,268 Injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,618 fatalities, and 4,682,268 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,126,925) are serious injuries.\n\n“Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started

women. (Source.)\n\nThis has to be the saddest, most criminal activity of Big Pharma and the FDA by allowing these COVID-19 shots to be injected into pregnant and young women.\n\nPfizer had data showing how dangerous these shots were for pregnant women, but the FDA gave authorization anyway.\n\nDr. Byram W. Bridle addressed this human tragedy on his blog earlier this week:\n\nI Am In Shock. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) had requested 75 years to release the documents that they reviewed from Pfizer prior to issuing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b mRNA ‘vaccine’ (Comirnaty) against SARS-CoV-2, which can cause COVID-19. However, a judge over-ruled this and issued a court order that the documents be released in large monthly installments. Today, an absolutely shocking set of data were brought to my attention. They are not new. They are from a document that was in the data dump released back in May of this year. However, I want to help my fellow scientists in making sure that this science gets widely distributed throughout the world. This is for the sake of ‘fully informed consent’, something that regulatory agencies, public health officials and too many physicians seem to have abandoned over the past couple of years. For a long time I have been arguing that our children need to be left out of the massive conflicts over the science underpinning COVID-19. In my opinion, adults can conduct their own risk-benefit analyses regarding whether they want to receive one of the current COVID-19 inoculations. However, far too many adults are making these decisions based on pseudo-science, data from flawed studies, misinformation, and outright disinformation being propagated by physicians and public health officials, many of whom are unqualified to opine on anything in the field of vaccinology. I have never felt comfortable about these injections being used in ‘children, adolescents and young-adults of child-bearing age’. This was the precise terminology I used in a parent’s guide to COVID-19 vaccines that I wrote more than one year ago. The highest quality data for assessing a novel medical product are derived from clinical studies. This is because these types of experiments in people are typically well-controlled and include what is known as ‘active monitoring’; there is follow-up to assess safety and efficacy. This is why the clinical testing phases should never be compromised. With this in mind, let’s explore a stunning set of data that Pfizer provided to the US-FDA. The data in this document were accumulated up until February 28, 2021. Notably, on page 9, safety concerns based on the US Pharmacovigilance Plan included “missing information” on “Use in Pregnancy and lactation”. The data that had accumulated up to the end of February, 2021 were from too small of a sample size (i.e., # of pregnant or lactating women) to justify its use in these populations. However, here are the data that were available at that time regarding outcomes in pregnant women that had received Pfizer’s COVID-19 inoculation; this is quoted from the top of table 6 (I have italicized and/or bolded the most important points)… Pregnancy cases: 274 cases including: • 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3 mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins). • Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted). Apparently, outcomes will never be known for 88% (238/270) of the pregnancies. Why was the follow-up rate on these cases so abysmal? NutriTruth has a great graph on their website that summarizes the results from cases for which follow-up data were available… It appears that data would be available for five of the pregnancies, but these outcomes were still unknown at the time that Pfizer’s document was written. As such, there are solid data available from 29 pregnancies. One out of 29 of these pregnancies resulted in a ‘normal’ outcome. This means that 28 out of the 29 babies died! That is a 97% death rate. I don’t care which trustworthy data set you look at to determine a ‘background’ death rate, none of them come close to 97%. Spontaneous abortions are more common than many people appreciate, but, again, they are nowhere near the rate in this study. Even in the case of the ‘normal outcome’, this means there was an apparently healthy baby. However, one cannot be certain that the outcome was ‘normal’, until the baby has had all of their physiological systems fully mature, which means early adulthood. I have looked at Pfizer’s pre-clinical reproductive toxicity data and they are fatally flawed. Issues included ‘vaccinating’ the females only; apparently it was forgotten that ‘it takes two to tango’. Also, the rodent models that were used express the low-affinity version of the receptor for the spike protein encoded by the ‘vaccines’. People express the high-affinity receptor. This means the rodent models aren’t capable of revealing toxicities that might be associated with the spike protein. In short, the pre-clinical studies could provide no assurance whatsoever that Pfizer’s vaccine would be safe in the context of pregnancy. Now there is proof that data were in the hands of regulatory agencies that suggested the potential for a 97% fatality rate for babies from ‘vaccinated’ women. I have collaborated with scientists and physicians about the post-rollout ‘real-world’ studies on pregnancy and the COVID-19 shots. They are highly flawed. I co-authored a paper about this, but have yet to find an editor that will even allow it to undergo peer review (I have had no problems with this for any of my cancer- or basic virology-focused papers). Regardless, many other reputable scientists and physicians have been addressing this. Further, these ‘real-world’ studies should never have been authorized based on the data presented here. Many countries have pushed Pfizer’s COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ on pregnant women, often via mandates. This was been done with the full blessing of their societies for obstetrics and gynecology. Are obstetricians and gynecologists going to continue to make these recommendations with these data in-hand? At the end of the day, couples experiencing pregnancies or who wish to do so must make it their own responsibility to educate themselves to facilitate fully informed consent. Too many obstetricians and gynecologists are either too superficially trained in the immunological sub-discipline of vaccinology or are too afraid of contradicting a narrative for which dissent is punished. Some physicians are starting to speak up about this. Unfortunately, their singular personal observations are simply deemed anecdotal. However, as a scientist, I have been trained to observe the cumulative nature of these reports; to not dismiss them out-of-hand, and to use them to formulate legitimate scientific questions. If you or your baby have experienced any issues post-inoculation, please report these to your physician. They are obligated to submit an adverse event report, without opining on whether or not they think it might or might not be related. The accumulation of these reports is the only way scientists can help identify safety signals during a public rollout of a novel medical product. A 97% death rate among babies from pregnant mothers that were ‘vaccinated’ is appalling. And this was from Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. This suggests a massive breakdown in the health regulatory process. The public, whom health regulatory agencies are to be serving, should demand accountability from these government-run institutions. If I were a regulatory scientist assessing the pregnancy outcome data from Pfizer, there is no way that I would ever have supported the use of their inoculation in pregnant women. And I would never have allowed ‘real-world’ data from flawed studies to replace proper pre-clinical and clinical trials. Nor would I remain silent about this knowledge. Regulators who know better need to start speaking up.\n\nRead the full article at COVID Chronicles.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper was recently interviewed where she stated:\n\n“For a first-trimester woman to get this injection, they have more of a chance of having a miscarriage or stillbirth than if they were to actually take an abortifacient.”\n\n2 Young Mothers Talk About Losing Their Unborn Babies Just After a COVID-19 Vaccine:\n\nReports of Brain Damage, Seizures, Bowel Disease Continue for Babies 6 Months Old to 4 Years Old\n\nAnother 103 records of COVID-19 vaccine injuries were added to VAERS yesterday (July 22, 2022) for the 6-month to 4-years-old age group, continuing to show horrible side effects that include brain injuries, anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, eye infections, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes, since these shots were approved for this age group a few weeks ago, in June.\n\nI put the latest 103 records on the second page here. I read through every one of them, and I have to admit that emotionally, it is not an easy thing to do.\n\nSome “highlights” from the write-ups of these infants who were injected.\n\nA 6-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2370120:\n\nwithin 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing; within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend and describes the occurrence of RESPIRATORY ARREST – On 30-Jun-2022, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening) and LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant).\n\nA 4-year-old boy from VAERS ID 2369485:\n\nThursday, July 7th, I picked him up from school and walked him home. He only ate part of his fig bar because he said it didn”t taste good. He also didn”t want any dinner which is very rare. He said that his tummy hurt. I assumed it was the fig bar. He finally ate 2 bites of soup but didn”t want any more. When I brushed his teeth I only brushed half because he said it hurt. He went to bed pretty easily but he looked so exhausted. About 10:00pm he woke up and he was sweaty and clammy. He wasn”t feeling well and seemed a bit delirious because he didn”t realize I was really in the room with him as I rocked him. He cried about his tummy hurting and pointed to below his belly button. He cried and said he wanted to go home. He didn”t realize he was home.\n\nA 3-year-old girl from VAERS ID 2366237:\n\nThe night of the vaccine, she developed a fever and woke up. She has had a fever ever since the vaccine. She is lethargic and will not eat. I took her to the urgent care on 7/8/2022. She had a strep and COVID-19 test that were negative. Her highest fever was 104. I also took her to the ER yesterday. She is currently still sick.\n\nA one and a half year old boy from VAERS ID 2365977:\n\nAfter receiving vaccination, patient was out of it for approximately ~15 mins, after that period seemed lethargic but otherwise normal. Patient showed no other adverse reaction until time for his nap at 12:40p, when he felt warm to the touch but underarm temperature reading was 98.7. He woke up atypically early at 2:50p, but laid in crib seemingly playing quietly. At 3:56p, mother heard whimpering sound and went to check on patient who was convulsing and unconscious until EMS arrived at 4:03p, he was very hot but EMS was unable to get an accurate temperature reading. Convulsions stopped when paramedics arrived at approx. 4:03p and patient was unresponsive for an additional approx. 10 mins. Patient was placed under ice by EMS and had a temperature reading of 102.4 when he arrived Hospital in approx 20-30 mins later.\n\nA six-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2362981:\n\n24 hours post-vaccine baby had a BRUE (brief resolved unexplained event). While changing his diaper he went unresponsive and I questioned if he was breathing. I startled him back with shouting his name. He then became unresponsive again. This occurred 4-5 times over 1-2 minutes. I attempted startling and tryingg go to get a reaction and he became alert again. I took him to the ER where he was diagnosed as having a BRUE and was kept on monitors overnight.\n\nI shudder to think what awaits those in the future who allow these little ones to suffer so much. “Vengeance is mine” says the Lord, and there will be justice.\n\nRescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?

        "edit on 23-7-2022 by RegularJo76 because: (no reason given)\n\n\n\nI know that people here like to blame Biden for all of our woes ever since coronavirus but I see few talking about Trump's role in all of this as well. Trump was a lifelong Democrat up until he ran as a Republican in 2016.It could be argued that Trump is the FACE of American capitalism as he has been a famous billionaire for decades and is seen as a genius businessman. He's the face of the 1%.There has been the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind ever since the coronavirus and the policies to counteract it were implemented. The rich have gotten EXPONENTIALLY richer since 2020. Elon Musk has increased his net worth almost ten times over since 2020! That is only the most egregious example, pretty much every other giant corporation got richer during the plandemic.The coronavirus is such an obvious cash grab by the elites to anyone who is paying attention. EVERYTHING has gotten more expensive for YOU and ME while those inflating their prices are making RECORD profits. They sit cushy in their mansions while we are paying double for gas.When Trump was elected in 2016 he created a new office called the \"Strategic and Policy Forum\". Who was appointed the chair of this \"forum\" of billionaires? Stephen Schwarzman, a lifelong Democrat and the CEO of Blackstone, a HUGE investment company that manages $41.2 BILLION dollars in assets around the globe. You know, your typical GLOBALIST company that has HUGE sway over global economic policy.Fast forward to the coronavirus in 2020. Who does Trump pick to lead the economic response to the coronavirus? A man named Larry Fink, yet another lifelong Democrat who is the CEO of yet ANOTHER global investment company called BlackRock. This company manages a total of $177 BILLION in global assets and is the largest asset management company in the world. Yet another globalist handpicked to oversee our economic response to the coronavirus.How has our response to coronavirus worked out so far? Why is Trump, supposedly a red blooded conservative fighting for conservative rights, electing lifelong DEMOCRATS to lead our policy and coronavirus response?Blackstone and BlackRock. How fitting that the names are so similar to one another. Very likely symbolic. Speaking of symbolism Trump caught the \"China virus\", something that he called \"a gift from God\", and was miraculously healed within days by taking a cocktail made by Regeneron. He was cured by Regeneron yet endorses the vaccine and calls it one of the greatest achievements of mankind. Why is he taking the vaccine if he already knows the Regeneron cocktail works like a charm? Isn't that STRANGE? There's something symbolic in that, as is his photoshoot on front of the church with an upside down bible. Don't ask me what it means though.If Trump is such a huge threat to the elites then why are they curing him of coronavirus within days with a drug that hardly anyone else has had or even thought about since he was cured? Doesn't that seem weird to you? Jeffrey Epstein is six feet under but Trump apparently has plot armor. Give me a break.Look at Trump's campaign manager while running for president. David Bossie, the president and chairman of Citizens United, the advocacy group that fought for corporations' \"rights\" to bribe our politicians with unlimited money anonymously and won! He fought for the elites' \"right\" to turn politicians into their little mouthpieces.Add Biden's totally inept administration making things even worse and you've got a REAL conspiracy on your hands. Almost as if the stars aligned for the rich and powerful to rob everyone and make a clean getaway, barely any resistance as we were too busy fighting over all the other distractions they spew over the media.Where's all that stimulus money gone? Sucked to the top. All that money printed just to be siphoned into offshore bank accounts. I certainly don't see that money anymore and 99% of other people don't either.Trump owns the coronavirus and our response to it, his appointment of globalist billionaire CEO's to strategic policy positions goes to show that he's in on the whole charade, nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing.Trump was the perfect candidate to usher in the biggest wealth (and thus power) transfer in human history. He caused SO many distractions with his antics and gave the media SO much material that we have taken our eyes off the ball."

How dare you question the health (which a WH doc says is like a horse in its prime) of the leader of the enslaved world. Whoopsa reply to: carewemust"

        "Was this plandemic ever a pandemic? How can it be a pandemic if only the by the WEF undermined nations are affected and ore than 100 nations worldwide didn´t and don´t care for that BS and didn´t extinct? Before 2009 that BS wouldn`t have worked because the WHO first had to weaken the definition of a pandemic so they could start their first test balloon with the swine flu BS and it`s BS vaccinations.They only had to wait around ten years so the majority of the people had completely forgotten that we witnessed the same BS like that corona BS before with that swine flu BS. We have even the same actors and profiteers in that corona crime now like in that swine flu crime a decade before.How can millions or even billions of people WEF/WHO-world wide forget all that and fall again for the same BS ten years later?\"In April 2009, the WHO weakened the definition of a pandemic, omitting the passage requiring a \"significant number of deaths. Based on these \"updated pandemic criteria, the organization declared swine flu a pandemic (level 6) on June 11, 2009, about seven weeks after the first infection became known.At that time, as WHO Director-General Margaret CHAN has just reiterated, the number of deaths worldwide was low. The organization had also \"not seen or expected a sudden or dramatic increase in the number or severity of infections. Nor could there be any question of a \"large-scale, transnational pandemic,\" as defined in this country's National Pandemic Plan. The pandemic was not a \"major pandemic. Thus, the classification of swine flu as a pandemic - tantamount to the go-ahead for vaccine production and further stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors - would not have been possible without redefinition.However, the Director-General emphasizes that the \"accusations that WHO changed the pandemic definition to align it (for the benefit of industry) with a less severe event are not based on fact. The current pandemic plan had already been finalized in February 2009 after two years of deliberation, when the new H1N1 virus was not yet in sight. This is probably beyond doubt. However, the fact that the threshold for declaring a pandemic and thus for early drug purchases costing billions of dollars has been lowered can be interpreted as a consequence of pandemic planning with experts who have corresponding conflicts of interest.\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!"

Germany returns to darkness.\n\nPolice randomly target, pick off peaceful demonstrators and strollers. Symbol photo. Source: Freie Niedersachsen\n\nAs Germany scrambles to stifle the growing grassroots movement against COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates, authorities are resorting to ever more extreme tactics to snuff out the people’s right to dissent.\n\nOne retired German professor recounts his own experience.\n\n===========================\n\nBy Prof. Dr. Stefan Homburg\n\nOriginally published at Reitschuster.de\n\n[Hanover] Yesterday, the Monday after New Year’s Day, 2022, I wanted to watch for the first time one of the “walks” now taking place by the thousands all over Germany as the authorities have banned demonstrations.\n\nI know from the newspaper that the police have issued a general order on FFP2 masks to make it easier to take tougher action against walkers. The medical bogus arguments are no longer used, so I put a mask in my pocket.\n\nAt the Town Hall, the designated meeting place, I can only see a huge police contingent. I stroll alone to the state parliament, where a large group of people are being detained and requested to assign a leader of the meeting. I stay away from that and continue to Hanover’s Kröpcke central square, where on this mild January evening several hundred people can be found, most of them on their way to or from the shops.\n\nKeeping an eye out for possible walkers, I stop for a moment and a lady standing next to me abruptly says she hasn’t been downtown for ages because of lockdowns and masks. As I feel the same way, we admire the Christmas decorations together for half a minute. As I want to move on, there are suddenly five police officers in front of us and, as I turn around, about ten to fifteen behind us, forming a ring around the lady, myself and maybe eight other, mostly older people. Asked what this means, a blonde policewoman answers me that she hereby declares us an [illegal] assembly. I immediately put on my FFP2 mask, am honestly shocked and reply that this is probably a civic prank. As a result of the police presence and the crowd that has formed, there are now many spectators in the square, and basically any group of people could be surrounded from behind and declared an “assembly”.\n\nAn acquaintance who happens to be passing by wants to join me, but she is not allowed into police-surrounded group, and I am not allowed out. More and more police officers arrive, also spectators, and the whole scene is getting filmed many times over. I also receive shouts from people who recognize me and express their surprise at this strange measure. The term “fascism” gets used, and the police officers are verbally attacked harshly by the bystanders.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, things get serious: I am taken away by three men, and when I ask what I am accused of, I get the answer: violation of the obligation to wear a mask. I reply that I am wearing one, even FFP2, and have been since the group formed. But it is of no use: I should have been wearing the mask before the group formed, and that they have photos to prove that this was not the case.\n\nNow that I am away from the others, I only notice out of the corner of my eye that the others who are not wearing masks are far worse off. Maybe because they just wanted to walk through the city and for that reason didn’t have one with them. In any case, I hear commotion and screams, but as a detained person I cannot investigate. After taking my personal details, the police tell me that proceedings will be taken against me and that I am banished from the entire city center. Yet, the police officer in charge is unable to define the boundaries of the area. Instead, he threatens me with imprisonment in case of a violation.\n\nTwo conclusions Firstly, the police can, through underhanded singling out, pin a case on anyone who is outside their home, and that is probably the point of the action. Secondly, if this cannot be called fascism, where does it actually begin – or to put it another way, what more do we actually want to put up with?

        "Most of the narratives surrounding the covid pandemic and the lockdowns were illogical and faulty, based in propaganda rather than science and fear instead of reason. One key issue that was never addressed by lockdown proponents was the question of “risk.” Doesn't every individual have a natural right to take whatever risks they see as acceptable when it comes to their own health? If a group of people want to go to a church service and take the risk that they might get covid, don't they have the right to do that?\n\nOf course, lockdown supporters will claim that those refusing to comply with mandates don't have a right to put “other people at risk,” but how much risk from covid is there really?\n\nAccording to dozens of independent and peer reviewed studies from around the world, the actual “risk” of death from covid is limited. Studies indicate that the median Infection Fatality Rate (or Ratio) of covid is between 0.23% and 0.27% of the population. This is the contrary mainstream science that the media rarely talks about.\n\nSo, 99.7% of all people (according to the science) on average face no mortal risk from the worst variants of covid. IFR is in most cases the most accurate statistic on the death rate of a virus because it accounts for asymptomatic cases. Case Fatality Rate (CFR), the stat often used more by the mainstream media, does not. Even the World Health Organization notes on its website that: “The true severity of a disease can be described by the Infection Fatality Ratio...”\n\nWhen comparing covid to a virus like the Spanish Flu, which killed over 50 million people worldwide according to the CDC, one would think that there would be a measure of apprehension when it comes to violating the freedoms of the public. Nope. The relatively low level of risk associated with covid made no difference to governments or global institutions. They charged forward like bulls in a china shop breaking everything in their path and treating unilateral “mandates” as if they were laws.\n\nLuckily, the tide has been slowly turning back and resistance to lockdowns and vaccine passports has been more pervasive than many officials seem to have expected. In most conservative states within the US, the lockdowns ended quickly, within a few months in many cases, once it was realized that covid was not the population killer that the media, the CDC and the WHO had made it out to be. Leftist blue states and countries like Canada were not so lucky.\n\nCanadian Pastor Artur Pawlowski experienced the full brunt of medical authoritarianism first hand when, on May 9, 2021, he sought to hold a church service for his congregants only to be arrested along with his brother Dawid Pawlowski for “inciting an in-person gathering.”\n\nIn October of 2021, a Judge ruled that the Pastor was in violation of a covid health order. The punishment was bizarre and Orwellian; he was heavily fined, and whenever he spoke publicly about covid he would be required to recite a government-approved statement saying that \"most medical experts support social distancing, face masks, and vaccines.\" When the court says “most experts,” they are of course referring to government paid “experts.” There are many medical experts that disagree with the efficacy of the lockdowns and other mandates.\n\nResearchers, with over 18,000 studies and after four levels of screening, found 24 papers that would provide a stringent comparison of lockdown effects. They found that lockdowns reduced covid mortality in the United States and Europe by only 0.2 percent on average. They also looked at forced shelter-in-place, which reduced mortality by only 2.9 percent on average.\n\nThe researchers had this final conclusion:\n\n“While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted. In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.”\n\nThis week an appeals court ruled that the Alberta Health Agency’s order prohibiting “illegal public gatherings” was “not sufficiently clear and unambiguous” in connection to the Pawlowskis.\n\n“The Pawlowskis’ appeals are allowed. The finding of contempt and the sanction order are set aside. The fines that have been paid by them are to be reimbursed,” the three-member panel proclaimed in a 16-page ruling.\n\nPawlowski grew up under communist rule in Poland and this is likely the root of his refusal to comply. He's seen all of this before, including the typical religious persecution inherent in communist societies.\n\nThe legal victory is a clear reminder that the fear surrounding potential crisis events is often exploited and abused by governments to erase personal freedoms and legal protections. It is these moments in history when individual rights are MORE important, not less, because whenever there is a crisis the worst types of tyrants tend to come out of the woodwork."

        "Andrew Wiggins #22 of the Golden State Warriors poses for a portrait during the Golden State Warriors Media Day at Chase Center in San Francisco, Calif. on Sept. 27, 2021. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nNBA Champion Says He Regrets Getting COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nGolden State Warriors forward and NBA Champion Andrew Wiggins suggested he regrets getting the COVID-19 vaccine during the 2021–2022 season, even though he won a championship.\n\n“I still wish I didn’t get it (the vaccinate), to be honest with you,” Wiggins, 27, told FanSided this week.\n\nWiggins said that the only way he would be able to play last season is if he got the shot due to San Francisco’s COVID-19 rules around vaccines. Throughout the season, he refused to get the shot and claimed a religious exemption before he was ultimately denied and had to receive the vaccine in October in order to play.\n\n“I did it,” he said, referring to getting the shot. “And I was an All-Star this year and champion, so that was the good part, just not missing out on the year, the best year of my career,” Wiggins added, but he stated that he was forced to get the shot against his will.\n\n“But for my body, I just don’t like putting all that stuff in my body, so I didn’t like that. … It wasn’t my choice. I didn’t like that it was either get this or don’t play,” Wiggins said.\n\nWiggins previously said he is the only member of his family that received the COVID-19 vaccine, saying that “it’s not really something we believe in.”\n\nOther Players\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, because he wouldn’t take the vaccine, was denied the ability to play for his team during home games throughout much of the season. Several months ago, New York City Mayor Eric Adams rolled back the city’s vaccination requirement for athletes, allowing him to play.\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) walks onto the court after a time-out during the second half against the Charlotte Hornets at Barclays Center. (Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports)\n\n“I can really say that I stood firm on what I believed in, what I wanted to do with my body,” Irving told ESPN earlier this year. “I think that should be not just an American right, I think that should be a human right.”\n\nIrving added that “I was called so many different names. … It was part of a struggle of mine to look at the season, a game that I love—my job.”\n\n“I can’t even keep calling it a game, it’s my job—[for] that to be stripped away based on a mandate or something that was in place,” he said.\n\nJonathan Isaac #1 of the Orlando Magic stands as others kneel before the start of a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Orlando Magic on July 31, 2020. (Ashley Landis/Getty Images)\n\nThe Orlando Magic’s Jonathan Isaac, meanwhile, similarly declined the vaccine, remarking that “it felt forced.”\n\n“Viewing it, it seemed forced,” Isaac said during an interview. “It seemed that there was so much pressure in doing it. I don’t see the wisdom in putting something into my body that’s not going to stop me from getting the virus or transmitting it. That is why I decided to be the only player on my team to not get vaccinated.”"

        "Scientists keep reminding people that pathogens can become trapped on face masks and that the masks should be sterilized between use. So one popular question that has come up lately is, ‘can ultraviolet (UV) light do the job?’\n\nWe’ve seen UV’s powerful benefits before. Cutting-edge technology has been used to sterilize hospitals in state-of-the-art facilities for years. This technique even made headlines when Ebola was scaring the world.\n\nFrom LA Times:\n\nIdeally, single-use face masks should be worn once and then thrown away, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s certainly true of the top-of-the-line N95 masks used by healthcare workers that are designed to filter out 95% of tiny particles when properly fitted to a wearer’s face.\n\nBut last week, the CDC released new guidance on decontamination methods for emergency situations, such as the one healthcare workers are facing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any disinfection process would need to kill the coronavirus without harming an N95 mask’s ability to filter particles or fit snugly to the skin.\n\nUltraviolet germicidal radiation is one of the methods presented by the CDC, and UV light has generated great interest from the public. It’s already used in hospitals to disinfect contaminated surfaces. And there’s a fairly robust market of devices aimed at consumers, such as disinfectants for sleep apnea machines (although no such devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration so far). Other products purport to clean cellphones and disinfect water bottles.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what ultraviolet light is and why it could be a useful tool in combating the coronavirus in certain situations.\n\nWhat is UV light?\n\nUltraviolet light, also known as UV light, is invisible to humans. Though it’s adjacent to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, its wavelengths are just too short for our eyes to register and see.\n\nUV rays are also high-energy, so while we can’t see them, we certainly feel their effects. For instance, ultraviolet light generated by the sun is what gives you a tan — or a sunburn. It can also lead to skin cancer.\n\nUltraviolet light falls into three categories, according to the World Health Organization:\n\n• UVA: This is the lowest-energy form of UV, and it accounts for about 95% of the ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth from the sun. It can penetrate deep into the skin’s layers, which makes it responsible for the early tanning effect. It also contributes to skin aging, wrinkling and possibly skin cancer.\n\n• UVB: This higher-energy type of ultraviolet light can permeate the skin’s superficial layers. It’s responsible for delayed tanning (and burning), and is a big contributor to skin cancer and aging. Most of the UVB that comes our way is absorbed by the Earth’s ozone layer, so it only makes up about 5% of the solar UV that reaches Earth.\n\n• UVC: The highest-energy category of ultraviolet light — any higher and you’d be in X-ray territory — is also the most damaging. Luckily, the ozone layer and atmosphere completely absorb it.\n\nThe UV light used in medical disinfection devices is a particular wavelength of UVC.\n\nHow does UV disinfect stuff?\n\nUltraviolet light can penetrate the cells of pathogens and damage the DNA or RNA that contain their genetic code, said Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that UV can damage the amino acids and proteins that either protect the virus or allow it to attach to and infect a host cell.\n\nSo it’s already in use?\n\nYes. People have been disinfecting things with UV for more than a century, according to Ron Hofmann, an environmental engineer at the University of Toronto.\n\nMany experts say the first full-scale UV disinfection system for water treatment was used in Marseilles, France, in 1910, Malley said.\n\nModern UV devices come in a range of shapes and sizes. Some are not much bigger than cellphones. Others can be as large as a Cadillac Escalade — or multiple Escalades parked nose to bumper, in the case of the systems used to disinfect drinking water in Los Angeles and New York, Malley said.\n\nMany midsize UV machines — about the size of a large garbage bin — are used in hospitals to disinfect patients’ rooms after they’ve left.\n\nMore from new.yahoo.com\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

        "Experts have repeatedly told us that the best way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to avoid physical distance with sick people. But that’s pretty difficult to achieve in modern society, where more than half the world’s population lives in urban areas, using public transport, eating in the same restaurants, drinking together in pubs, and interacting in a myriad other ways every single day.\n\nSince the COVID-19 virus is so incredibly contagious, public areas frequented by large groups of people, as well as hospital rooms that have been used by sick patients, need to be carefully disinfected.\n\nRobots that can disinfect these areas by utilizing the power of the sun’s ultraviolet rays are the latest weapon in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhy ultraviolet light is the right weapon against COVID-19\n\nThe sun is an incredibly powerful natural disinfectant; its ultraviolet rays are strong enough to kill most harmful bacteria on exposed skin or clothing by destroying the nucleic acids in bacteria and other types of microbes.\n\nAs reported by The Epoch Times, concentrated UVC light has already been used for over five decades as an effective disinfectant in the manufacture of many different beverages, as well as for disinfecting fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, frozen foods and baked goods.\n\nNow, robots using this same type of light are being used to safely disinfect hospital rooms that have housed COVID-19 patients, as well as other public areas.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, though this technology has been available for some time, the coronavirus has “rocketed” demand for these special robots.\n\nAn employee disinfects a Johannesburg, South Africa, hospital with a robot that emits ultraviolet light. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sam Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, “truckloads” of these robots have already been shipped to China, and more recently demand has escalated in other parts of the world.\n\nThe BBC reported:\n\nProduction has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark’s third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub.\n\nGlowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can’t multiply. …\n\nThe job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there’s a smell, much like burned hair.\n\nAs explained by The Epoch Times, Klaran, another firm that specializes in UVC LED products, has developed a robot that uses wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers (UVC) to effectively disinfect against pathogens.\n\nAnd Dimer UVC Innovation, based in Los Angeles, has developed a robot that can disinfect up to 10 hospital rooms in a single hour.\n\nThe Epoch Times reported:\n\nDimer just announced that it will offer GermFalcon robots designed to autonomously navigate through airplane cabins and passenger terminal waiting areas to strategically ‘kill viruses, bacteria, and superbugs’ on high-touch surfaces.\n\nCo-founder Elliot Kreitenberg stated the Dimer germ-killing system will participate in the coronavirus emergency response efforts at the Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nProf Hans Jørn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark, explains that many different organisms can cause infections, but that the correct dose of ultraviolet light, applied for an appropriate length of time, will kill most of them.\n\nHe added, “This type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.”\n\nSources:\n\nTheepochtimes.com\n\nBBC.com\n\nCredit: Naturalnews.com\n\nImage: Flickr/NIAID\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

        "By Catherine Yang, The Epoch Times\n\nWhile The Epoch Times began publishing reports of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus on Jan. 2, most outlets had yet to pick up on the story because of the CCP’s lockdown on information. Three months later, over 200 countries and territories have been infected and the CCP virus has caused over 85,000 deaths infecting at least 1.4 million, but information is murkier than ever.\n\n“We’ve pretty much heard every rumor under the sun. We’ve heard every theory, every crazy rumor, we’ve heard all these different narratives,” said Joshua Philipp, award-winning investigative reporter and host of the show “Crossroads.”\n\nThe rumors aren’t by accident: The CCP has been actively engaging in a disinformation campaign, and media outlets around the world have parroted the propaganda. As a result, entire nations have been operating under false information as they try to battle the pandemic within their borders.\n\nScreenshot of the documentary “Tracking Down the Origin of Wuhan Coronavirus.” (Courtesy Epoch Times)\n\nPhilipp and his colleages at The Epoch Times and NTD Television thought it their responsibility to sift through all the information available, verify it, and put it into one place. The result is the just-premiered documentary “Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus,” which is available to watch online. Less than two days after its premiere, the documentary has around 1.6 million views across different platforms.\n\nThe film “really tries to sift through all of the rumors, all of the truths, all of the falsehoods, and show people as accurate a picture as possible of what really happened and where this virus actually came from,” Philipp said.\n\nIn it, Philipp pieces together the development of the virus and includes interviews that shed light on the Chinese regime’s actions and intentions.\n\nLives at Stake\n\nIt should be very telling that the nine-person panel the CCP created to address the pandemic, once it finally acknowledged the virus in January, is filled with propaganda officials, said China affairs columnist Gordon Chang in the documentary.\n\nMany countries have accepted or bought faulty equipment from China, for example, and “they’re getting duped,”Philipp said.\n\n“And, of course, this is because they don’t understand the Chinese Communist Party, they don’t understand how [the CCP] works, and, even as we speak right now, the Chinese Communist Party is claiming it’s over in China when it’s not.”\n\nChina affairs columnist Gordon Chang. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n“And what that means is, as they open things up and reopen flights, there’s a major risk to other countries,” Philipp said. “If [these countries] don’t have accurate information, then what can they base their information on?”\n\nAs the documentary shows, the CCP’s delay in sharing information about the virus with other countries was not mere oversight. And beyond covering up the epidemic, China’s current actions and disinformation continues to endanger lives around the globe. The CCP has gone from denying the existence of the virus to spreading as many lies as it can to obscure the truth.\n\n“This is an issue of human life,” Philipp said.\n\nWhy Would the CCP Lie?\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP has not been forthcoming.\n\n“We don’t know what’s there, but the fact that the Communist Party is covering this up should trouble us deeply,” Chang said.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the CCP will likely be shocked to discover the regime’s motives.\n\nPhilipp’s investigation of the CCP virus in this documentary goes back to the outbreak of SARS nearly two decades ago. The CCP tried to cover up the SARS outbreak as well, and The Epoch Times was one of the few media to expose this. There is precedent of the regime being untrustworthy in the event of an epidemic.\n\nPhilipp has been researching the CCP since 2008, and gave an example of its military approach to shed light on how the CCP can profit off this pandemic most consider a tragedy.\n\n“One important thing to understand is they talk about war without morals. They talk about ‘unrestricted warfare’: war that does not take into account any concept of human rights, human dignity, human life. It is victory by any means. There is nothing they will not do, and we see the same thing in many parts of their system, including the medical system where altering the human genome is not a big deal to them,”Philipp said.\n\nThe documentary’s experts remind us: this is a nation that currently holds at least 1 million of its own people in concentration camps.\n\n“They don’t care about human life when it comes to this regime—we’ve seen that in their human rights abuses,” Philipp said.\n\nEpoch Times investigative journalist Joshua Philipp. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\nThe documentary shows another link to SARS, and how one of China’s top virus experts’ study of SARS at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to breakthroughs in creating a coronavirus to infect humans. But to what end?\n\n“The Chinese Communist Party has been very open about its biological warfare ambitions, they don’t even try to hide it. And it’s been a huge injustice that people have not held them to stronger account than they should have, because the Chinese Communist Party is able to act with impunity and nobody criticizes what they do,” Philipp said.\n\nThe documentary is a comprehensive look at what the virus is and what has happened, and Philipp hopes it can allow nations to make better-informed decisions.\n\nDr. Sean Lin, former lab director of the viral disease branch at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n“At the very least, we can provide this as a package of information that will inform the entire world exactly where this virus came from, and exactly what needs to be done going forward,” he said. “And at the very least, they will be more cautious when dealing with the Chinese Communist Party, especially at this time.” “People’s lives are at stake and we find it very necessary to do this kind of work,” he said.\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe information is perhaps more vital than ever, because while countries are turning to the World Health Organization for information, WHO is turning to the CCP.\n\nGeneral Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former National Security Council senior strategy director, was in China when SARS broke out; he was evacuated, but he knows what a cover-up looks like. How the CCP handled the SARS cover-up is exactly how they have handled this one. He is among several experts who say the CCP clearly has no intention of ending the epidemic or curing the virus.\n\nSenior investigative Epoch Times reporter Joshua Philipp in New York City. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n“You can see that the WHO is essentially following the Chinese Communist Party’s guidelines,” Spalding said.\n\nThe WHO isn’t the only organization doing so; international organizations to individual academic institutions around the world are afraid to say something that may anger the CCP. In recent weeks, Philipp had reached out many well-known scientists who once suggested the virus causing this mysterious COVID-19 disease was created in a lab, but they no longer wanted to talk.\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP prevented organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying the origin of COVID-19, Gordon Chang said.\n\nThe CCP’s actions speak to a problem deeper than the virus.\n\n“Every country has diseases, but in China they become national emergencies and global emergencies, because the real disease here is communism,” Chang said.\n\nWatch the complete documentary below:\n\nSource: The Epoch Times\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

        "As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of citizens\n\nThe “health code” service – run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government – give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities.\n\nThe apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.\n\nThe apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.\n\nSome restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport.\n\nHowever, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people’s private lives and data.\n\nThere have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous “red” designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance.\n\n“Why should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?” said one user.\n\n“Can’t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people’s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don’t know what leaders are thinking?”\n\nThe apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person’s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19.\n\nAccording to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software.\n\nOfficial guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as “the history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident”.\n\nIt draws on medical information including “symptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area”, and the user’s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver.\n\nThe health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as “Alipay Health code” spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths.\n\nAccording to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3/28/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light.\n\nAlthough the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it.\n\nExperts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations.\n\nFrom International Business Times:\n\nA New Symptom\n\nThe throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms.\n\nMichael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains.\n\nStomach Pain And Pneumonia\n\nAccording to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients’ lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area.\n\nDr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough.\n\nNo Respiratory Symptoms\n\nThe general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain. On the other hand, it is the older patients who show respiratory symptoms.\n\nAccording to health experts, common symptoms of COVID-19 are having a high temperature, shortness of breathing, and a new, continuous cough. Some patients reported having diarrhea and suffering from conjunctivitis (pink eye), which health experts later on attributed to coronavirus infection.\n\nSources:\n\nIBTimes.com\n\nworldometers.info/coronavirus/country/US\n\nrealfarmacy.com\n\nworldometers.info/coronavirus\n\nCDC.gov\n\nImages: U.S. Army photo by Reese Brown\n\nAndrea Canali EFE\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

        "Ninety miles south of Phoenix is an airport located in the middle of the Arizona desert just off of an isolated strip of I-10. With only one runway and no passenger terminal, Pinal Air Park doesn’t see commercial airline service but it is home to some of the most iconic aircraft ever to roam the skies.\n\nKnown in the industry as an aircraft boneyard, Pinal Air Park is where aircraft are housed for long-term storage. In other words, it’s a retirement home of sorts for grounded airliners whose time has come as newer, younger planes take their place in airline fleets across the world.\n\nAt the airfield in Marana, Arizona, the skeletons of old workhorses, including some from airlines that do not exist anymore, can be found baking in the desert sun. While their time in the sky has long passed, their parts continue to prove useful to current sky-bound aircraft.\n\nThough most aircraft that enter storage in Marana never take to the skies again, the COVID-19 crisis has given the town a slew of new arrivals that airlines hope will only be temporary visitors rather permanent residents.\n\nTake a look at which aircraft some of the world’s airlines are sending to the Arizona desert to ride out the industry downturn caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nPinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona is one the many aircraft boneyards located in the American Southwest, a region known for its hot, dry climates that help preserve aircraft.\n\nRead More\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article"

        "As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.\n\nThe first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5\n\nLess than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. — 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, “The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out ‘all the stops’” to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.\n\nAll told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7\n\nCOVID-19 — A Weaponized Coronavirus?\n\nIn this interview, Francis Boyle — whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science — shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.\n\nFor decades, he’s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.\n\nAt the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.\n\nAs a result of Boyle’s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed “mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world” that have appeared since then.\n\n“My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.\n\nEven though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,” Boyle says.\n\n“So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.\n\nThere is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It’s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.\n\nThere have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.\n\nFor that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.”\n\nMany Unknowns Remain\n\nThe first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it’s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it’s 30 days, Boyle says.\n\n“As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they’re basically under martial law. There’s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they’ve made it very clear they’re at war here, and that is correct. They’re at war with their own biological warfare agent.\n\nPresident Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People’s Liberation Army] forces saying they’re health care workers. They don’t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that’s my best reading of the situation.”\n\nWhen asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\n\n“It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.\n\nWe do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n\nWinnipeg is Canada’s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It’s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don’t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.\n\nThey had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven’t seen before.\n\nIts lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.\n\nIt has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we’ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n\nI want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I’ve never had a security clearance. I’ve never had access to any type of secret information.\n\nI just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that’s what I’m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.\n\nRight now, I’m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they’ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.”\n\nDespite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons.\n\nAccording to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as “WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n\n“I won’t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There’s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,” Boyle says.\n\n“As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It’s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran …\n\nOf course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein’s biological warfare facilities, and that’s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons …\n\n[It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.”\n\nAccording to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\n\n“Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.\n\nThat is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.\n\nI spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did …\n\nI want to make it clear I’m not here to speak in their name, I’m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, ‘Biological Warfare and Terrorism,’ professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I’m saying, if you don’t think I know enough science about it.”\n\nUS Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nWhile there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.\n\nHistorically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.\n\nFor example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller “The Great Bird Flu Hoax,” then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.\n\nIt generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\n\n“[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,” Boyle notes. “It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.”\n\nWhether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, “it doesn’t look very good,” Boyle says.\n\nUnderstanding the COVID-19 Virus\n\nAccording to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. “That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].”\n\nThis is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.\n\nPandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State\n\nPandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\n\n“They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in ‘Biowarfare and Terrorism,’ I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I’m just connecting dots there …\n\nWhat’s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.\n\nThe Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.\n\nAs I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, ‘Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.’\n\nI conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.\n\nAt that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that’s been the case since the first week of November 2001.”\n\nAs noted by Boyle, George Orwell’s book, “1984,” has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\n\n“Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,” Boyle says.\n\n“And again, the proof is I’ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.”\n\nBioweapons Are Developed To Be Used\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What’s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\n\n“There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that’s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 …\n\nJohn Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they’re developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that?\n\nThey go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA …\n\nOnce they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.\n\nSo, they’re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.\n\nJohn Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That’s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.”\n\nIndeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13\n\nHow Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik’s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.\n\nMarik’s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.\n\nAccording to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18\n\nIt also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19\n\nWhile there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.\n\nYou can learn more about Marik’s sepsis protocol in “Vitamin C — A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,” along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.\n\nYou can also review Marik’s PowerPoint presentation, “Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,” presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

        "On June 15, 2022, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised the FDA to grant an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna/NIAID and Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA COVID-19 biologics be given to infants and children under age five and as young as six months old. With that approval, the U.S. became the first country in the world to give COVID vaccine to babies under age two.1\n\nFDA Denies Serious Adverse Reactions to mRNA COVID Shots in Children Under Age Five\n\nOn the same day, VRBPAC released a report listing adverse events reported following mRNA COVID shots in the under age five age group, which included fever; chills; injection site pain; fatigue/excessive sleepiness; irritability/crying; headache and body pain; swollen lymph nodes; vomiting and diarrhea, etc.2 The document stated:\n\nAmong U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports for individuals aged 6 months through 4 years, which may reflect unauthorized use of the vaccine or may reflect a reporting error, the majority (96.3%) were non-serious.3\n\nThe report does state safety concerns identified from post-authorization safety surveillance data in VAERS for other age groups, which includes anaphylaxis, myocarditis and pericarditis, but it does not specifically discuss any of these safety concerns as related to the younger age group of six months to five years old.4 The report states:\n\nReview of passive surveillance adverse event reports and the Sponsor’s periodic safety reports does not indicate new safety concerns. Most adverse events are labeled events and consistent with the safety profile for this vaccine. No unusual frequency, clusters, or other trends for adverse events were identified that would suggest a new safety concern.5\n\nJune 2022 VAERS Data Cited 58 Life Threatening Reactions to mRNA COVID Shots in Children Under Age Three\n\nA June 13, 2022 analysis of VAERS data reported by RT Magazine in Israel showed reports of at least 58 life-threatening adverse events to COVID shots in infants and toddlers under the age of three.6\n\nBefore the analysis was conducted, reports in which a child was exposed to mRNA COVID shots through breast milk were removed from the data pool, as were cases identified as errors in the age registration. Most VAERS reports do not indicate under which circumstances the individual received the vaccine, such as whether they were a participant in a clinical trial or vaccinated for any other reason, including “off-label use.7\n\nChildren between six months and five years of age were not eligible for mRNA COVID shots until June 15, 2022 in the U.S. unless they were part of a clinical trial. However, VAERS has many reports of babies and toddlers who were vaccinated prior to this date. Some reports state that children suffered life-threatening adverse events but it is not always clear what happened to the child following the adverse reaction.8\n\nThe VAERS analysis showed that the most common serious adverse reactions were life-threatening bleeding, anaphylactic shock, anticholinergic syndrome, encephalitis, hypoglycemia and neuroleptic syndrome. In most of the reported cases in VAERS, these were multi-system injuries.9\n\nCase Histories of COVID Shot Reaction Reports in Infants\n\nAuthors of the June 2022 VAERS analysis published in RT Magazine looked at 58 reported cases in children under the age of three, who suffered serious adverse reactions to COVID mRNA shots. Following are summaries of three case histories that include two babies under two months old.10\n\nOne of the most serious adverse reaction reports in VAERS is that of a 43-day old female baby who received Pfizer’s Comirnaty biologic on Jan. 30, 2021. The incident description (VAERS ID 1133837) states:\n\nA 43-days-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9788) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient’s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced circulatory disorder, lightheadedness, asthma exacerbation, dyspnea and respiratory distress on 30 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events not recovered. Senders comment: Asthma / feeling sick, dyspnoea, asthma exacerbation.11\n\nThe report further states that the six-week old baby experienced:\n\nAnaphylactic reaction (broad), Asthma/bronchospasm (narrow), Anticholinergic syndrome (broad), Acute central respiratory depression (broad), Pulmonary hypertension (broad), Cardiomyopathy (broad), Eosinophilic pneumonia (broad), Vestibular disorders (broad), Hypersensitivity (broad), Respiratory failure (narrow), Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (broad).12\n\nPfizer and Moderna clinical trials only included babies over the age of six months. The VAERS report does not state why a 43-day-old baby was given the vaccine, and does not indicate whether the baby recovered or died.13\n\nAnother VAERS report (VAERS ID 976433) states:\n\nA 2-months-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1688) via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (FOSTAIR) for asthma. On 06Jan2021, the patient experienced rash on chest, which was considered serious as medically significant. The patient has not had symptoms associated with COVID-19 and she has not been tested/or has had an inconclusive test for COVID-19. The patient was not enrolled in clinical trial. The patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine. The patient had not recovered from the event. No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.14\n\nAdverse reactions listed on the report were as follows:\n\nAnaphylactic reaction (broad), Hypersensitivity (narrow), Medication errors (narrow), Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (broad).15\n\nSimilar to the previous case, there was no mention of why a two-month-old baby was given the COVID vaccine.16\n\nIn another case (VAERS ID 1012508), the report states:\n\nA 1-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient fit and well, nil previous concerns. The patient developed left postauricular pain (20Jan2021) 4/7 after vaccine, progressed to full left sided bells palsy (20Jan2021).17\n\nThe adverse reactions reported were as follows:\n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome (broad), Noninfectious encephalitis (broad), Noninfectious meningitis (broad), Hearing impairment (broad), Medication errors (narrow).18\n\nReview Vaccine Adverse Event Reports on MedAlerts\n\nVAERS is a publicly accessible database that was part of the safety provisions secured by parents of DPT vaccine injured children in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. It has been used by CDC and independent researchers to publish analyses of vaccine adverse events since 1990.\n\nThe CDC states that, “VAERS accepts reports of adverse events that occur following vaccination. Anyone, including healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to the system. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness… VAERS reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.”\n\nSince 2006, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) has sponsored MedAlerts.org, a user-friendly search engine established in 2003 that allows anyone to access vaccine adverse event reports made to VAERS. The search engine examines vaccines, doses, and demographics, and you can produce tables, graphs, maps and full case reports. MedAlerts includes U.S. and foreign case reports, while other search engines only include U.S. reports. MedAlerts also includes “The Wayback Machine” to include older government data to track any changes in posted data.\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Last week, University of Illinois researchers published a study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the journal Science Advances on menstrual cycle bleeding changes after COVID shots. The study featured a web-based survey of almost 40,000 individuals and found 42 percent of those who were menstruating reported unexpected heavy bleeding after receiving a COVID shot, while 66 percent of postmenopausal individuals reported breakthrough bleeding.1\n\nThe study included respondents aged 18 to 80 who were considered to be “fully” vaccinated. It did not include a representative unvaccinated group for comparison.\n\nHistory of Menstrual Difficulties Associated with More Bleeding After COVID Shots\n\nThe study’s main findings were that a heavier menstrual flow was more likely for those respondents who were of non-white race; were Hispanic/Latinx; were older; had a diagnosed reproductive condition; used hormonal contraception; had been pregnant in the past (whether or not they had given birth); were parous (had given birth), or had experienced fever or fatigue after vaccination. A higher proportion of respondents with reproductive conditions often associated with altered bleeding (endometriosis, painful periods, menorrhagia, fibroids, polycystic ovarian syndrome and adenomyosis) experienced a heavier menstrual flow than those without diagnosed reproductive conditions.\n\nThe combination of a reproductive history that includes having been pregnant but not giving birth in the past was associated with the highest risk of heavier flow after a COVID shot, although having given birth (parity) was also associated with heavier flow. The type of COVID, race, and use of hormonal contraception were not significant factors.2\n\nIn the regularly menstruating group, 43.6 percent reported no change in menstrual flow. However, while 14.3 percent reported a mixture of light or no change, 42.1 percent reported heavier menstrual flow following vaccination.3\n\nNon-Menstruating Respondents Report Breakthrough Bleeding\n\nThe non-menstruating group consisted of those over age 55, who were postmenopausal and had not bled for at least twelve months before vaccination, as well as those who were premenopausal and using long acting (LARC) or continuous hormonal contraceptives and/or gender-affirming hormones that eliminates menstruation. Among those who were postmenopausal and not on any hormonal treatments, breakthrough bleeding was reported by 66 percent of respondents.\n\nAge was a factor in postmenopausal breakthrough bleeding, with those who were younger (mean = 59.8 years) experiencing it more often than those who did not (mean = 61.4 years). Non-Hispanic individuals were also less likely to experience breakthrough bleeding.\n\nJust over 70 percent of non-menstruating respondents using LARC reported breakthrough bleeding, while 38.5 percent of those using gender-affirming hormones reported changes.\n\nUnexplained Menstrual Bleeding May Lead to Diagnostic Tests\n\nIncreased bleeding associated with menstruation is often distressing and may require providers to perform diagnostic procedures to investigate its origins. This is especially true after menstruation has stopped, such as during post menopause, and when breakthrough bleeding occurs, which could be an early sign of cancer.\n\nResponsiveness to external stressors can affect menstruation and is one reason menstrual cycles are seen as reflecting overall health status, or a so-called “vital sign” in clinical practice.4 If potential side effects of a medical treatment like a vaccine are not widely shared with doctors and patients, it can lead to unnecessary, painful, and expensive diagnostic procedures such as uterine biopsy.\n\nStudy authors pointed out that the uterine reproductive system is flexible and adaptable in the face of stressors, which allows it to weather short term challenges in a way that leaves long-term fertility intact. Running a marathon, short-term calorie restriction and psychosocial stressors, for instance, can correspond to menstrual cycle irregularity. An immunological challenge like a vaccination or an illness can cause systemic inflammation in the body that provokes immune mediated responses in organs, including the uterus, and inflammation influences ovarian hormones.5\n\nVaccine Effects on Changes in Menstruation Not Well Studied\n\nMenstruation is seldom considered a variable during vaccine trials, aside from researchers determining the clinical trial participant’s last menstrual period as part of established protections against volunteers being or getting pregnant. The vast majority of research that has been conducted regarding reproductive and menstrual function centers around whether live attenuated vaccines are safe to give to someone who is pregnant or whether vaccination affects fertility. The research that has been conducted on menstrual cycles specifically is often unable to establish a causal link, as the data are obtained through retrospective surveys, data mining and randomized controlled trials, which often do not allow a mechanism for reporting these menstrual changes.6\n\nNew vaccine trial protocols do not typically monitor for acute adverse events for more than seven days, and additional follow-up communications by researchers rarely—if ever—inquire about menstrual cycles or bleeding. Therefore, manufacturers have not systematically investigated the extent to which changes in menstruation is a coincidence or a potential side effect of the vaccine being investigated.\n\nIn media coverage, medical doctors and public health experts often hasten to say that there was “no biological mechanism” or “no data” to support a relationship between vaccine administration and menstrual changes. In other cases, experts declared that these changes were more likely a result of “stress.”7 Dismissal by medical experts of menstrual irregularities after vaccination can fuel even greater public concern.\n\nChanges in Fertility After COVID Shots Difficult to Assess\n\nConcerns about changes in fertility following COVID shots have been difficult to assess because many women, who were enrolled in the pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) clinical trials, were using contraception and, therefore, pregnancy rates were extremely low.8 Pfizer and Moderna advise those who are pregnant when they receive mRNA COVID products, to enroll in a pregnancy registry to help monitor outcomes in women exposed to their products during pregnancy.9 10 Both manufacturer product inserts state that available data on their products “administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.”11 12\n\nPfizer and Moderna report that safety of the mRNA biologics when given to pregnant women was evaluated using toxicity studies in rats injected with the mRNA product twice before mating and twice during gestation. The companies said there were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations and no adverse effects on postnatal development observed in the rats.13 14\n\nBoston University’s Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) may help to evaluate changes in menstrual patterns and fertility after women receive mRNA shots. PRESTO is a prospective cohort study initiated in 2013 that recruits women and their male partners, who are actively trying to conceive but are not yet pregnant. The study evaluates risk factors for delayed conception, miscarriage and adverse birth outcomes, and is the first internet-based fertility study in the United States.15\n\nPRESTO study director and professor of epidemiology Lauren Wise, ScD said, “The prospective design is really helpful, because what we do is we only compare women before and after they received the vaccination. So, it’s not like we’re enrolling people who have already had a vaccination and the menstrual changes into our study. We would only be looking at their data comparing before the vaccination versus after. And so that’s a good way to guard against any bias in the reporting of the menstrual factors or the selection of the participants into the study.”16\n\nGender Bias Still Prevalent in Clinical Trials\n\nThe frightening legacy of Thalidomide, an anti-nausea drug given to pregnant women in the 1950’s caused fetal malformations, as well as fear of harming women’s fertility, made drug makers leery of testing drugs in women and, particularly, in pregnant women. In 1993, the NIH passed the Revitalization Act, requiring researchers they funded to include both women and men in clinical studies, and to analyze their results by sex or gender. While experts say the gaps in science have narrowed, the system is still failing women. (For instance, research on hormonal contraception methods’ mental health effects is scarce, even though some studies suggest a link with depression.)17\n\nThe missing research makes it difficult for women to make confident health decisions, especially around their sexual and reproductive health. As a result, women may risk adverse effects from an approved drug that was untested in women or suffer unnecessarily with health problems that just don’t occur in men. “We’re constantly having to play experiments in our own bodies because nobody tested the drugs on us, so we have to play musical pills with anything we take,” says Sarah Hill, PhD, a professor at Texas Christian University.18\n\nGlobal Studies of Menstruation Changes After COVID Shots Show Similar Results\n\nSeveral other studies on COVID vaccination and menstrual changes have reported results similar to the most recent University of Illinois study. A study of 2269 menstruating women in the North Africa and Middle East region published in March 2022 reported that 66.3 percent reported post-vaccination abnormalities.19\n\nAn Italian study also published in March 2022 included 169 women of childbearing age, who had not experienced cycle irregularities for the past year, did not have gynecological or non-gynecological disease, and who were not receiving hormonal or non-hormonal treatments before they were vaccinated. They reported that 50–60 percent of reproductive age women who received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine had menstrual cycle irregularities, regardless of the type of vaccine administered, with the occurrence of menstrual irregularities slightly higher (60 to 70 percent) after the second dose, which suggested a potential challenge/re-challenge effect. After both the first and second doses of vaccine, the most common changes were longer and heavier menstrual cycles than usual or expected.20\n\nAnother study using data from the fertility tracking app Natural Cycles compared three menstrual cycles pre- and post-vaccine for the vaccinated group and six cycles total for the unvaccinated group. Researchers found a .71-day cycle increase in cycle length following a first dose of mRNA product and a .91-day cycle increase following a second dose. There were no changes in cycle length in the unvaccinated group.21\n\nNIH Awards Grants to Study Effects of COVID Shots on Menstruation\n\nIn August 2021, the NIH awarded one-year supplemental grants totaling $1.67 million to five academic institutions to explore potential links between COVID shots and menstrual changes. Researchers at Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, Michigan State University and Oregon Health and Science University will conduct the research.22\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Opinion | The first reported case of polio in the United States since 2013 was confirmed in New York last week. According to New York health officials, a young adult in Rockland County contracted type 2 “vaccine-derived” poliovirus (VDPV2), which may have been transmitted by someone who received the Sabin live attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV). The unidentified person, who developed paralysis, was temporarily hospitalized and released. 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n“VDPV2, or type 2 poliovirus, is a type of poliovirus derived from the oral polio vaccine which utilizes a live form of the virus. For a short period of time, a newly vaccinated individual may potentially transmit the live virus through stool,” said Hannah Newman, MPH, director of infection prevention at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.7\n\nIn the mid-1990s, co-founders of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to discontinue use of live OPV in the U.S. and replace it with the Salk inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) that cannot cause vaccine strain polio.8\n\nAlthough it is still given to people, in many countries around the world, the OPV has not been used in the U.S. since 2000. The U.S. administers only the IPV.1 3 4 5\n\nBeth Cefalu, the director of strategic communications for Rockland County, said that the polio case in New York is under investigation, but that the infected individual was not believed to have traveled outside the U.S. to a country where type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses are prevalent.1 3\n\nA STAT News article concluded:\n\nIf that is the case, that would indicate someone else inadvertently imported the virus, suggesting there may be additional undetected transmission.1\n\nMost Cases of Paralytic Polio Caused by Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus\n\nIn a 2019 article, The Vaccine Reaction reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) had observed a big increase VDPV2 cases that year in multiple countries that administer the OPV to children. The majority of paralytic polio cases identified in the world were caused by outbreaks of VDPV2 cases in Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia, China, Myanmar, Kenya, Central African Republic (CAR), Angola, Somalia, and Papua New Guinea, Indonesia.8 9\n\nNVIC co-founder and president Barbara Loe Fisher noted:\n\nIn impoverished communities with substandard sanitation and living conditions, vaccine strain poliovirus can contaminate water sources used for bathing and drinking, which can lead to more cases of vaccine strain polio paralysis. Until polio eradication campaigns stop using live oral polio vaccine, the vaccine strain polio virus will continue to cripple children and adults.8\n\nVaccine-Derived Poliovirus Detected in London Sewage\n\nEarlier this year, traces of VDPV2 were found in a sewage plant in London. People who have been vaccinated with OPV can shed the poliovirus in their stools and this can be detected in wastewater. The U.K. Health Security Agency (UHSA) said that the virus was likely brought into the United Kingdom by someone who was recently vaccinated with the OPV.7 10\n\nKimberly Thompson, president of the nonprofit Kid Risk, Inc. in Orlando, Florida, speculates that the poliovirus case in New York may have originated with contaminated sewage, as in the case in London. “With COVID having disrupted immunization [in the U.S.] and travel now having resumed and much more type 2 poliovirus transmission happening, it’s been only a matter of time before we’d have some detection of polioviruses in sewage, as happened recently in the U.K.,” she said.11\n\nPolio Vaccinations Urged by Health Officials\n\nThe New York case apparently involves a person who was not vaccinated for the poliovirus. This has led to calls by state health officials and others for those who have not had the polio vaccine to move quickly to get the shot.\n\n“Based on what we know about this case, and polio in general, the Department of Health strongly recommends that unvaccinated individuals get vaccinated or boosted with the FDA-approved IPV polio vaccine as soon as possible,” said Mary Bassett, MD, MPH, health commissioner for the state of New York.1 3 5\n\n“This isn’t normal. We don’t want to see this,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, DrPH, a professor of epidemiology and pandemic researcher at Brown University. “If you’re vaccinated, it’s not something you need to worry about. But if you haven’t gotten your kids vaccinated, it’s really important that you make sure they’re up to date.”6\n\n“We want shots in the arms of those who need it,” said Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, DO, MPH, health commissioner for Rockland County.5\n\nOne case of vaccine-derived polio and they’re already calling for shots for a virus believed to have been eradicated in the U.S. since 1979. Are declared victories over disease-causing pathogens that tenuous?\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Pediatrician Paul Halczenko, MD awaits a decision in an appeal he filed against Ascension Health, his employer for the last ten years. Dr. Halczenko and four other health care workers, were put on leave from their job at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital after refusing to be vaccinated for COVID-19 for religious reasons when it was mandated as a condition of employment for 14,700 employees in Indiana.1 2\n\nDr. Halczenko is one of only three pediatric intensive care unit doctors in Indiana. He and four other health care workers sued Ascension and St. Vincent Hospital for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act “by systematically and callously failing to accommodate their religious beliefs and denying their requests for exemption without giving individualized consideration of, or individualized responses to, each request.”3\n\nDoctor Alleges Religious Discrimination\n\nThe four other health care workers who filed suit along with the doctor were allowed to return to work when Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate in December 2021. However, Dr. Halczenko, who works in critical care for pediatric patients, was told that he was not allowed to return to work.4 William Bock III, attorney for the doctor, points out that no reason was given as to why the doctor was singled out and prevented from returning to work along with the other previously suspended workers. He said:\n\nWe have no explanation for why Dr. Halczenko is treated differently. We believe that it’s religious discrimination.5\n\nDr. Halczenko argued that, should he not be granted a preliminary injunction and be allowed to return to work, his skills as a highly specialized pediatric intensive care doctor as well as his reputation would suffer irreparable harm. However, Judge James Patrick Hanlon denied the doctor’s request for a temporary injunction stating that he found that the doctor, “has failed to make a ‘substantial showing’ of irreparable injury” that would necessitate him being reinstated in his position by way of a temporary injunction.6\n\nThe court stated that, should he prevail on the Title VII claims, Dr. Halczenko could ultimately be made whole without the court issuing a preliminary injunction.7\n\nAt the same time, the court noted that Ascension provided almost no supporting evidence as to the reason why the doctor’s religious exemption was denied, but concluded that the defendant’s motivation behind the denial of the accommodation is not a matter to be resolved at a preliminary injunction hearing.\n\nDoctor Argues the COVID Vaccine Does Not Prevent Transmission of Infection\n\nThe judge, failing to find that the doctor’s reputation would suffer an irreparable injury as a result of being put on administrative leave due to his religious beliefs, wrote:\n\nAnd, here the claimed reputational injury—and corresponding impediment to finding a comparable job—would arise from the undisputed, truthful fact that Dr. Halczenko’s employment was terminated because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19”8\n\nDr. Halczenko defended his position, saying:\n\nWell, first I would say I am following the science. The preponderance of the evidence suggests and even as we know no —not necessarily at the time of the lawsuit, but certainly in the intervening weeks and months—that vaccination does not actually prevent transmission. So, the best protection that I can offer to my patients is to use the personal protective equipment and the other measures that are employed by health care workers across the world and have been demonstrated to be effective.9\n\nAscension responded to these allegations…\n\nIt is in the public’s interest to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of serious illness to St. Vincent’s patients, employees, and visitors. This public interest in reducing the risk of transmission among patients and employees outweighs any interest asserted by Halczenko.10\n\nThis matter was heard before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 31 and a decision is pending.11\n\nAscension Health Faces More Lawsuits Due to Its COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate\n\nA group of 64 health care workers are also suing Ascension Health and St. Vincent Hospital in a class action lawsuits for having been suspended without pay after they refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The employees objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and filed religious exemption to the vaccine mandate. The employees argue that Ascension failed to properly assess each individual religious exemption application.[12]\n\nThe lawsuit alleges:\n\nAscension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will.13\n\nThe employees were suspended without pay beginning Nov. 12, 2021 and told that, if they failed to get the vaccine by Jan. 4, 2022, they would be fired. In December, Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate and allowed the employees who filed a religious exemption to return to work.\n\nThe employees are requesting that Ascension be found guilty of violating federal discrimination laws and be ordered to pay them for the time they were suspended, as well as other compensation.14\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Opinion | America’s Frontline Doctors’ founder Simone Gold was sentenced to serve 60 days in prison and ordered to pay a $9,500 fine for her involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 event. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, DC also sentenced Dr. Simone Gold to 12 months of supervised release after her 60-day prison term is served.\n\nThe following is a statement released by America’s Frontline Doctors prior to the sentencing on June 16, 2022.\n\nSix months after America’s Frontline Doctors’ viral video of their press conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court on July 27, 2020, Founder Dr. Simone Gold traveled to a free speech rally in Washington, DC, to speak on January 6, 2021.\n\nIn the months between the press conference and January 6th, Dr. Gold was asked to present publicly on numerous occasions about physicians’ free speech and her experience of being fired for prescribing early treatment to COVID-19 patients.\n\nBy this time, she had also founded America’s Frontline Doctors, a division of the Free Speech Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. Dr. Gold was scheduled to speak on January 6th alongside numerous other presenters after President Trump’s appearance at the rally, which had a government approved permit.\n\nAt her expected start time, Dr. Gold was then told all speeches were suddenly canceled without explanation. Upon hearing this, Dr. Gold was amongst thousands swept into the Capitol building when the doors were opened from the inside, with law enforcement officers ushering people in. While there, Dr. Gold realized it was the only remaining moment to deliver her message to those who came to hear it, and so she gave her remarks there.\n\nWhen an officer instructed her to move towards an exit, she complied, and shortly after when asked to leave the building entirely, she did so. The media coverage after January 6th showed carefully selected edits of violent scenes, but that was not Dr. Gold’s observation of the day.\n\nSubsequently, Dr. Gold was arrested and prosecuted along with hundreds of other non-violent citizens for being present at the Capitol. Dr. Gold reached a plea agreement for entering a restricted building. Her sentencing is scheduled today, June 16, 2022.\n\nDr. Gold did express regret for being involved in a situation that later became unpredictable, but what she is facing are the consequences of exercising free speech in today’s America. Like most January 6th defendants, she is a victim of selective prosecution—a defining feature of corrupted governments, and a direct violation of the equal protection guarantee of the US Constitution.\n\nFor example, consider that there were hundreds of arrests for violent protests in association with President Trump’s Inauguration in 2017. The government subsequently dropped all of those charges, including charges against people who were actually disrupting Congress from inside the Congressional gallery while Congress was in session. But with the January 6th arrests, the government has not only failed to drop any charges against nonviolent persons in public spaces, such as Dr. Gold, it has instead aggressively violated defendants’ civil rights at nearly every turn.\n\nThere are innumerable well-documented instances of January 6th defendants not receiving due process noted in the book January 6 authored by Julie Kelly. For instance, some defendants have been held in prison for nearly 18 months pretrial.\n\nIn Dr. Gold’s case, she peacefully gave a speech on medical freedom and Constitutional rights in the public Rotunda. This resulted in the government violently arresting her in a surprise raid, breaking the front door of her home, using over a dozen FBI and law enforcement officers with assault weapons pointed at her from two feet away. The intent to terrorize her with this tactical assault suited to a raid on a violent drug cartel was unmistakable; she suffers from PTSD to this day.\n\nDr. Gold’s peaceful exercise of her 1st Amendment rights also resulted in numerous restrictions of her personal civil liberties and severe interference with her ability to serve the millions who look to America’s Frontline Doctors for life- saving information and civil rights support. This continued for over a year before any adjudication.\n\nSuch inequitable treatment based upon political preference shows the collapse of the rule of law. For people interested in learning the truth about the January 6th event, please watch Capitol Punishment. In addition, the government has aggressively refrained from arresting or prosecuting certain highly visible individuals seen on videotape who waived people into the building.\n\nThe government has aggressively withheld 14,000 hours of closed-circuit security footage. The government has not disclosed how many FBI agents and assets were in the crowd. And the media lied when it stated five officers were killed—exactly zero officers were killed that day. The only person who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, a petite unarmed 35-year-old female military veteran posing no lethal danger, was gunned down by Michael Byrd, a Capitol police officer, who in a prior incident of severe negligence left a loaded gun with no safety in a public restroom. Byrd was never charged for Babbitt’s murder.\n\nDr. Gold remains committed to her advocacy for physicians’ free speech. In quoting George Washington, she said: “If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.” For over two years now, We The People have been under attack. Our Constitutional rights have been increasingly trampled and eroded. The First Amendment has been annihilated. This is unprecedented in our lifetimes.\n\nA concerted effort has been undertaken to “cancel” physicians who do not follow the mainstream narrative. Dr. Gold has been targeted by these attacks since the White Coat Summit in July 2020 when she shared the news of lifesaving medications alongside many esteemed colleagues, now numbering in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe California Medical Board subsequently threatened Dr. Gold’s license with an unfounded claim she was sharing “dangerous disinformation.” Meanwhile, data continues to grow in overwhelming support of her positions with every passing week.\n\nThe attempted silencing of this one doctor was just a preamble for what is to come throughout the nation. California AB 2098, an official government censorship bill, has just been passed through the CA State Assembly. This outrageous bill puts a gag order on doctors in exchange for a California medical license. Without a license, a doctor cannot practice medicine. When a doctor has a license revoked in any state, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for that doctor to obtain a license in another state. This is career-ending. Further, AB 2098 proposes to violate the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship and create a new category of “unprofessional conduct” against doctors who provide education and early treatment for COVID-19. AFLDS has prepared a comprehensive Issue Brief on AB 2098.\n\nIssue Brief – CA AB 2098 | America’s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS.org\n\nAs we consider the results of Dr. Gold’s sentencing, one thing is clear. We are still far from the change that is needed. The Constitution is crumbling before us, and we must continue to stand for what is right. We will never cower to government threats and harassment. Dr. Gold risked her career when she stood against the mainstream narrative to save lives. Now, she still stands, risking her freedom, to choose what is right over what is comfortable. We must learn to be so bold and continue to stand together against the growing tyranny we face.\n\nThis article was reprinted with the author’s permission.

        "A student at Union College was unenrolled and forced to leave the campus in upstate New York after she refused to take a COVID-19 booster shot. The pre-med biology and Spanish language student suffered severe adverse reactions after receiving the first series of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID shots in the fall.1\n\nSophomore Ellie Puentes is a first-generation student who attended Union College on academic scholarship. Puentes received the first set of COVID vaccines when the college required the shots in order to attend school. Immediately afterwards, Puentes suffered from sharp adnominal pain landing her in a hospital emergency room for hours. She still suffers from constant nausea, vomiting, chest pains and shortness of breath.2\n\nPuentes said:\n\nJust the other day I wake up randomly just puking and I don’t know what the cause of that is, and then on top of that, I have shortness of breath. I can’t work out like I used to. I’m getting chest pains where this never happened prior to the vaccine. And I don’t know what’s going on! “The puking happens more often than I would say the diarrhea and the shortness of breath. … I get these sharp pains in my chest and even my immune system, I believe, has just gone down. I’ve been more sick than I’ve ever been.3\n\nCollege Rejects Medical Exemption to COVID Booster\n\nWhen the college recently announced that boosters would be mandatory, Puentes e-mailed the school explaining her situation and the severe adverse reactions she had to the first series of COVID shots and asked to speak to the administrative staff in person about this issue. That request was denied, and Puentes was expelled from school and ordered to leave campus via e-mail. [4] The school refused a letter from Puentes long-time doctor who stated the COVID vaccine booster shot was “ill-advised”5 as well as the paperwork she received from the hospital after her visit post COVID vaccination.6\n\nThe letter Puentes’ doctor sent to the college read in part…\n\nMs. Puentes is a 20-year-old who has had severe, prolonged symptoms since receiving her COVID vaccines…She missed one week of school after the shot…it is my opinion that Ms. Puentes be granted an exception from receiving the booster COVID vaccine. She currently is in an unfavorable state of health, presumably caused by the vaccine itself and getting the vaccine is ill advised.7\n\nDespite Union College purportedly allowing exemptions to vaccination for approved medical and religious reasons, the doctor’s letter was ignored by college officials.8\n\nBoth Puentes’ doctor and the doctors in the emergency room diagnosed her with gastritis. However, Union College denied that gastritis could be an adverse reaction to the shot. The school nurse told her to just get Moderna’s Spikevax COVID biologic this time, which uses the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty COVID biologic, if she was concerned about the reactions she had to Comirnaty.9\n\nPfizer/BioNTech Confirms Reaction Was Likely from COVID Shot\n\nUndeterred, Puentes reached out to Pfizer to inquire whether her severe symptoms could be due to the vaccines she was forced to get to attend college. Puentes said Pfizer confirmed her fears stating, “They confirmed that the symptoms I’m having could be or are related to the vaccine because they have seen others with the same reactions.”10\n\nUnion College officials discounted the vaccine manufacturer’s confirmation that other people were diagnosed with gastritis like Puentes and that her symptoms were likely from the Comirnaty vaccine. Puentes was denied a medical exemption to the COVID vaccine requirement and she was expelled from school.11\n\nThe school’s actions are not supported by government policy as the federal health officials consider individuals, who have received the initial two dose series of COVID shots, to be fully vaccinated and they have not changed the definition of “fully vaccinated” to include booster doses. However, despite the federal government stance, Union College is not alone in demanding receipt of COVID booster doses. A number of private businesses and schools are mandating the COVID booster shot as proof a person is “fully vaccinated.” New York University, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan and Northwestern are among the other universities that require a COVID booster for attendance.12 13\n\nPuentes’ friends started a GoFundMe account to help her pay for the remaining weeks she had on campus and to raise money for a lawyer.14 GoFundMe, an online fund raising platform, shut Puentes’ account down silencing her friends’ efforts to help the young college student.15>\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "The cell phones of tens of millions of Americans were tracked by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials, who used location data to ensure compliance with COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccination campaigns according to Vice, which was able to obtain internal documents through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).1\n\nThe CDC used the cell phone data to determine whether lockdown quarantine curfews and travel restrictions were complied with, to track people entering K-12 public schools, and to monitor the effectiveness of COVID response policies, particularly within the Navajo Nation.2\n\nThe cell phone data was given to the CDC by the databroker, SafeGraph, at first for no cost. Starting in 2021, the CDC paid the company $420,000 to continue to receive cell phone data. SafeGraph is backed by billionaire and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel3 and ex-Saudi intelligence chief Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, among other investors.4\n\nCDC’s Cell Phone Tracking Raises Privacy Concerns\n\nSafegraph defends its action by claiming that the data they sold to the CDC is representative of large groups of people rather than individual people, which prevents any issues with user privacy. However, after privacy concerns were raised, Google banned all of its app developers from working with SafeGraph last year.5\n\nThe location data provided to the CDC was aggregated location data designed to show movement trends among a group of people such as where they live, work and where they go. However, there is concern that the data can be used to track a specific person by deanonymizing the data.6 Supporting the concern that aggregate data could be used to track individuals, SafeGuard has said that they will no longer sell location data belonging to people who went to health clinics that provide abortion services.7\n\nCDC’S Cell Phone Tracking Data Also Used for Non-COVID Purposes\n\nUsing the COVID pandemic as the primary reason for purchasing the data on an urgent, emergency-use basis, the CDC conceded that the data was intended to be used for other non-pandemic response purposes, as well.\n\nThe CDC said:\n\nCDC also plans to use mobility data and services acquired through this acquisition to support non-COVID-19 programmatic areas and public health priorities across the agency, including but not limited to travel to parks and green spaces, physical activity and mode of travel, and population migration before, during, and after natural disasters. The mobility data obtained under this contract will be available for CDC agency-wide use and will support numerous CDC priorities.8\n\nCyber security researcher Zach Edwards said:\n\nThe CDC seems to have purposefully created an open-ended list of use cases, which included monitoring curfews, neighbor-to-neighbor visits, visits to churches, schools and pharmacies, and also a variety of analysis with this data specifically focused on ‘violence.’… In my opinion the SafeGraph data is way beyond any safe thresholds [around anonymity].9\n\nInternal documents obtained under FOIA revealed the CDC has at least 21 intended uses for the cellular data pertaining to COVID related matters, such as “implementation and cancelation of community mitigation measures and its impact on case and fatality rates;” analysis of bar and restaurant closing as compared to COVID cases and deaths; detecting hot spot locations; monitoring quarantine compliance; monitoring COVID and influenza vaccination rates and mask compliance; monitoring “points of interest,” such as pharmacies or vaccine distribution centers. However, the CDC apparently also wants to track cell phones for non-COVID uses, such as “research points of interest for physical activity and chronic disease prevention visits to parks, gyms or weight management businesses,” and exposure to violence in urban areas, among other uses.10\n\nThe CDC also bought cellular data from a Cubeiq on an emergency basis, reportedly because of COVID, but documents showed the federal health agency planned on using the data for non-COVID related purposes, as well.11\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Officials in some cities in China have ordered all indoor pets belonging to SARS-CoV-2 patients to be killed due to fear that the animals could transmit the virus to other humans.1\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly originated in a wet food market or biohazard lab in Wuhan, China in late 2019, government officials in China have been implementing a zero-transmission policy in an attempt to eradicate the virus. Chinese public health officials believe the zero-COVID policy will stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but,2 despite taking more and more extreme measures to prevent transmission of the virus.3 4\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials have stated that the risk of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2 to human beings is low but that the virus can spread from people to animals during close contact.5\n\nPublic Health Officials Tell Anci District to Kill Pets of SARS-CoV-2 Patients\n\nOn the morning of Mar. 30, 2022, Anci District Prevention and Control Office issued a notice stating:\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of positive patients returning home, after communicating with the Langfang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is necessary to comprehensively and thoroughly kill the animals domesticated by positive patients as soon as possible.6\n\nThe Office of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Anci District, which is responsible for designating professional culling teams, confirmed that it had received the notice from public health officials at the Anci District Prevention and Control Office.7\n\nBy 5:00 pm on Mar. 30, 2022, reportedly the “order” had been halted due to public outrage. It is not known how many pets had been killed before the order was suspended.8\n\nPets Reportedly Killed While Owners Were in Quarantine\n\nA Chinese woman who identified herself as Ms. Fu said that she was asked to quarantine in the city of Shangrao after government contact tracers said she had been in close contact with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She tested negative for the virus.9 She was not able to quarantine with her dog. However, community workers assured her the corgi would be taken care of in her home while she was away.\n\nHome security camera showed community workers taking Ms. Fu’s dog away, after which he was killed. The video went viral on China’s social media platform known as Weibo, causing public outrage.10\n\nAnother woman from the city of Harbin said that her three cats were killed in September 2021 while she was in quarantine. It has been also reported that authorities in cities of Chengdu and Wuxi have entered homes of people that are in quarantine and killed their pets.11\n\nDuring the course of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in China have killed pets on several occasions, resulting in conflicts between local governments and citizens.12\n\nMetal Barriers Go Up in Shanghai Apartment Complexes\n\nAssociated Press reported on Apr. 24 that Chinese officials were erecting metal barrier fences in neighborhoods around buildings and apartment complexes in Shanghai, where they believe people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apparently, public health officials have identified more than 21,000 new COVID-19 cases with most of the cases being asymptomatic and driven by the omicron variant circulating in Shanghai.13\n\nAccording to the AP story, many residents in the city have had trouble getting groceries and access to medical care because of the barriers and strict controls on movement. A video circulated on the internet earlier in April heard Chinese people subjected to draconian lockdown measures screaming from their apartments “Send us food! Send us food!”14\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a change of heart from its Apr. 7, 2022 decision, agreed to hear arguments against the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for federal workers. The court will hear the matter en banc which means that there will be a full panel of judges convened. This decision vacates the court’s previous ruling which reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers. Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers has once again been paused.1 2 3\n\nImplementation of the COVID vaccine mandate will be delayed until at least September when the full court will hear arguments. The Biden administration has announced that they will not process or make any decisions regarding medical or religious exemptions to the mandate or suspend or fire any workers for failing to comply with President Biden’s mandate pending the court’s decision.4\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previous decision reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers based on the court’s conclusion that the president of the United States has the power to order to federal employees to get vaccinated, while federal judges do not have jurisdiction to interfere. Because the court found that they did not have authority to override the president in matters like this, the judges did not rule on the merits of the case. In September, the same court en banc may be more likely to consider all arguments and make a decision on the merits of the case.5\n\nHistory of the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for Federal Workers\n\nIn September 2021, the Biden administration ordered that all federal workers receive a COVID vaccination as a condition of employment. In January 2022, however, a Federal District Court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against the mandate, which halted the vaccine requirement for federal workers. The court blocked the mandate, finding that it exceeded the President’s authority and required Congressional approval.6 The judges ruled:\n\n… no legal remedy adequately protects the liberty interests of employees who must choose between violating a mandate of doubtful validity or consenting to an unwanted medical procedure that cannot be undone.7\n\nThe Biden administration appealed the decision. In February, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas District Court’s temporary injunction pending the outcome of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals final ruling.8\n\nOn Apr. 7, however, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Biden administration and held that the federal vaccine mandate must be reinstated, and the case dismissed. The court held that a federal judge does not have jurisdiction over federal employees challenging the vaccine mandate and redress is found exclusively under Civil Service Law.9 The court said that the President, as CEO of the executive branch, has proper authority to issue a mandate on federal employees.10\n\nAdvocacy Group Feds for Medical Freedom Presses On\n\nThe ruling reinstating the mandate effective May 23, faced a challenge when an advocacy group called Feds for Medical Freedom and other interested parties filed a petition seeking to overturn the decision and requested that the full 17-member court hear new arguments in the matter.11\n\nFeds for Medical Freedom, which has over 6,000 members, argues that the President’s unilateral decision to affect the lives of millions of federal employees is, “a matter of exceptional importance,” which necessitates a hearing en banc. The group also contends that the Fifth Circuit’s April opinion contradicts previous court precedent with regard to pre-enforcement challenges.12\n\nMarcus Thronton, president of Feds for Medical Freedom, pointed out the high stakes of this case stating:\n\nA policy that threatens to derail or end the careers of dedicated public servants who do not consent to take a COVID vaccine is both unconstitutional and immoral.13\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "On July 4, 2022, Canadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Canadians may be required to get a COVID-19 booster shot every nine months to protect themselves against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Duclos said, “The virus evolves and Omicron made us aware we will never be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We have to maintain our vaccinations up to date.”1\n\nCurrently in Canada, “fully vaccinated” is defined by Health Canada as having two doses of any of the public health agency’s approved COVID vaccine.2\n\n“Fully Vaccinated” Makes No Sense Anymore Says Canadian Health Minister\n\nMinister Duclos’ message may be directed to people who have not received their first booster.3 Government officials in Canada have said that, as of June 19, 2022, almost 81 percent of the total population has received the first two COVID shots but only 49 percent of the population has received a booster shot.4\n\nColin Furness, PhD, an epidemiologist from the University of Toronto and Nazeem Muhajarine, PhD, an epidemiologist from University of Saskatchewan, said that uptake for the third dose of a COVID shot has been slow in comparison to that of the first and second doses due to the fact that the vaccine was initially presented to the public as being comprised of two doses, giving people the idea that was all they needed to do to prevent having a serious case of COVID disease.5\n\nDr. Furness said:\n\nThat’s the mental model that most people had. So when we started to say you kind of need a third dose now … [they] said, ‘You sold us an idea that there was a two-dose vaccine and I signed on, now you’re changing the deal and I don’t like that, I’m walking away.’6\n\nWhen asked if the COVID vaccine mandate would return in the fall of 2022, Minister Duclos responded:\n\nWe must continue to fight against COVID. We want to be prepared for next fall, and that requires an up-to-date vaccination, which is based on the nine months.7\n\nMinister Duclos also made it clear that no one is “fully vaccinated” anymore. He said:\n\nNine months is very clear and will help people understand why ‘up-to-date’ is the right way to think about vaccination now. Fully vaccinated’ makes no sense now. It’s about ‘up-to-date.’ So am I up-to-date in my vaccination? Have I received a vaccination in the last nine months?” He added that, “Up-to-date’ means you have received your last dose in the past nine months. If you’ve already received a first booster, that’s great. Please see if you’re eligible for a second or third booster to remain up-to-date.8\n\nMajority of Canadians Willing to Get a COVID Booster\n\nAccording to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) conducted in the fall of 2021, 86 percent of Canadians aged 12 and older reported that they were “very” or “somewhat likely” to get a COVID booster shot.9\n\nThe survey showed differences across different populations with respect to willingness to receive a COVID booster dose. From September to mid-November 2021, women were slightly more likely than men to report being willing to get a booster dose (87 percent versus 85 percent). Among youth aged 12 to 17.84 percent reported a willingness to get a booster, which was similar to adults aged 18 to 49 (83 percent). Older Canadians aged 50 and older reported higher booster dose willingness (89 percent) compared with the younger age groups.10\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Jacob Puliyel, MD, a pediatrician in India for more than 40 years, brought suit in the Supreme Court of India against the Union of India and COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in a legal challenge to the country’s COVID vaccine program.1 Dr. Puliyel, who has served as Director of Research and Projects at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi and is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) on immunizations in India, sued the government and COVID vaccine manufacturers seeking release of information related to the COVID vaccine approval process, as well as arguing for a policy change that allows unvaccinated persons to enter public spaces and access resources.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Puliyel asked the Supreme Court of India for the release of each phase of clinical trial data for the COVID vaccines administered in India; disclosure of minutes from the meeting of the Subject Expert Committee and the NTGAI with regard to vaccines; release of information surrounding the approval or rejection of emergency use applications of vaccines by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and disclosure of post vaccination data related to COVID. He also asked the court to declare that all COVID vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and a violation of h2citizen’s rights.\n\nDr. Puliyel: COVID Vaccines Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission\n\nIn support of his request, Dr. Puliyel submitted affidavits to the court stating that natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 is superior to vaccine acquired immunity and that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID. News articles were submitted to show that two-thirds of the population in India had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have antibodies to the virus, and that the vaccinated were susceptible to breakthrough infections. Dr. Puliyel also argued that vaccine mandates and restrictions on the unvaccinated are meaningless because the virus is transmitted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.\n\nThe government maintained that the COVID vaccines administered in India, Covaxin and Covishield, are needed to combat the global pandemic threat. They also maintained that trial data cannot be released to the public due to privacy concerns; that information regarding adverse events has already been released; that vaccination remains voluntary for all citizens, and that restrictions on the unvaccinated were necessary to protect the public health.\n\nRespondent COVID vaccine manufacturers argued that they followed strict guidelines for government approval of their COVID vaccines.\n\nThe Union of India strongly opposed this lawsuit, claiming that the publicity could increase vaccine hesitancy and endanger the public health, and that public health matters should not be interfered with by the court. However, because Dr. Puliyel brought this lawsuit in the interest of the public and because he is considered a subject matter expert, the Court determined the case would be heard for the welfare of the public.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India Looked to High Courts in Other Countries\n\nThe government made their argument relying on prominent cases in India, as well as U.S. cases, such as Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Zucht v. King; Biden vs. Missouri, and Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo. The court also looked to New South Wales for guidance, finding that the Supreme Court in Assam v. Hazzard held that it was not the court’s role to determine the effectiveness of the government’s regulations or whether the regulations were the best response to the risks COVID posed to the public, instead the New South Whales Supreme Court emphasized that their only role was to determine the legal validity of the Minister’s orders.\n\nReviewing India’s case history, the Court summarized its role in reviewing policy decisions:\n\nto check whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary” but not to, “substitute their own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper. 2 In Distribution of Essential Supplies & Services during Pandemic, the Court determined that it would not, “second guess” the policy experts, but would “exercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons.”3\n\nCourt Found Forced Vaccination Violates the Constitution of India\n\nIn considering the global pandemic, the court said that it could not find fault with the government’s vaccination drive, citing the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2; the approximate loss of 5,23,843 lives from the virus in India; and the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), TAG-CO-VAC and SAGE that vaccination would provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death.\n\nHowever, regarding the issue of the right of individual privacy verses the government restricting individual rights in the name of public health, the Supreme Court of India found that forced vaccination is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court previously found in Article 21 a right to personal autonomy, which extends to the right to refuse medical treatment.\n\nIn balancing the state’s interest in public health and an individual’s right to personal autonomy, the court found that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution grants individuals the right to determine how they should live their own life, which includes the right to refuse medical treatment such as vaccination. However, when there is a likelihood that an individual could spread the virus to other people, the state’s interest in protecting the public allows the government to impose certain restrictions on individual rights, as long as such restrictions are reasonable, in proportion to the objective sought, and reviewable by the courts. Accordingly, the Court found that the government’s restrictions are a valid exercise of power, despite evidence that an unvaccinated person is no more likely to spread the Delta or Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus than a vaccinated person.\n\nThe Court: COVID Vaccination Policy in India Not Unreasonable\n\nIn support of his case, Dr. Puliyel presented scientific journals showing that patients who recovered from COVID still had antibodies 11 months after infection. He also pointed out that countries with a higher percent of the population vaccinated have a higher rate of COVID per one million people. He said that a vaccine surveillance report in the United Kingdom showed that, in week 40, there was a negative efficacy of the vaccine in those over the age of 30.\n\nThe court confirmed that its only role is to determine whether the Union of India took into consideration scientific research when establishing its policy advocating COVID vaccination for the entire country. The court acknowledged that large portions of the public cannot be considered healthy because they suffer from chronic disease and lack of nutrition, especially the elderly population, and that the Union of India’s vaccination policy was rightly centered around large segments of more vulnerable people, rather than a minority who are healthy as the subjects in the scientific articles that Dr. Puliyel presented to support the efficacy of natural immunity. Accordingly, the court found that the COVID vaccination policy of India was made in the interest of public health and is not unreasonable.\n\nThe Court: Vaccinated Population a Source of Virus Transmission\n\nConsidering the fact that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated pose nearly the same risk of transmitting the virus, the court looked at whether the Union of India’s vaccination policy of restricting unvaccinated persons from accessing public resources amounted to discrimination. Dr. Puliyel presented a letter published in the Lancet finding that peak viral load of COVID did not differ either by vaccination status or by variant; that the secondary infection rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated households only differed by two percent, and that four of the five most vaccinated countries were categorized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high transmission countries. In addition, he submitted a study conducted in Massachusetts in July 2021 demonstrating that, after attending public gatherings, 346 out of 469 COVID cases (74 percent) were among vaccinated persons.\n\nPresented with this data, the court concluded:\n\nIt appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.4 The court admitted that vaccine mandates may have been found to be constitutional prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that do not appear to respond to COVID vaccines. However, now that vaccinated persons present nearly the same risk of transmission as unvaccinated persons, the court said that restrictions placed on the unvaccinated are not in proportion to the risk they pose to public health.4\n\nThe court wrote:\n\nWhile there is abundant data to show that getting vaccinated continues to be the dominant expert advice even in the face of new variants, no submission nor any data has been put forth to justify restrictions only on unvaccinated individuals when emerging scientific evidence appears to indicate that the risk of transmission of the virus from unvaccinated individuals is almost on par with that from vaccinated persons. To put it differently, neither the Union of India nor the State Governments have produced any material before this court to justify the discriminatory treatment of unvaccinated individuals in public places by imposition of vaccine mandates”5\n\nThe court suggested that all authorities, public, private and educational, review their current orders that restrict an unvaccinated person’s access to public services and resources.\n\nThe Court: Government Followed Approval Process for COVID Vaccines\n\nDr. Puliyel asserted that the government rushed the approval of COVID vaccines in, “a hurried and opaque manner.”6 He said that the trial data, regulatory approvals, and minutes from meetings approving the vaccine have not been publicly disclosed, which demonstrates a lack of transparency in the approval process, and that, while the complete data sets may not be available yet, releasing preliminary COVID vaccine adverse event data would allow individuals to make an informed vaccination decision.\n\nThe court disagreed, finding that the government’s approval for emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccines was properly made in accordance with the statutory regime in place. In India, all new drug trials must follow a certain protocol with stringent statutory requirements as set forth in the Good Clinical Practices guidelines and be approved by the Ethics Committee and the Central Licensing Authority. The Ethics Committee, which is comprised of medical, scientific and non-medical and nonscientific members, is an independent review board that is tasked with providing an objective and independent review of the clinical trials.\n\nThe Union of India claimed that these strict clinical trial guidelines were followed for COVID vaccine clinical trials and that the main findings of trials have been published in a peer reviewed journal, in accordance with WHO requirements.\n\nThe Court: Ongoing COVID Vaccine Trial Data Must Be Publicly Available\n\nThe court agreed with the government and declined to mandate the disclosure of segregated clinical trial data, citing privacy reasons, and also declined to declare that COVID vaccine approvals were granted without proper review of clinical trial data. However, the court ordered that relevant data, which must be published under statutory regimes and WHO requirements for ongoing clinical trials, along with data from COVID vaccine post-marketing trials, be made available to the public without delay.\n\nDr. Puliyel advised the court that, because clinical trials are made up of a small subset of the population, not all adverse events may be seen during trials and, instead, may only be noticed once the vaccine is available to the public at large. He pointed out that, in 2018, the WHO changed the way it classified adverse events after vaccination to only consider adverse events as vaccine related when that same adverse reaction also occurred during previous smaller, limited clinical trials.\n\nIn other words:\n\nReactions observed during post-marketing surveillance are not considered as ‘consistent with causal association with vaccine’, if a significant increase in such reactions during Phase III trials had not been recorded.7\n\nIn the case of the COVID vaccine trials, phase III trials were cut short and then control subjects were offered the vaccine, which had the effect of diluting the control group and ultimately making it impossible to evaluate potential differences in long term health outcomes between the vaccinated and control groups. At the same time, it makes it more possible for doctors to dismiss adverse events that occur post COVID vaccination, as adverse events are less likely to be considered vaccine related events. Therefore, Dr. Puliyel asked that all post marketing adverse event data be made available to the public.\n\nHowever, the court declined to act, finding that the Phase III trials were cut short on the advice of the SEC, and stating that the government has protocols in place to consider and investigate adverse reactions to COVID vaccine, which only occur during the post-marketing phase.\n\nDr. Puliyel: India’s Adverse Event Reporting System Should Be More Like VAERS\n\nDr. Puliyel contended that the vaccine adverse events reporting system in India is not transparent and complete data as on serious adverse events should be published like in the United States though the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The court pointed out that the National AEFI Surveillance Secretariat, which has been in place for a decade, has a protocol in place for identifying and monitoring adverse events to vaccination.\n\nHowever, Dr. Puliyel argued that the vaccine adverse event reporting system in India needs to be changed to allow individuals, as well as private doctors, to report adverse events like is done in the U.S. with VAERS. The court agreed and directed the Union of India to facilitate the reporting of vaccine adverse events by individuals, as well as private doctors, on a public on-line platform. The court said:\n\nInformation relating to adverse effects following immunisation is crucial for the purpose of understanding the safety of the vaccines that are being administered, apart from being instrumental in further scientific studies around the pandemic. There is an imminent need for collection of requisite data of adverse events and wider participation of people in reporting the adverse events is necessary for the purpose of gathering correct information.8\n\nThe Court: Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination Program Will Stand\n\nDr. Puliyel presented evidence that children are not at high risk of severe illness from COVID and argued that the risk from COVID vaccination outweighs the risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, pointing out that a large number of children in India have already recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe court sided with the government, stating that it would not second-guess expert opinion as to the safety of pediatric COVID vaccinations. However, the court ordered the Union of India to immediately release the key findings and clinical trial results of Corbevax, the COVID vaccine that does not use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is being given to children, if that data has not already been released.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India acknowledged that citizens have a liberty interest that prohibits forced vaccination; that restrictions placed on unvaccinated persons should be reviewed in light of the fact that the COVID vaccine does not prevent infection and transmission; that ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trial data should be publicly released, and that the government’s vaccine adverse event reporting system should be improved. However, the court did not fully recognize and adequately respond to all of Dr. Puliyel’s legitimate complaints about the government’s COVID vaccination program.\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Opinion | It is interesting to observe the mainstream media’s reporting of the recent news that Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For example, the headline of an article by CNBC reads, “Texas Gov. Abbott, who banned mask and vaccine mandates, tests positive for Covid.” Another headline by Yahoo! News reads, “Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who opposes vaccine and mask mandates, tests positive for COVID-19.” Another one by The Guardian reads, “Texas governor Greg Abbott, who fought mask mandates, tests positive for Covid.”1 2 3\n\nA CNN headline reads, “Gov. Abbott tests positive for Covid-19 after months of blocking mask mandates.” One more—this one by BuzzFeed News: “Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Tested Positive For COVID-19, As He Fights Mask Mandates.”4 5\n\nThere appears to be an orchestrated effort by the mainstream media of trying to convey a subtle message of poetic justice that goes something like this: “That’ll teach Abbott for being such an obstructionist on mask mandates in his state. Serves him right.” It is a message that is consistent with a disturbing and growing tendency by some Americans to shame and vilify fellow Americans who do not share their enthusiasm for every government COVID-related mandate that comes along.\n\nMedia Tries to Tie Abbott’s Coronavirus Infection to His Stance on Mask Mandates\n\nAll of these articles are supposed to be news articles, but from the start they already betray a clear political bias. Gov. Abbott and Gov. Rick DeSantis of Florida have been taking a lot of heat lately from government officials and the media for prohibiting cities and school boards in their states from passing mask mandates for children attending schools. Both Abbott and DeSantis believe that parents should decide whether or not their children wear masks in schools.6 7 8\n\nIn a statement on July 29, 2021 about the Executive Order he signed on May 18 prohibiting government entities in Texas from mandating masks,9 Gov. Abbott said:\n\n[Parents] have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses, and engage in leisure activities. Vaccines, which remain in abundant supply, are the most effective defense against the virus, and they will always remain voluntary—never forced—in the State of Texas7\n\nIn other words, Gov. Abbott’s order doesn’t prohibit children from wearing masks in schools, it simply prohibits Texas state authorities from forcing them to do so.\n\nOn Aug. 15, the Texas Supreme Court upheld Gov. Abbott’s mask mandate prohibition by granting a request for a “temporary, emergency stay” of an appellate court ruling that would have allowed schools in Dallas and Bexar counties to require masks. In another case involving Travis county, the Texas Supreme Court on Aug. 19 denied Gov. Abbott’s request to “block temporary restraining orders” on his mask mandate prohibition. That decision effectively allows schools that require students to wear masks, in defiance of Gov. Abbott’s mask mandate prohibition, to proceed.10\n\nOn Aug. 3, President Joe Biden called out Gov. Abbott, Gov. DeSantis and other governors for “passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.” Biden noted, “As of now, seven states not only banned mask mandates, but also banned them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated.”7 He added:\n\nLook, we need leadership from everyone. If some governors are not willing to do the right thing, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing, to be able to do it. I say to these governors, please help. If you’re not going to help, at least get out of the way of the people trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.6 7 11\n\nMore recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona admonished Gov. Abbott and Gov. DeSantis for their executive orders on mask mandates. In a letter to Gov. Abbott, Secretary Cardona wrote that his order “may infringe upon a school district’s authority to adopt policies to protect students and educators as they develop their safe return to in-person instruction plans required by federal law.”12 Cardona added:\n\nThe Department [of Education] stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction.12\n\nAbbott Received Three COVID Shots and Still Got Coronavirus\n\nThe bias that is evident in some of the media coverage about Gov. Abbott’s positive test for coronavirus seems aimed at pressuring Abbott to see the error of his ways by seeking to remind him how contagious is the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for requiring people to abide by the federal government’s masking recommendations. But perhaps the media bias is also meant to distract from a more noteworthy detail of this story, which is that Gov. Abbott is fully vaccinated.\n\nGov. Abbott received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) biologic (known as BNT162b2 or Comirnaty vaccine) on Dec. 22, 2020 and likely received the second dose in January 2021. He reportedly received a third shot—a booster dose—as well. “Governor Abbott is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, in good health, and currently experiencing no symptoms,” said Mark Miner, the governor’s communications director.13 14 15 16 17\n\nSo even with three Comirnaty shots in less than one year, Gov. Abbott still tested positive for coronavirus? That would seem to be the most relevant and concerning point on which to focus. Not his stand on mask mandates.\n\nGov. Abbott can now be added to the growing club of so-called “breakthrough cases” of Americans who contracted coronavirus despite being fully vaccinated. The latest rough estimate of the number breakthrough cases in the United States is 193,204, as reported recently by The Wall Street Journal.18 That figure, however, is based on data provided by only by 44 state health departments and a lack of understanding of how many vaccinated Americans have been asymptomatically infected, so you can bet that the estimate is woefully low.18 19 20 21\n\nIt is worth noting that there are some media sources that have at least made an effort to highlight the relevance of Gov. Abbott’s vaccination status. NBC affiliate WAVY-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia reported, “Gov. Greg Abbott tests positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated.” Similar examples, though, are rare\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nNote: This commentary provides referenced information and perspective on a topic related to vaccine science, policy, law or ethics being discussed in public forums and by U.S. lawmakers.

        "A scholarly article published in a medical journal, in which authors concluded that a “lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy,” has been retracted less than two weeks after publication. The article entitled “The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations—We Should Rethink the Policy” was published by MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) on June 24, 2021 and analyzed the information from international databases. The article was retracted on July 2.1\n\nThe article’s authors used a large Israeli field study that included approximately one million people to calculate the number of individuals needed to vaccinate in order to prevent one infection and death caused by COVID-19. They then extracted numbers of side effects reported to the Dutch National Register for the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines to calculate risk. Their findings indicated that “for three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination… thus placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude.”1\n\nUnderplaying Adverse Reactions by National Authorities and Media Outlets\n\nThe article’s authors suggested that “perhaps it might be necessary to dampen the enthusiasm with sober facts,”1 stating the need for independent science case reviews of severe reactions, reconsideration of national policies, and evidence-based recommendations for vaccination on an individual case-by-case basis.\n\nThis stance is echoed in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article, which criticizes the lack of media representation about the potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the politicization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccine. The authors state that public health authorities are risking the public’s trust by not being forthcoming about potential harms from the vaccine, and that “the battle to recover scientific honesty will be an uphill one in the U.S.”2\n\nResearchers Resign Following Widespread Criticism and Article Retraction\n\nThe website Gizmodo was quick to publish an article entitled “Journal Retracts Terrible Study that Claimed Widespread Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths” two days following retraction of the journal article.3 The Gizmodo author states that the article was condemned as flawed and irresponsible by other scientists and that the well-respected researchers have since resigned from association with the journal. Following criticism, the journal article was retracted after the journal’s editors said they found “several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.”3\n\nMainstream Media Alleges VAERS is Source of “Misinformation”\n\nGizmodo reports that adverse reporting systems such as the one used by the researchers who published the retracted article are designed to report any health problem or death after using a new drug or vaccine, but that the reports don’t necessarily indicate the drug or vaccine caused the health problem or death. The Gizmodo article author states:\n\nBut caution should be warranted if someone starts making extraordinary claims about safety or lack thereof—especially if those claims are based on adverse event reporting systems.3\n\nVaccine adverse event reporting systems, which many people did not know existed prior to the dissemination of experimental COVID-19 vaccines under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020,4 increasingly have been criticized by the media as the numbers of serious health problem have been reported following COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite being credited for identifying the blood clots associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine5 and myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines,6 many news outlets report that the U.S. based system VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is a tool used by those opposed to mandatory use of COVID-19 vaccine to emphasize vaccine risks and that the system is “ripe for abuse, misuse, and plain misunderstanding.”5\n\nThe CDC’s website describing VAERS clearly identifies limitations of using VAERS data to make conclusions about causal relationships between an adverse event report filed in VAERS and the vaccination(s) received. However, CDC officials also urge vaccine providers and recipients to report adverse events following vaccination to VAERS as required under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.7 There have been more adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations than for any other vaccine.8\n\nMost mainstream media outlets promoting the use of COVID-19 vaccine are critical of VAERS and minimize the significance of adverse event reports filed in VAERS. As ABC News states: “Although VAERS contains millions of reports of injuries following vaccinations, the vast majority of those injuries are coincidental.”5\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:"

        "Opinion | The mainstream media has been widely reporting that almost every person dying of COVID-19 in the United States these days is an unvaccinated person. There have been many articles published during the past three weeks alleging that 99.2 percent of those who died of COVID-19 in the U.S. in May 2021 had not been vaccinated. All of these articles cite an “analysis” done by the Associated Press (AP) and published on June 24, 2021.1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nReportedly, the AP analysis was based on data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .1 2 3 4 5 6 One article by WebMD made reference to a “new report The Associated Press released looking at COVID-19 deaths during May 2021.”7\n\nThe impression left by the article describing the analysis is that the AP published some sort of paper or study breaking down the number of COVID-19 deaths that occurred among fully vaccinated people versus unvaccinated people. But this doesn’t appear to be the case. All the reporting about an AP analysis has been about a relatively short news article written by AP reporters Carla K. Johnson and Mike Stobbe and titled “Nearly all COVID deaths in U.S. are now among unvaccinated.”3\n\nIn their article, Johnson and Stobbe said the Associated Press analysis looked at CDC data and found “more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May.” They did not explain specifically how they come up with that figure. They simply said that the “AP analyzed figures provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”3\n\nWhere Did the COVID-19 Death Stats Come From?\n\nIf you go to the COVID Data Tracker section on the CDC’s website and look under the heading “Trends in Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory” and sort by “Daily Deaths” under “View(left axis):” the bar chart will provide New Deaths per day and the 7-day Moving Avg Deaths. Under the chart, there is a subhead titled “Data Table for Daily Death Trends – United States.” If you click on it, a table will open up and display the New Deaths and the 7-Day Moving Avg, as well as Historic Deaths, in the U.S. all the way back to Jan. 22, 2020.8\n\nIf you add up the number of new deaths in May, the total comes out to 15,336, not the “more than 18,000” mentioned by Johnson and Stobbe. So where did that figure come from? If you go back to the “View(left axis):” box and sort by “Daily Cases” and then look at the 7-Day Moving Avg Cases for May 31, 2021, the figure provided is 18,137, but that is clearly not a total for the month and it has to do with coronavirus infections, not deaths.8\n\nCDC Unsure What Percentage of Vaccinated People are Dying of COVID\n\nJohnson and Stobbe said that “only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people.” Assuming that figure of 150 is accurate, the assumption—because there is no way to know for sure the vaccination status of everyone believed to have died of COVID—would be that the more than 17,850 remaining deaths must have involved unvaccinated people. As an article in Forbes in June noted, “In other words, 99.2% of the people who died from COVID-19 last month weren’t fully vaccinated against the virus.”5\n\nBut as Johnson and Stobbe noted:\n\nThe CDC itself has not estimated what percentage of hospitalizations and deaths are in fully vaccinated people, citing limitations in the data. Among them: Only about 45 states report breakthrough infections, and some are more aggressive than others in looking for such cases. So the data probably understates such infections, CDC officials said.3\n\nIf the CDC doesn’t know how many fully vaccinated people have died of COVID-19, then what methodology did the AP analysis use to conclude that only about 150 people in the U.S. died of COVID-19 in May? And, by extension then, how can it be concluded from the AP analysis that 99.2 percent COVID-19 deaths in May were among unvaccinated people? What are the other “limitations in the data” supposedly cited by the CDC?\n\nFauci Warns 99.2 Percent of COVID Deaths are Among Unvaccinated People\n\nJudging by the media’s reporting of the findings of the AP analysis, the idea that people vaccinated for COVID-19 have little chance of dying of the disease while the unvaccinated have a high risk of death from it has been aggressively pushed—apparently in an effort to help increase vaccination rates, which have been slowing since April in the U.S.9 10\n\nNow, even some high-profile U.S. health officials like Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which co-developed with Moderna an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine being distributed under emergency use authorization (EUA), have started referring to the findings of the AP analysis, without actually citing the AP as the source. This gives the impression that they are government findings, thereby giving them more weight.11 12 13 In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on July 4, Dr. Fauci said:\n\nWell, if you look at the number of deaths, about 99.2 percent of them are unvaccinated. About 0.8 percent are vaccinated. No vaccine is perfect, but when you talk about the avoidability of hospitalization and death, it’s really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable. I mean, obviously there are going to be some people, because of the variability among people and their response to vaccine that you’ll see some who are vaccinated and still get into trouble and get hospitalized and die. But the overwhelming proportion of people who get into trouble are the unvaccinated.13\n\nFact vs. Fiction?\n\nAs the 99.2 percent figure gets recycled in newspaper and magazine articles and on television, many Americans may come to accept it as a scientific fact. They will assume it is based on accurate data provided by the government or a peer-reviewed study published in a medical journal, rather than an article by a news agency that reads more like an opinion piece than anything else. Note the opening of the Johnson/Stobbe article:\n\nNearly all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. now are in people who weren’t vaccinated, a staggering demonstration of how effective the shots have been and an indication that deaths per day—now down to under 300—could be practically zero if everyone eligible got the vaccine.3\n\nBoy, talk about a case of false advertising disguised as science-based journalism. It would be helpful if the CDC would publish the data to back up the AP analysis.\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nNote: This commentary provides referenced information and perspective on a topic related to vaccine science, policy, law or ethics being discussed in public forums and by U.S. lawmakers.

        "Originally posted at ClimateREALISM\n\nThis past week, both the U.S. and Europe have had significant localized heatwaves. The one in Europe is particularly bothersome for the media, since the area is not prepared for temperatures that exceed 100°F like areas in the in the United States in places like California, Texas, and Oklahoma, where air conditioners are the norm, regularly experience. The mainstream media has uniformly blamed the heatwaves on human caused climate change. This attribution is wrong.\n\nThe headlines have been truly apoplectic, and absolutely wrong. For example:\n\nWith Record-Breaking Heat, Europe Glimpses Its Climate Future [Scientific American]\n\nClimate change is killing people’: Europe’s extreme heatwave continues [EuroNews]\n\n‘Climate change affects everyone’: Europe battles wildfires in intense heat [Reuters]\n\nAnd in the United States, the media hype is just as wild and just as false:\n\nRecord-breaking heat waves in US and Europe prove climate change is already here, experts say [Yahoo News]\n\nThe climate crisis is driving heat waves and wildfires. Here’s how [CNN]\n\nHow the heat dome in Texas is related to climate change [Yahoo News]\n\nEvery summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it gets hot; that’s what summers do. Also, every year, a localized heatwave occurs somewhere in the world.\n\nThe error that is common to all of these news articles is the fact that weather is not climate.\n\nWeather is an event that might last for minutes to a few days. A heatwave is a weather event that is typically linked to large scale weather patterns, such as a high-pressure cell which can create heat-domes in the summer. Climate is an average of weather over a thirty-year period as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. Note my highlights:\n\nEach of these stories trying to link climate change to the heat wave does so without any proof whatsoever. They are nothing more than speculative fearmongering.\n\nAnd, it isn’t limited to print and Internet media, the TV stations are overhyping it as well to make it seem like a crisis with the use of color. Figure 1 is a comparison of TV graphics on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in Summer 2012, versus Summer 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of TV weather Maps from the BBC in summer 2012, left, and summer 2022 right. Source: BBC\n\nNote that in 2012, some of the temperatures were actually higher, and they didn’t need to fill in areas with red to make it look worse than it actually is.\n\nAnother thing that you won’t find reported in the BBC on in the newspapers/Internet media is the fact that while record heat was going on in Western Europe, Eastern Europe was experiencing well below average temperatures. Figure 2 below shows the juxtaposition of heat in the UK and Europe compared to the below normal temperatures in Eastern Europe, which the press has ignored.\n\nFigure 2: Surface Temperature map for UK and Europe on July 19, 2022. Image from ECMWF output via WeatherBell Inc.\n\nThat dramatic regional temperature difference seen in Figure 2 is a sure sign of this being a weather pattern, and not global scale climate change aka global warming as the media would have you believe. The same applies to the heat wave in the U.S. as seen in Figure 3. It is regional in its scope, not global.\n\nFigure 3: Maximum Temperature for the Contiguous United States July 21, 2022. Source NOAA:\n\nAs reported in Climate at a Glance: U.S. Heatwaves,\n\n…in recent decades in the United States, heat waves have been far less frequent and severe than they were in the 1930s.\n\nThe all-time high temperature records set in most states occurred in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe heat wave of 1936 was far deadlier. To their credit, The Washington Post got it right in this report:\n\nThe killer U.S. heat wave of 1936 spread as far north as Canada, led to the heat-related deaths of an estimated 5,000 people, sent thermometers to a record 121 degrees Fahrenheit in Steele, N.D., and made that July the warmest month ever recorded in the United States.\n\nBut the real issue is that extended high temperatures like the U.S. and Europe have experienced this month have happened before climate change became the universal go-to for blame. It only takes a small amount of research to discover these facts.\n\nA search of the term heatwaves, on Wikipedia, for instance, finds that a heatwave and drought in 1540 in Europe lasted for 11 months, and that a heatwave in 1757 was the hottest in the past 500 years until 2003. Also, Netweather Community TV, called the 1906 heatwave in the U.K during August and September, “one of the most exceptional heatwaves to ever occurred in the UK.” A 1911 heatwave in France contributed to more than 41,000 premature deaths. More recently, in Europe, there was a massive months-long heat wave in 1976. This came at a time when the Earth was experiencing a 30 year cooling trend, that led many scientists to warn the next ice age was looming. Wikipedia’s entry on the 1976 event reports:\n\nThe summer of 1976 was considered to be the hottest summer in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, during the 20th century. A large high-pressure area dominated most of Europe for all of the summer months. The pressure system moved into place in late May 1976 and remained until the first traces of rain were recorded on 27 August.\n\n. . .\n\nFor the entire period much of Europe was bathed in continual sunshine with the United Kingdom seeing an average of more than 14 hours of sunshine per day. 1976 was dubbed “the year of the ladybird” in that country due to the rise in the mass numbers of the insect brought on by the long hot period. In the United Kingdom, the summer coincided with a 16-week dry spell, the longest recorded over England and Wales since 1727.\n\nThat high pressure pattern is almost identical to what has been seen in UK and Europe today. The difference is that the media today immediately goes to blame climate change rather than weather patterns, and in the case of this article in The New York Times, they even try to convince you that comparisons between the hot summers of 1976 and 2022 are somehow “misleading.”\n\n“Yet the comparison to 1976 is misleading. The highest recorded temperature then was 35.9 degrees Celsius, whereas on Tuesday it surpassed 40 degrees.”\n\nThe BBC reported:\n\n“Thermometers hit 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, while 33 other locations went past the UK’s previous highest temperature of 38.7C, set in 2019.”\n\nFigure 4. Graph of Temperature at RAF Base Coningsby for July 19th, 2022 showing a max temp of 104°F, Source: WeatherUndergroud.com\n\nWhat the BBC and the NYT don’t tell you is that the 40 degree Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) was set at a Royal Air Force (RAF) base next to the heat absorbing sea of runway asphalt and tarmac. Figure 4 shows the temperature hour-by-hour that day and where it was recorded.\n\nBy contrast, the BBC reports “…the [previous] highest temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom was 101.7 degrees, observed in Cambridge [at Cambridge University Botanic Garden] in July 2019.“\n\nA botanical garden is an entirely different environment than an RAF air base. The latter would be expected to be much warmer due to the lack of shade, the heat absorbing materials present, and the hot air expelled from jet engines. So, the “misleading” claim of the NYT is really about the lack of solid journalism in reporting the environment under which these temperatures were recorded.\n\nIt is well-known that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect can contribute to warmer high temperatures, and given the UK went from 56 million people in 1976 to 67 million in 2020, it isn’t the least bit surprising that the UHI increased as infrastructure to support that 11 million extra people was added to that island nation.\n\nThe final word comes from meteorologist Cliff Mass, PhD, who did a thorough analysis of the short-lived heatwave event and writes (emphasis his):\n\nThe truth and overwhelming scientific evidence provide a different story: the recent European heatwave is mainly the result of natural processes but was enhanced modestly by human-caused global warming.\n\nThe situation is very much like the [Pacific] Northwest heatwave of last summer; with many of the same elements.\n\n…\n\nThe bottom line is that the recent European heat wave was caused by an amplification of the northern hemisphere wave pattern, with global warming contributing perhaps 5-10% of the warmth. Natural variability of the atmosphere was the proximate cause of the warmth and does not represent an existential threat to the population of Europe.\n\nClearly, there’s no cause for alarm, no matter what the media says. But the media won’t tell you any of that, because it ruins their narrative of being able to blame the heatwave on climate change, while hoping you don’t notice their distortion of the truth about ordinary weather events we see every summer.\n\nAnthony Watts\n\nAnthony Watts is a senior fellow for environment and climate at The Heartland Institute.

        "Fmr Top COVID-19 Official: COVID-19 Vaccines Were Never “Going To Protect Against Infection”\n\n(ZH) — A year ago, President Biden told the world during a now infamous CNN townhall that “you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.”\n\n“This is a simple, basic proposition: If you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you’re not going to die,” Biden added.\n\nBiden, exactly 1 year ago today: \"You won't get Covid if you're vaccinated\" Biden (quadruple vaxxed), today: Gets Covid 7/21/2021 CNN Town Hall w/ Biden: pic.twitter.com/RXHNnPzn0D — Daniel O'Connor (@DSDOConnor) July 21, 2022\n\nDid he knowingly lie to the American people?\n\nAs The Epoch Times’ Zachary Stieber reports, one of the former U.S. officials who led the COVID-19 response during the Trump administration said July 22 that COVID-19 vaccines were not expected to protect against infection.\n\n“I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection. And I think we overplayed the vaccines. And it made people then worry that it’s not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization,” Birx, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator under former President Donald Trump, said during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx: \"I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection and I think we overplayed the vaccines …\" Claims vaccines \"protect against severe disease and hospitalization\" before saying that 50% of those who died via Omicron were older & vaccinated. pic.twitter.com/CTifr3QZzX — Scott Morefield (@SKMorefield) July 22, 2022\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency use authorization in late 2020 to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, and were promoted by many health officials, including Birx. “This is one of the most highly-effective vaccines we have in our infectious disease arsenal. And so that’s why I’m very enthusiastic about the vaccine,” Birx said on an ABC podcast at the time. She made no mention of concerns the vaccines might not protect against infection. Data shows the vaccines did prevent infection from early strains of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, which causes COVID-19, but that the protection waned over time. The vaccines have proven increasingly unable to shield even shortly after administration, and provide little protection against the Omicron virus variant and its subvariants. The vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and hospitalization, Birx said on Friday. “But let’s be very clear—50 percent of the people who died from the Omicron surge were older, vaccinated,” she said. “So, that’s why I’m saying, even if you’re vaccinated and boosted if you’re unvaccinated, right now, the key is testing and Paxlovid,” she added. Paxlovid is a COVID-19 pill produced by Pfizer that has had uneven results in clinical trials and studies, but is recommended by U.S. health authorities for both unvaccinated and vaccinated COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe disease. President Joe Biden, who tested positive this week, was prescribed Paxlovid by his doctor. There are signs the protection from vaccines against severe illness is also dropping quickly as new strains emerge. That protection was just 51 percent against emergency department or urgent care visits, and dropped to just 12 percent after five months, according to a recent study. Against hospitalization, protection went from 57 percent to 24 percent. A booster increased protection but the shielding quickly dropped to substandard levels. Fauci Dr. Anthony Fauci also helped lead the U.S. pandemic response along with Birx and once said that vaccinated people would not get infected. “What was true two years ago, a year and a half ago, changes because the original ancestral strain did not at all have the transmission capability that we’re dealing with with the omicron sublineages, particularly BA. 5. So the vaccine does protect some people, not 95 percent, from getting infected, from getting symptoms, and getting severe disease. It does a much better job at protecting a high percentage of people from progressing from severe disease,” Fauci said on Fox. He said that vaccines with updated compilations, which are expected to debut in the fall, are necessary. “We need vaccines that are better. That are better because of the breadth and the durability, because we know that immunity wanes over several months. And that’s the reason why we have boosters,” he said. “But also, we need vaccines that protect against infection.”\n\nSponsored Content:"

        "Protesting Christian Principles by Practicing Christian Principles\n\nby Shari Dovale\n\nWe have heard quite a lot from the unhinged left as they attempt to trash Christians and their adherence to morals and principles. They call it logic when it is absurdity and consistently shows their ignorance. With the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they have gone completely off the rails with their attempts at making this a ‘moral’ issue. They are failing miserably.\n\nThe ‘Pro-Choice Is Really Pro-Life’ fallacy is consistently used to confuse young people into believing they are doing a righteous thing by killing the unborn life that is hindering their fun and pleasure. These youth are being disciplined to believe that self-indulgence is good for you and the preferred way of life.\n\nOne of the latest viral hashtags is #SexStrike. This is beyond laughable. Begun by the deranged D-List actress Alyssa Milano, this promotion of abstinence until they get unlimited abortion is being applauded by Christians around the globe.\n\nThe Bible tells us that sexual promiscuity is a sin:\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:3 – For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;\n\n1 Corinthians 6:18 – Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.\n\nGalatians 5:19 – The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;\n\nAnd for those that are still wondering when life begins, it actually begins Before conception:\n\nJeremiah 1:5 – “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”\n\nLet us now consider a recent poll conducted by Generation Lab/Axios. Majorities of young people have said that the new ruling from the Supreme Court will impact where they live and how they behave.\n\nMore than 60 percent of women between 18-29 years old and roughly 50 percent of men in that age group said how states handle abortion would at least “somewhat” affect where they choose to live.\n\nAdditionally, 29 percent of young women and 24 percent of young men said laws could impact how they choose sexual partners, how frequently they have sex (32 percent to 23 percent), and the way they use different forms of birth control.\n\nHallelujah!

Yet this is only true if seen from a public health perspective. If seen from a technological and strategic perspective, the response may be described as an unprecedented success.\n\nWithin months of the WHO pandemic declaration in March 2020, PCR genetic tests became widely available, Apple and Google inserted contact tracing interfaces into the operating systems of billions of mobile phones, and numerous governments had developed contact tracing apps. Within less than a year, novel “programmable” mRNA vaccines became available internationally. And in March 2021, Israel was the first country to introduce a digital vaccination certificate (“Green Pass”), followed by almost every other country in the world, including no-lockdown Sweden. Throughout this time, digital technologies were leveraged to manage remote work, remote learning and lockdowns, enforced in some places by the use of modern police drones and robotic dogs.\n\nNone of these innovations worked to contain or stop the pandemic, and none of them had been recommended by existing pandemic guidelines. Yet most of these policies were recommended by billionaire-funded organizations such as CEPI and GAVI, and many of them were publicly announced in March 2020 by the “world’s most powerful doctor” (Politico), Bill Gates, a major sponsor of the World Health Organization and a leading investor in mRNA vaccine technology.\n\nFurthermore, most of these innovations tie in neatly with other strategic initiatives, such as the WEF-linked ID2020 digital identity program, or they might be repurposed later on in the context of “climate change policy”, “terrorism prevention”, or Chinese-style “social credit” population control systems. In this regard, Israeli military historian and “WEF philosopher”, Yuval Harari, argued already in October 2020 that “Covid is critical, because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize total biometric surveillance.”\n\nIt is also noteworthy that while lockdowns, face masks and covid vaccines totally failed to stop coronavirus transmission, the false idea that they could stop transmission was crucial to justifying the introduction of QR-based digital vaccination certificates in the first place. The EU recently decided to extend the legal basis of these certificates for another year, while the US is about to fire 60,000 unvaccinated National Guard and reserve soldiers. In February, the WHO tasked Deutsche Telekom with building a global QR-based vaccine passport system.\n\nRead more: Did CEPI’s bio-spooks lock down the West? (TCW) and Cock-up or Conspiracy? Understanding COVID-19 as a ‘Structural Deep Event’ (Dr. Piers Robinson)\n\nThe Dubious SARS/MERS “Death Rate”\n\nA quite important yet mostly overlooked aspect of covid fearmongering was the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS and MERS. Specifically, the media and many scientists repeatedly stated that SARS had a “death rate” of 10% and MERS had a “death rate” of 35%, which made it seemingly reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-like coronavirus, might also have a “death rate” of at least several percent and might kill hundreds of millions of people, or even a third of mankind.\n\nYet a quick review of these “death rates” shows that these are not, of course, infection fatality rates, but case fatality rates, and the “cases” were not just any cases, but mostly patients hospitalized with a severe case of SARS or MERS. This is because during both the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 and the MERS outbreak in 2012-2015, there was not yet any PCR mass testing available, and only severe cases were tested at all.\n\nThus, it is quite likely that the original SARS and MERS outbreaks were in fact larger than recorded, and the SARS and MERS infection fatality rates in the general population were much lower, perhaps only a fraction of one percent, similar to the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIronically, if the recent pandemic had been caused by an aggressive influenza virus instead of a coronavirus, the actual death rate, especially in young people, could have been much higher.\n\nSee also: Covid fatality rates (SPR)\n\nChina and Zero Covid\n\nChina is the last country on Earth to still pursue a hopeless “zero covid” policy, and Chinese authorities continue to impose devastating lockdowns on major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Various theories have been proposed as to why China would follow such a seemingly irrational and destructive policy, including “China is deceiving the West”, “China is putting health over profits”, or “China deliberately disrupts Western supply chains”.\n\nYet most likely, the Chinese government simply doesn’t want to admit defeat against coronavirus. Furthermore, the fact that the US suffered one million covid deaths and India suffered three to five million covid deaths, while China until 2022 had suffered very few covid deaths, is seen as confirmation that China is in fact a superior civilization.\n\nThe Chinese government is also perhaps the most technocratic government in the world, and they are the only government that has even tried to preempt or disrupt aerosol transmission, which comes at an enormous economic and social cost. Finally, the Chinese government likely sees covid as an opportunity to further enhance its QR-based population control scheme.\n\nRemarkably, though, Beijing city authorities recently had to withdraw a planned vaccination mandate for some public venues after massive online protest by citizens.\n\nTo get a glimpse of the Chinese “zero covid” reality, see the eye-opening Twitter video channel of “Songpinganq” (16+, contains disturbing footage). To learn more about the Chinese digital “social credit” system, see this 5-minute report by France24.\n\nSee also: Did China stage the early covid videos? (SPR)\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nAs previously discussed, the novel coronavirus almost certainly emerged out of US-Chinese virological research. Moreover, the current omicron variant, which features two dozen immune-evasive spike mutations “copied from scientific publications”, most likely emerged from pan-coronavirus vaccine research (presumably in a South African lab).\n\nThus, within the span of just three years, the world has likely seen not one, but two man-made virus pandemics. After the delta variant, several countries with covid infection rates above 70% had achieved a kind of “herd immunity” and had seen the return of influenza viruses (e.g. India, Brazil and Sweden); yet the immune-evasive (but milder) omicron variant has undone this achievement and has launched several massive new waves within just a few months.\n\nMost recently, the Chair of the Lancet Covid Commission, US professor Jeffrey Sachs, stated that he is “pretty convinced [SARS-CoV-2] came out of US lab biotechnology, not out of nature” and that this is “not being investigated, not in the United States and not anywhere, for real reasons… I believe they do not want to look under the rug too much.” Professor Sachs also wrote an in-depth article and a scientific paper on the likely origins of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA lab-related virus origin either in China or in the US, and either accidental or deliberate – all of these possibilities remain entirely plausible. In particular, a deliberate release does not even have to be a “conspiracy”, as any single researcher involved in this type of research could decide to release such a pathogen, as the US FBI (falsely) claimed in the case of the 2001 anthrax letters.\n\nSee also: On the Origins of SARS-CoV-2 (SPR)\n\nWhy Face Masks Have Failed\n\nIt has been known for decades that face masks don’t work against respiratory virus epidemics, and the current coronavirus pandemic has once again confirmed this reality. Even N95/FFP2 masks have had no impact on infection rates in the general population, neither in Germany and Austria, nor in Taiwan and South Korea (which saw record infection rates in recent months).\n\nA recent Australian study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has finally shown why face masks fail so badly. The experimental study for the first time used actual virus aerosols (of a virus harmless to humans) and actual human participants (not puppet heads) in an aerosol chamber.\n\nThe study found that neither face masks nor unfitted N95 masks had any measurable effect on virus loads in the nostrils of study participants (fig. 2B); only fit-tested N95 masks significantly and strongly reduced virus loads in nostrils, as they prevent aerosols from bypassing the mask.\n\nThis result is fully consistent with real-world observations that face masks and N95 masks worn by the general population are useless, whereas fit-tested N95 masks worn by medical professionals can make a real difference – although during an epidemic, medical professionals may then get infected at home or during social activities, as masks cannot be worn 24/7.\n\nSee also: The Face Mask Folly in Retrospect (SPR)\n\nThe Dark Side of Covid Vaccine Trials\n\nHow sincere were the original covid vaccine trials?\n\nIt was already known that the Russian Sputnik vaccine trial most likely forged its results (to achieve an efficacy at least as high as Western mRNA vaccines). It was also known that both AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson declared some severe adverse events that were likely related to the vaccine – a case of transverse myelitis and a case of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis – as being “unrelated”.\n\nFurthermore, it was known that the Pfizer vaccine trial had strangely excluded, without explanation, five times more people from the vaccine group than from the control group.\n\nPfizer and the US FDA attempted to hide the original Pfizer vaccine trial documents for a full 75 years, but a determined New York lawyer forced them to immediately release the documents on a monthly basis. While almost totally ignored by traditional media, many of these documents have already been analyzed by independent investigators who coordinate themselves on Twitter.\n\nTheir preliminary results indicate that Pfizer and its subcontractors (which ran the trial sites) really may have suppressed some serious vaccine adverse events (by excluding the participants or by miscategorizing the events) and may have exaggerated vaccine efficacy to some extent (by not testing symptomatic participants or by simply excluding positive participants).\n\nThere have also been claims that hidden anti-N antibody data showed that the Pfizer vaccine actually had zero efficacy, but this was not the case: most of these infections occurred prior to the second vaccine dose or shortly thereafter.\n\nTo learn more about the dark side of the Pfizer vaccine trial, take a look at the following articles:\n\nThe covid vaccines may have saved a few million lives in 2021, mainly by mitigating the alpha and delta waves in Europe, the United States and elsewhere (though not “20 million lives” as recently claimed by some Gates-funded researchers). But vaccine protection even against severe disease is rapidly waning: the Netherlands recently reported 77% protection after four doses weeks ago, 63% protection after three doses months ago, and 0% protection after two doses a year ago.\n\nOverall, covid vaccines may yet win a Nobel Prize in Medicine, or turn out to be the biggest medical scandal in recent history, or perhaps both. At any rate, the vaccination of people not at risk of severe acute covid was almost certainly a mistake, and in some cases a crime.\n\nSee also: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events (SPR)\n\nCovid Drugs I: The Failure of Antivirals\n\nTo treat covid, pharmaceutical companies mostly focused on the development of novel and rather expensive antiviral drugs. Yet all of these drugs, sold for billions of dollars to desperate health authorities, ultimately failed.\n\nAntiviral drugs that were given only to hospitalized patients with severe covid had to fail almost by definition, as most of these patients had already progressed to the post-viral, hyper-inflammatory phase of covid. This was the case of convalescent plasma therapy and Gilead’s highly expensive yet toxic and totally ineffective Remdesivir.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies, which were given to high-risk outpatients as quickly as possible, initially proved effective, but they lost the battle against new coronavirus mutations.\n\nMerck’s Molnupiravir was a non-starter, both ineffective against most variants and dangerously mutagenic (“avoid unprotected sex for 30 days after treatment”).\n\nPfizer’s Paxlovid, which directly inhibits the main coronavirus replication enzyme, looked most promising. Yet it soon turned out that it was effective only in unvaccinated high-risk patients, not in standard-risk patients or in vaccinated high-risk patients. Moreover, up to half of all patients experienced a “covid rebound” immediately after discontinuing the drug; the side effect profile was worse than expected (“Paxlovid mouth”); and SARS-CoV-2 quickly started developing Paxlovid-resistant mutations. Another expensive bummer.\n\nSPR had warned in advance that Remdesivir was a fraud, Molnupiravir was outright dangerous, and Paxlovid might lead to rapid reinfections. The reality is that antiviral drugs may simply not be the ideal choice against a ubiquitous and fast-mutating respiratory virus.\n\nCovid Drugs II: Ivermectin, HCQ, and more\n\nGiven the many issues with antiviral drugs, another approach to tackle covid is to try to improve the immune response and to mitigate the health impact of the virus.\n\nAt the population level, this could be done by reducing obesity rates, since obesity has been shown to be linked to an ineffective and even destructive immune response. It could also be done by removing any deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (e.g. vitamin D and zinc).\n\nTwo of the most controversial covid treatments during the pandemic have been Nobel Prize-winning anti-parasitic drug ivermectin and history-making anti-malaria drug HCQ. Most trials of these and other off-patent drugs were rather pointless, involving low-risk participants, late administration, or unrealistic endpoints (e.g. infections or symptom duration instead of disease progression).\n\nNevertheless, concerning ivermectin, a yet unpublished, updated meta-analysis of non-fraudulent trials indicates that ivermectin is indeed about 30% effective at reducing severe and fatal covid. Furthermore, the lead investigator of the TOGETHER trial acknowledged in a leaked email that “there is a clear signal that ivermectin works in COVID patients”. The renowned French Institute Pasteur previously found a “more favorable clinical presentation” in a detailed coronavirus animal study.\n\nThe apparent usefulness of ivermectin is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, but due to the known immuno-modulatory and anti-asthma effects. This would also explain why Merck, in early 2021, claimed ivermectin was “not effective”: if anything, they only looked into anti-viral activity.\n\nConcerning HCQ, an updated retrospective study from the group of French professor Didier Raoult found a 30% effectiveness against death in hospitalized patients, and a similar or higher effectiveness in outpatients. A yet-to-be-published meta-analysis also found a 30% effectiveness against hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients.\n\nIn the case of HCQ, the apparent usefulness is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, either, but instead due to the known anti-coagulation and anti-autoimmune effects.\n\nIn sum, it looks like some of these medications could really have been beneficial in reducing the risk of severe covid, but they clearly did not “crush the curve” anywhere.\n\nSee also: On the treatment of covid (SPR)\n\nAsymptomatic Transmission: A Myth?\n\nMany authorities tried to use the idea of “asymptomatic transmission” to justify mask mandates and lockdowns, while many skeptics pushed back by arguing that “asymptomatic transmission” was a myth. In truth, asymptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic transmission are real and well-known from influenza and other viruses, but due to aerosol transmission, face masks and other restrictions still don’t work.\n\nSome recent press reports claimed that a new meta-study showed “asymptomatic transmission” was very rare, but the meta-study in fact showed the opposite: it found that pre-symptomatic transmission was just as likely as symptomatic transmission (risk ratio 1.00) and that it accounted for 30% to 50% of all transmission. Only people that remain fully asymptomatic throughout their infection are less likely to infect others (risk ratio 0.32), likely because of a lower viral load.\n\nIndeed, without insidious pre-symptomatic aerosol transmission – which doesn’t require any “droplets” produced by coughing or sneezing – the coronavirus pandemic would probably not have been possible. Given that aerosol transmission occurs almost only indoors and face masks are ineffective against aerosols, public health policy should likely focus on improving indoor air quality, especially in important public venues.\n\nSee also: Pre-symptomatic transmission is very real (SPR)\n\nLong Covid: Another Myth?\n\nSimilar to the case of “asymptomatic transmission”, many health authorities tried to use the risk of “long covid” to justify mask mandates or vaccination mandates even for young people, while many skeptics tried to push back by arguing that “long covid” was a myth or a psychological condition.\n\nYet ever since the summer of 2020, the clinical reality of long covid has been obvious, and it has also been clear that long covid can seriously impact the quality of life and performance even of previously healthy young people who had only seemingly mild covid.\n\nThe pathology of long covid isn’t a total mystery anymore, either. First, there are patients who do not (fully) recover their sense of taste or smell. Second, there are patients who show respiratory problems due to asthma-like conditions, gas exchange abnormalities, or lung perfusion (blood flow) issues (presumably due to endothelial damage). Third, there are patients who develop new-onset neurological or auto-immune conditions that are often difficult to diagnose.\n\nOn the other hand, heart inflammation is not generally a covid or long covid risk, but rather a covid vaccination risk, especially in young males.\n\nStudies that claim “long covid” is a myth typically make one of three mistakes: first, they compare non-specific symptoms unrelated to covid and long covid; second, they rely on unreliable antibody data; or third, they assume that if a general practitioner cannot identify a cause, no cause exists.\n\nIn this regard, a study recently published in Lancet eBioMedicine found that almost 50% of long covid patients that showed no SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did show a SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response (i.e. they had been infected). It is also known that some widely used antibody tests (e.g. Abbott) have a sensitivity of just 20% one year after mild infection.\n\nThe real questions concerning long covid are rather these: how many people are affected, how severe are these cases, what is the recovery rate, do reinfections increase the risk of long covid or exacerbate long covid, and are there any treatments?\n\nFor instance, a recent German insurance study found that among covid patients in 2020, 1% to 5% received a medical long covid diagnosis in 2021; the average long covid sick leave from work in 2021 was 90 days even in non-hospitalized patients, and 105 days overall.\n\nDenying long covid is about as reasonable as denying vaccine injuries. It is part of the complex reality of this pandemic, unfortunately, even though the condition has indeed in some cases been abused for fearmongering and political ends.\n\nRead more: Post-Acute Covid and Long Covid (SPR)\n\nChildren: Little Heroes or Big Losers?\n\nA comprehensive Icelandic study recently confirmed once more that covid remained asymptomatic or mild in almost all children, and that prior to omicron, almost 90% of infections in children occurred outside of school, mostly at home, and mostly from adults to children, not the other way around (omicron removed this difference to some extent).\n\nOn the other hand, UNESCO found that over 150 million children missed more than half a year of in-person schooling (and up to two years in some countries), which caused reading and math abilities to decline substantially, especially in developing countries. According to the World Bank, the pandemic response has caused “the worst educational crisis for a century, and certainly since the world wars.”\n\nChildren should have been the little invincible heroes of this pandemic, but unfortunately in many countries they have been turned into perhaps the biggest losers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this pandemic, it is to never repeat this mistake.\n\nSee also: Covid and Kids: The Evidence.

        "Published: June 2022\n\nShare on: TW / FB / TG\n\n\n\nMagic potion or snake oil? An honest look at the international data.\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior to the omicron variant, covid vaccine protection against infection decreased from 95% to 0% and protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens decreased from 95% to 50% within about half a year. Since omicron, which is both milder and more infectious, vaccine protection against infection decreases from 60% to 0% and protection against severe disease in senior citizens decreases from at most 80% to less than 50% within a few months.\n\nThere is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection.\n\nThus, while the risk/benefit ratio appears to remain positive in senior citizens and other covid risk groups, this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children, as vaccine adverse events remain an issue. Finally, both “vaccine passports” and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned.\n\nIntroduction: Different positions towards covid vaccines\n\nThere are three different, fundamental positions towards covid vaccines than can be distinguished:\n\nPositive/promotional: This is the position taken by vaccine manufacturers, many politicians and many (but not all) health agencies. It is typically driven by commercial or political considerations. In addition, many scientists who depend on government or industry money or who want to publish in high-impact journals have also taken a promotional position.\n\nNegative/adverse: This is the position taken by vaccine skeptics. An adverse position can be based on various considerations, such as: 1) a fundamental rejection of vaccines in general; 2) a rejection of covid vaccines in particular, e.g. due to their novel technology and/or limited trial data; 3) a rejection of vaccines produced by companies with no track record (Moderna, Biontech) or with a criminal track record (Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson, AstraZeneca); 4) or based on strategic considerations (e.g. ‘vaccine passports’ as potential tools of population control).\n\nNeutral / skeptical but open-minded: This is the position taken by some independent investigators and research groups, including Swiss Policy Research. This group of analysts tries to obtain and provide as comprehensive and as nuanced a picture as possible on both vaccine effectiveness and vaccine safety, as well as on strategic considerations.\n\nDifferent aspects of vaccine protection\n\nIn the following analysis, we will distinguish between protection against (symptomatic) infection and protection against severe disease (hospitalization, ICU, death). Furthermore, we will distinguish between the pre-omicron period and the omicron period, and between senior citizens and non-senior citizens. Unless otherwise stated, protection refers to mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) and is expressed in relative percentage terms.\n\nProtection against infection\n\nPrior to omicron (i.e. during the alpha and delta periods), several large studies showed that vaccine protection against symptomatic infection decreased from about 90%/95% shortly after vaccination to close to 0% within about half a year (Lancet). This decrease was first seen in Israel during the delta wave in summer 2021 (SPR).\n\nThere have been claims that vaccine protection “turns negative” at some point beyond half a year. However, based on the currently available data, it looks like vaccinated people, who enjoyed a lower infection rate for about half a year, are simply “catching up” with unvaccinated people, but their infection risk is not actually higher than in unvaccinated people without prior infection (which would require some kind of immune suppression). This analysis is backed by the fact that a “booster vaccination” restores protection against infection to the initial level, but again only for a short period of time (Lancet).\n\nSince omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50%-60% shortly after vaccination and decreases to 0% within 4 to 6 months. A booster vaccination restores protection to 50%-60%, but again only for a short period of time. (NEJM) The lower peak protection is due to the partial immune escape of the omicron variant.\n\nIn contrast to vaccine protection, a previous covid infection confers a more durable protection against re-infection (“natural immunity”). Prior to omicron, a previous covid infection provided 75% to 90% protection against re-infection for over a year, with only a slight decline (JAMA). Since omicron, a non-omicron infection 4 to 12 months earlier still provides a protection of 70% to 50% against re-infection with omicron, according to a study from Qatar (Lancet). According to a study from Denmark, which included more older people, protection decreased from 50% to 20% for a previous infection 6 months to 12+ months ago (Lancet).\n\nFurthermore, it has been shown that viral load and infectiousness are identical in unvaccinated and in vaccinated people (once infection occurs) (medRxiv). In addition, there is no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid (once infection occurs), contrary to countless claims on Twitter (“grateful to be vaccinated and boosted”). In other words, covid vaccination cannot prevent mild to moderate covid infection. There is also no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens (Nature).\n\nConcerning negative vaccine protection, there is one important exception: for about 7 to 10 days immediately after vaccination – especially after the first vaccination and apparently also after a later “booster vaccination” – the risk of infection is indeed increased, possibly due to the known, transient immune suppression (lymphocytopenia) and increased exposure (“post-vaccination spike”). This effect is important because it looks like in several countries, mass vaccination campaigns have indeed triggered new covid waves or amplified ongoing covid waves (if the vaccination campaign was running in parallel to such a wave, e.g. in Israel).\n\nIn sum, the fact that current covid vaccines provide only short-term, rapidly waning protection against infection and transmission means that covid vaccines do not contribute to infection control, neither at the individual level nor at the population level. However, contrary to claims by skeptics, there is also currently no evidence that vaccination increases infection rates (with the exception of the post-vaccination spike mentioned above). Rather, covid waves, similar to flu waves, oscillate at global and continental scales (e.g. between Western and Eastern Europe).\n\nThe fact that vaccine protection against infection and transmission is waning rapidly means that so-called “vaccine passports” are epidemiologically inappropriate or indeed counter­productive. For the same reason, vaccine mandates, even in healthcare workers, are medically unjustified. Based on Israeli data from early summer 2021, these facts had already been known before most countries even introduced such schemes.\n\nNevertheless, covid vaccines may provide protection against severe disease and death in high-risk groups. This question will be discussed in the next section.\n\nProtection against severe disease and death\n\nPrior to omicron, vaccine protection against severe disease in senior citizens (hospitalization, ICU and death) decreased from about 95% to about 60% within half a year (Lancet). It was this decrease that triggered the first booster campaigns, beginning in Israel in the summer of 2021. In younger people, the protection was somewhat more durable (about 80% after half a year) (Lancet).\n\nThe omicron variant has achieved substantial immune escape, and neutralization power of existing vaccines, which are still based on the spike protein of the original 2019 Wuhan variant, decreased by a factor of 10 to 50 compared to previous variants (SPR). Initially, it was uncertain if current vaccines would still provide any protection against omicron infection and severe disease.\n\nNevertheless, an analysis from Taiwan, which had almost no covid infections before experiencing a massive omicron wave in the spring of 2022, shows that in senior citizens (70+), a recent booster vaccination provides about 75% to 80% protection against covid death; in contrast, double vaccination (several months ago) provides only about 40% protection against death (TCDC).\n\nSimilarly, a British study on the risk of omicron hospitalization found that double vaccination months ago provided about 40% protection and a recent booster about 60% to 80% protection (Lancet). Clearly, the decisive point here is not the number of vaccinations, but rather the time since the last vaccination (as is the case with flu vaccination).\n\nA recent study from Qatar found higher values: two doses several months ago provided about 75% protection against severe disease or death, whereas a booster a few weeks ago provided about 90% protection. However, in the Qatar study, only 2% of participants were over 70 years of age, i.e. these results are not directly applicable to Western or Asian populations. (NEJM)\n\nThus, it looks like against omicron, vaccination several months ago reduces the risk of severe disease by about 50%, while recent vaccination may reduce the risk by about 75% (in senior citizens). It is possible that this continuing protection is due to a combination of limited levels of neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and the T-cell response (NIH).\n\nIn comparison, natural immunity from a previous infection (without any vaccination) provides more durable protection against severe disease upon reinfection. Prior to omicron, studies found a protection against hospitalization of about 90% for over a year with no declining trend (JAMA). Against omicron, the Qatar study, which included mostly young people, found a protection of 75% to 95% (NEJM). The important question of how strongly a previous (non-omicron) infection protects against severe omicron disease in senior citizens has not yet been answered.\n\nConcerning vaccine protection against severe disease, the decreasing immune response with age (so-called immunosenescence) is of importance. Most vaccine studies did not include very old citizens (80+) or nursing home residents, despite the fact that these are the groups most at risk of severe covid. Already in early 2021, studies showed that one third of people over 80 did not develop any neutralizing antibodies in response to covid vaccination, and that in nursing home residents, vaccine protection against infection reached at most 65%. (SPR)\n\nThis fact is important when analyzing country-level data, as will be done in the next section.\n\nUpdate: Official Dutch data shows that against severe disease caused by omicron, two vaccine doses (a year earlier) provide 0% protection, three doses 63%, and four doses 77%. New data from Qatar shows that even in people over 50, a previous infection provides 95% protection against severe disease upon reinfection with omicron for more than a year.\n\nCountry analyses\n\nVaccine study data reviewed above suggested that since omicron, protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months. Are these values consistent with what has been observed in various Western and Asian countries?\n\nThe analysis of vaccine protection against omicron is complicated by the fact that in terms of hospitalizations and deaths, the omicron variant itself is about 60% to 80% milder compared to previous variants (Lancet). Furthermore, the mildness and very rapid spread of omicron means that 50% to 70% of PCR+ hospitalizations and deaths are just “with covid”, not “from covid”, compared to about 10% to 20% during previous covid waves (SSI). Finally, the fact that many people already had a previous covid infection further adds to the complexity of calculating vaccine protection.\n\nEven excess mortality data can be difficult to interpret. This is because of pandemic and lockdown-related non-covid deaths (e.g. from cancer and heart disease); a return of strong flu waves in several countries; potential vaccine deaths; and seasonal factors (e.g. an out-of-season covid wave causes higher relative excess mortality than a seasonal wave).\n\nNevertheless, it is worth taking a look at real-world data from some notable countries.\n\nSwitzerland: Switzerland is an interesting case because it is the only country that has been using mainly the high-dosed Moderna vaccine (40% Moderna, 25% Pfizer, 30% unvaccinated). Swiss authorities provide detailed covid hospitalization and death data per age group and vaccination status (BAG, in English). Thus, one can see that during the two omicron waves in January and March 2022, double-vaccination provided still about 60% protection and recent booster vaccination provided about 90% to 80% protection against severe disease in senior citizens. Furthermore, Moderna provided consistently higher protection compared to Pfizer.\n\nHong Kong: Hong Kong is another fascinating case, as it had almost no infections for two years but then experienced a record-breaking omicron wave in February/March 2022 with very high covid death figures. At first glance this looked like total vaccine failure, but a closer inspection showed that vaccination rates in senior citizens were only 30% to 50%; 60% of deaths occurred in nursing homes; 90% of deaths were not yet double-vaccinated; and excess mortality was only about 65% of covid mortality (i.e. a third of PCR+ deaths weren’t actually covid deaths).\n\nA comparison with Taiwan (80% booster rate in senior citizens (TCDC)) shows that the omicron wave in Taiwan reached about 40% of peak infections, but only 20% of peak deaths compared to Hong Kong (OWD). Thus, the case of Hong Kong does not contradict vaccine protection.\n\nAustralia: Due to strict border controls, Australia largely avoided pre-omicron infection waves, but the country has experienced several large omicron waves from January to June 2022. Compared to Hong Kong, total cases stand at 200%, but total deaths stand at only 30% (despite a much higher obesity rate in Australia); compared to the UK, total Australian PCR cases currently stand at 90%, but total PCR+ deaths stand at only 15% (per capita) (OWD). Thus, Australian data, too, appears to be consistent with continuing vaccine protection in senior citizens.\n\nIsrael: Covid vaccination pioneer Israel is the only European country that suffered higher excess mortality during the first omicron wave than during previous waves (EuroMomo). Nevertheless, official Israeli data shows that during the omicron wave, recently vaccinated senior citizens (3rd or 4th dose) had a 90% lower risk of severe disease, and senior citizens vaccinated a few months ago still had a 50% lower risk compared to unvaccinated citizens (IMH). The Israeli omicron wave was ten times higher than any previous wave in Israel, and it was higher even than the omicron wave in Hong Kong one month later (OWD). It is possible that the Israeli wave was so explosive because Israel once again vaccinated right into an ongoing wave.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see that real-world data from several countries are consistent with a short-term vaccine protection against severe disease in the range of 50% to 90%.\n\nNevertheless, even highly vaccinated populations continue to see non-trivial levels of covid disease. This is likely because of several factors: first, vaccination simply cannot limit transmission; second, vaccine protection against severe disease is typically only twofold to five-fold (50% to 80%) and not twenty-fold (95%); and third, omicron, although milder, has produced unprecedented infection rates (ten times higher than during previous waves).\n\nUpdated vaccines and antigenic priming\n\nWill updated omicron vaccines improve protection against omicron infection and disease? It looks like this is not going to be the case, as prior vaccination or prior infection has “primed” the immune response to the pre-omicron virus or spike protein, and an updated vaccine can no longer significantly change the immune response (so-called antigenic priming) (Nature).\n\nModerna recently reported that its updated omicron vaccine increased neutralizing antibodies against omicron by a factor of 8, but a factor of 8 is very low (not even one order of magnitude), especially since the baseline was very low already, and it only applies to people without any prior infection, which by now is a small minority (Moderna).\n\nIt has also been shown that vaccinated people, once infected, often produce antibodies only against the spike (S) protein (as induced by the vaccine), but not against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the virus, in contrast to unvaccinated people (NIH). The significance of this limited immune response in vaccinated people is not yet clear, as anti-N antibodies are not neutralizing antibodies, and children often do not produce anti-N antibodies, either (Nature). Anti-N antibodies could be beneficial, irrelevant, or even detrimental against future variants and infections.\n\nIn sum, it looks like SARS-CoV-2 antigenic priming now is a reality, both in vaccinated and in previously infected people, and current vaccine products are unlikely to significantly improve their effectiveness against future variants. On the other hand, there is still no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of covid infection or disease.\n\nRapidly declining effectiveness is not unique to covid vaccines; rather, it is a phenomenon already known from influenza vaccines (CID). Indeed, it looks like injecting specific antigens is simply not an ideal long-term strategy in the fight against quickly mutating respiratory viruses.\n\nDistorting vaccine protection\n\nVaccine protection can be exaggerated (by vaccine promoters) or downplayed (by vaccine skeptics).\n\nTypical methods to exaggerate vaccine protection are: 1) not counting infections shortly after vaccination (“vaccinated” vs. “injected”); 2) counting patients with missing vaccination data as “unvaccinated”; 3) using outdated population data to exaggerate infections and hospitalizations in the unvaccinated; 4) quoting peak protection without acknowledging the rapid decline.\n\nTypical methods to downplay vaccine protection are: 1) Ignoring infection rates when comparing death rates; 2) confounding age groups; 3) comparing vaccinated to recovered people instead of unexposed people (“negative protection”); 4) not distinguishing between with/from covid (especially since omicron).\n\nVaccine skeptics have correctly pointed out that in addition to relative effectiveness, one should also consider absolute effectiveness, which strongly depends on age. For instance, a 90% relative effectiveness translates into an absolute reduction of pre-omicron covid lethality from 1% to 0.1% (i.e. –0.9%) in senior citizens (outside of nursing homes) and from 0.05% to 0.005% in 45-year-old people (i.e. –0.045%) (SPR).\n\nVaccine injuries\n\nWhile the current review has focused on vaccine protection only, it should be recalled that covid vaccines are first-generation investigational vaccines with controversial short-term safety data, especially in young people, and still unknown long-term safety data.\n\nIndeed, in several countries authorization of some covid vaccine brands has already been denied, withdrawn, or limited to certain age groups due to significant safety signals. Serious vaccine adverse events include cardiovascular, neurological and immunological conditions. Additional booster vaccinations could further increase covid vaccine adverse events.\n\nRead more: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events: An Overview (SPR)\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth vaccine study data and real-world data reviewed above suggest that since omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months.\n\nFurthermore, there is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection.\n\nThus, while the risk/benefit ratio may still be positive in senior citizens and other risk groups (based on current evidence), this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children. Danish professor in global health and vaccine expert, Dr. Christine Stabell-Benn, recently stated that she “wouldn’t recommend vaccination of anybody under 50 years of age.”\n\nFinally, both “vaccine passports” and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned.\n\nYou have been reading: How effective are covid vaccines, really?\n\nAn analysis by Swiss Policy Research.\n\nFigures\n\n1) Taiwan: Vaccine protection against death during the omicron wave\n\n2) Pre-omicron vaccine protection against infection and severe covid (Sweden)\n\n3) Switzerland: Vaccine protection against hospitalization (70-79)\n\n4) Qatar (only 2% over 70): Previous infection and vaccination against omicron infection\n\n5) Same viral load in vaccinated and unvaccinated people (delta)\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nShare on: Twitter / Facebook / Telegram"

        "NRL successfully transmits electrical energy using microwave technology\n\nThe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), a research facility of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, has successfully transmitted 1.6 kilowatts of electrical energy over one kilometer by converting electricity into microwaves, which are then sent to a receiver in a directed beam using a dish as a transmitting antenna.\n\nAccording to the NRL, this is the most significant demonstration of power beaming in nearly 50 years.\n\nThe concept is simple: Electricity is converted to microwaves, which are then focused in a tight beam at a receiver made up of rectenna elements. These components consist of an x-band dipole antenna with an RF diode. When the microwaves strike the rectenna, the elements then generate DC current.\n\nMicrowave power beaming is a point-to-point transfer of electrical energy across free space using a directed microwave beam. It is received with the rectifying antenna, which consists of large numbers of small microwave antennas. These works in the X-Band, which is the frequency range falling between seven and 11.2 gigahertz (GHz). A diode then converts the incoming electromagnetic waves back into the DC electrical power. In this particular demonstration system, the NRL used a 10 GHz band as the technology being used is considered to be mature and available at low costs.\n\nPaul Jaffe, a researcher on power beaming and space-based solar power, explained that the NRL set its targets to push the technology farther than has been demonstrated before. The frequency was chosen because it can beam even in heavy rain with a loss of power of under five percent, but it is also safe to use under international standards in the presence of birds, animals and even people.\n\nDespite initial doubts, microwave beaming turned out to be surprisingly efficient, and the the Advanced Concepts Group team led by Christopher Rodenbeck has been tasked to develop the Safe and Continuous Power Beaming-Microwave (SCOPE-M) project that could explore the practicality of fielding the technology.\n\nThe NRL also stated that power beaming is the ultimate green technology. Unlike other sources, power beamed from space to Earth could provide power continuously for an entire year. (Related: Green power dangers: Scientists review the downside of renewable energies.)\n\n“That is something no other form of clean energy can do today. From the standpoint of technology readiness level, I feel we are very close to demonstrating a system we can truly deploy and use in a DOD [Department of Defense] application.” Rodenbeck said.\n\nFuture use of beaming technology\n\nThe project was carried out in two locations. In the Maryland test version of the project, the beam operated at a 60 percent efficiency rating. The Massachusetts test did not reach the same peak, although it did have a higher power level, which meant that it delivered more energy. The technology is expected to one day be used to transmit power on Earth or from large orbital solar power stations, which could provide electricity to national grids 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nMeanwhile, the DOD would like to use the technology for wireless power transmission from space. According to drawn-up plans by the military, troops that are deployed abroad are to be supplied with energy via power beaming that would make them independent of fuel deliveries. China is also working on a similar concept for civilian use. (Related: US Navy’s solar satellite can open the way for solar farms in space.)\n\nWhile the project was a terrestrial power-beaming link, SCOPE-M electronics engineer Brian Tierney said it was a good proof of concept for space power beaming. “The main benefit of space to Earth power beaming for the DOD is to mitigate the reliance on the fuel supply for troops, which can be vulnerable to attack.”\n\nJaffe also said past experiments with laser power beaming using much higher power densities allowed engineers to successfully implement interlock systems, so if something were to approach the beam, it will turn itself off. “We did not have to do that with SCOPE-M because the power density was sufficiently low that it was intrinsically safe,” he said.\n\nFollow FutureScienceNews.com for more stories like this.\n\nWatch the video below to learn more about microwave energy weapons.\n\nThis video is from the Truth or Consequences channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nU.S. diplomats in Cuba were attacked by “microwave beam weapons.”\n\nPentagon’s solar panel in space could one day supply electricity to any place on Earth.\n\nA startup energy company claims to have created a stable fusion reactor that can supply the world with limitless energy.\n\nMysterious beams: Directed energy weapons (DEWs) linked to wildfires in California and Oregon.\n\nUS Navy’s solar satellite can open the way for solar farms in space.\n\nSources include:\n\nStrangeSounds.org\n\nNewAtlas.com\n\nNavy.Mil\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Scientists discover new solar waves that move three times faster than they thought possible\n\nA new study published on March 24 in Nature Astronomy has found a new set of waves on the Sun’s surface that don’t fit current theories.\n\nKnown as “high-frequency retrograde (HFR) waves,” the newly-detected waves travel in the opposite direction of the Sun’s rotation and emerge as a pattern of vortices on the Sun’s surface, moving three times faster than scientists thought was possible. (Related: Model for plasma flow on the Sun reveals secrets behind sunspots and other solar phenomena)\n\nSince the interior of the Sun and stars can’t be imaged by traditional means, scientists depend on interpreting the surface signatures of an array of waves to produce an image of what happens below the surface. These new HFR waves may yet be a significant piece of the puzzle in our knowledge of the stars.\n\nChris Hanson, the lead author of the research, said the new waves don’t appear to be a result of other commonly known waves and magnetism, gravity or convection.\n\n“If the high-frequency retrograde waves could be attributed to any of these three processes, then the finding would have answered some open questions we still have about the Sun. However, these new waves don’t appear to be a result of these processes, and that’s exciting because it leads to a whole new set of questions,” said Hanson, a solar physicist at New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi‘s Center for Space Science.\n\nResearchers studied space- and ground-based data to discover HFR waves\n\nThe researchers studied 25 years of space- and ground-based data to discover the HFR waves.\n\n“The very existence of HFR modes and their origin is a true mystery and may allude to exciting physics at play. It has the potential to shed insight on the otherwise unobservable interior of the Sun,” said Shravan Hanasoge, the paper’s co-author and astrophysicist at NYU Abu Dhabi’s Center for Space Science.\n\nThe study was directed by researchers from NYU Abu Dhabi’s Center for Space Science in cooperation with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and NYU.\n\nScientists originally thought that acoustic solar waves form near the Sun’s surface, thanks to the Coriolis effect wherein points on a rotating sphere’s equator seem to move quicker than points on its poles. The Coriolis effect is an apparent effect created by a rotating frame of reference. It happens when an object moving along a straight way is seen from a non-fixed frame of reference.\n\nAddressing the shortcomings in their knowledge might help the researchers gain a better understanding of the Sun’s interior in addition to getting a better sense of how the Sun affects Earth and other planets in the solar system. It could also provide insight into the same kind of high-frequency wave known as the Rossby waves, which had been seen crossing Earth’s oceans four times faster than current models can explain.\n\nAstronomers examine acoustic waves like these for the reason that we are still a long way from building technology capable of peeking deep into the Sun’s interior.\n\nNASA, ESA launch solar probes\n\nIn 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Parker Solar Probe, which was named after the late solar physicist Eugene Parker from Florida’s space coast. During the course of its seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe will move closer to the Sun than any other spacecraft in history. It has already broken speed records in just four years, traveling at a maximum speed of 430,000 mph. It has also done a series of astonishing discoveries about solar winds, high-energy particles and much more.\n\nIn February 2020, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the Solar Orbiter probe, which the agency created to study space weather; the heliosphere or the protective plasma bubble that encloses our solar system; and the Sun’s poles, a mysterious area that has never been fully studied.\n\nExactly six months after it was launched, the Solar Orbiter was able to take a closer photo of the Sun. The particular image showed the presence of small solar flares named campfires, which could help explain why the Sun’s corona – the outermost layer of the Sun’s atmosphere – is hotter than its surface.\n\nThe discoveries these probes make could aid researchers in better foreseeing catastrophic space weather and comprehending how the Sun’s cycles affect physical procedures here on Earth.\n\nFollow Space.news to learn more about the Sun.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about massive solar flares and Sun anomalies.\n\nThis video is from the Space Anomalies channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nDiscovery: The sun’s magnetic waves react to sound.\n\nSolar telescope offers unprecedented glimpse into the Sun.\n\nSun erupting non-stop this month, giant explosions seen from its far side.\n\nSources include:\n\nWND.com\n\nWIONews.com\n\nLiveScience.com\n\nByjus.com\n\nNews.Yahoo.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New study finds cosmic shock wave 60 times larger than the Milky Way\n\nA new study has found a massive shock wave that is many times larger than the Milky Way.\n\nAbell 3667, situated about 730 million light-years from Earth, is a galaxy cluster that is in turmoil. It is made up of two clusters of galaxies that are actually crashing into each other and about 550 individual galaxies in total that are gradually moving into one huge cosmic broth. (Related: Astronomers find 1,000 mysterious filaments of radio energy blasting from center of Milky Way.)\n\nAlthough it is not immediately recognizable to most telescopes, the cosmic collision has made a massive disturbance in the area, causing a gigantic shock wave that blazes out of either side of the fusing cluster and apparent only in radio wavelengths.\n\nA new study released last February 7 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics provides the most accurate picture ever captured of this colossal wave.\n\nRadio relics can be used to investigate galaxy cluster\n\nEmploying the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa, the researchers imaged both halves of the shock wave’s radio component also known as “radio relics” and discovered that the structures are far more complicated than former observations recorded.\n\nThe radio relics can be used to investigate the properties of the intergalactic space within the cluster, which are called the intracluster medium and intracluster dynamics.\n\nAbell 3667, which is relatively close to the Milky Way and also quite large, makes it a superb object 0f such investigation.\n\nConsidering that the cluster is in the southern sky, astronomers were able to watch it with one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world. MeerKAT is a forerunner to and pioneer for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) that is presently being developed across Australia and South Africa to give an exceptional radio eye on the sky.\n\n“These structures are full of surprises and much more complex than what we initially thought. The shock waves act as giant particle accelerators that accelerate electrons to speeds close to the speed of light. When these fast electrons cross a magnetic field, they emit the radio waves that we see,” said lead study author and astronomer Francesco de Gasperin of the University of Hamburg in Germany and the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy\n\n“The shocks are threaded by an intricate pattern of bright filaments that trace the location of giant magnetic field lines and the regions where electrons are accelerated.”\n\nThe shock wave first blasted into being about a billion years ago when the two galaxy clusters that make up Abell 3667 first collided according to the researchers.\n\nGalaxy clusters are the most tremendous gravitational-bound formations in the universe and when two of them combine, they deliver the biggest amount of energy in a single occurrence since the Big Bang the researchers said.\n\nThey can be absolutely enormous, comprising hundreds or thousands of individual galaxies. Galaxies and galaxy clusters journey along threads of the cosmic web to cluster nodes, where they unite to form even bigger clusters.\n\nThese monumental events occur at high speeds, producing cluster-scale shock waves that spread through space also at high speeds.\n\nAbell 3667 is still merging with other galaxies\n\nAbell 3667 is still merging. At least 550 galaxies have already connected with it. The shock waves are spreading through it at speeds around 1,500 kilometers per second (930 miles per second).\n\nAs the wave fires electrons into space at near-lightspeed, the particles ripped through magnetic fields in the area, releasing the twin arcs of radio waves that were seen.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the radio arcs move at more than 5.3 million kilometers per second (3.3 million miles per second) and are about 13 million lightyears apart from each other. The radio arcs each measure 60 times larger than the entire Milky Way galaxy, which stretches about 100,000 light-years in diameter.\n\n“Our observations have unveiled the complexity of the interplay between the thermal and non-thermal components in the most active regions of a merging cluster. Both the intricate internal structure of radio relics and the direct detection of magnetic draping around the merging bullet are powerful examples of the non-trivial magnetic properties of the intracluster medium.\n\nThanks to its sensitivity to polarized radiation, MeerKAT will be transformational in the study of these complex phenomena,” the researchers wrote. And that is one mighty explosion and impressive view for astronomers who are sitting safely across the universe, according to one researcher.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nExperts: Cataclysmic flare in the Milky Way felt 200,000 light-years away.\n\nRadioactive “snowflakes” behave like small nuclear bombs in the universe.\n\nAstronomers find 1,000 mysterious filaments of radio energy blasting from center of Milky Way.\n\nSun erupting non-stop this month, giant explosions seen from its far side.\n\nWatch the video below to know how the stars and galaxies in the universe were created.\n\nThis video is from the Herewego channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFollow Cosmic.news for more articles like this.\n\nSources include:\n\nLiveScience.com\n\nScienceAlert.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

What do you notice?\n\nShock horror! It’s in the peak of winter when mortality is always at its highest and, wait for it, at a time when less than 5% of the population were vaccinated.\n\nFrom march onwards, the numbers decline as the unvaccinated proportion of the population decreases and winter subsides into summer.\n\nIn fact, the vaccinated begin to rise above the unvaccinated.\n\nBut undeniably, yes, the double jabbed death rate does appear to be significantly lower from COVID-19 related deaths.\n\nBut here’s the thing, there have been more deaths following vaccination reported via the UK’s vaccine injury reporting system since the middle of March through to the beginning of March than there has of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated in the same timeframe.\n\nThe UK Column has created an improved frontend for the Governments Yellow Card reporting system HERE[5].\n\nYou can find the full data from the Office of National Statistics showing deaths by vaccine status HERE[6]"

        "These include heavier than usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after all three Covid vaccines, out of more than 47 million doses given to women in the UK to date.- BBC News[1]\n\nDid you notice the misleading data included in that statement?\n\n’47 million doses given to women in the UK to date’ – So what are we discussing here, menstrual cycles. Right, so how many of this 47 million doses were given to post-menopausal women. Well, we have around 12.5 million women between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nI’ve used this age range because young women commonly have menstrual cycle issues due to developing hormones, birth control and lifestyle and 50 is the average age of menopause.\n\nThis brings the number down to around 12 million. Now we have to reduce this further based on vaccination status. This is more tricky to determine if we are to believe the commonly touted percentage of 80% this brings the amount down to 9.6 million.\n\nEarly menopause occurs in amount 5% of women under 45[2], so we can reduce this number to 9.1 million.\n\nPolycystic ovaries effects 10% of the population[3] and so this brings the number down further to around 8.2 million. Of course, we can reduce this number further if we had the data, but since this is quite a crude calculation anyway, we’ll leave it there in ‘their’ favour.\n\nNow consider the fact that 30,000 reports do not equate to 30,000 actual incidences of menstrual irregularity. As you well know, studies on the VAERs reporting system found that as little as 1% of adverse events were reported. When it comes to menstrual irregularities, this number could be even less considering the perceived seriousness of it.\n\nBut for argument’s sake let us assume 5% have been reported. This would bring the total number of incidences to 2.8 million.\n\nThat’s an incidence rate of 34%.\n\nNow I know, these calculations are crude, however the error on my part I have tried to leave to the downside of the final value, but you see my point and you see how the statements made by the BBC are intentionally deceptive.\n\nBut Don’t Worry – It Doesn’t matter anyway!\n\nThat’s right, even if a link is found, it doesn’t matter. You can just prepare, as Dr. Male says:\n\n“If a link between vaccination and menstrual changes is confirmed, this information will allow people to plan for potentially altered cycles,” BBC News[1]\n\nAll links to potential fertility issues are then stated as being ‘misinformation’ and ‘false’.\n\nNo mention of the study released to the public[4] via a freedom of information act request from Japanese health authorities which shows the lipid concentration in various parts of the body following vaccination.\n\nThe lipid nanoparticles called ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 which travel with the spike protein, we found to accumulate in the ovaries within fifteen minutes of vaccination. But more concerning is that the nanoparticle accumulation showed a linear increase in the ovaries through the end of the study’s duration window of 48 hours."

        "The ongoing so-called ‘pandemic’ has hit everyone hard, no one has escaped the grip of the tyrannical reaction from Governments around the World, but there is a group of the population which is suffering in silence, in plain view, this group are the future of human society and parents are unknowingly through their own ignorance, destroying them both physically and mentally.\n\nLet’s talk about the Children.\n\nAnother Brick in The Wall\n\nWitnessing children going to school was a shocking sight to behold, as the bused loaded with fully masked children parked up outside the school gates, children were ushered off the bus by a team of teachers who ensured social distancing was achieved as the children made their way to their new pandemic modified classrooms.\n\nWith all over 12-year-olds now expected to wear Face Masks throughout the day, social distancing maintained where possible and the constant reminder of the big bad scary COVID-19 lurking around every corner; School is quite the little house of horrors.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. Parents are shamefully allowing their children, and likely encouraging them either directly or indirectly to wear face masks out in public, when shopping or at the park.\n\nVirtue Signalling\n\nWhile shopping the other day at my local supermarket, I witnessed multiple parents with children as young as 5 fully masked, in one case they had matching pink face masks. Ugggh!\n\nUsing your children as part of your ridiculous virtue signalling games is disgusting.\n\nUnder any other circumstances, this unquestionably would be considered as ‘Child Abuse’. Covering a child’s airways and thus restricting airflow to the child’s lungs is clearly an issue. Where are those lovely child-snatchers over at social services now?\n\nBut the physical abuse is just a very small part of the problem. It is the ongoing psychological abuse on children that really is at a scale never witnessed before.\n\nFear is the Mind Killer\n\nFor over a year, children have been placed in a perpetual state of fear, the fear of the killer bug, the fear for their own lives, but even more so, the fear of killing those they love – their parents, their grandparents.\n\n“Stay Safe!”. When people I deal with say this to me in closing our conversation I want to scream.\n\nIt’s everywhere, from billboards to motorway information displays. Everywhere I go, “Stay Safe”, “Stay Safe!”, “Stay Safe!”. Please enough, if it makes me feel like I’m loosing my sanity, god only knows how young children are feeling right now.\n\nFilthy Little Rats!\n\nWe live in unprecedented times, a time where social division is promoted and human contact is condemned.\n\nFor the first time in history, a child is now made to feel guilty for cuddling up to their parents, a time when a hug is needed more than ever.\n\nBritons should not hug their children even once they’ve been vaccinated, an expert has stressed – The Evening Standard[1]\n\nAnd keep away from your much loved Grandparents, don’t touch them – you might kill them:\n\nGrandparents who have received the Covid vaccine should not yet hug their families, a professor has warned, amid fears that those who have had the jab will abandon the lockdown rules. – The Telegraph[2]\n\n“Keep those filthy little child hands to yourself, you are a potentially deadly weapon and you wouldn’t want to kill your own loved ones, would you? Stay Safe!”\n\nMental Abuse\n\nI cannot begin to imagine how all this feels for children right now, but new data is emerging and it doesn’t look pretty.\n\nDr. Richard Delorme heads the psychiatric department at one of the largest children’s hospitals in France and what he is seeing is devastating:\n\n“We are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old,” Delorme said. “We sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it’s not simply aprovocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives.” –AP News[3]\n\nDepression in children grew exponentially just through the UK’s first lockdown:\n\n“To give an indication of how large this effect is, imagine ranking the children into 100 ‘centiles’ depending on their scores,” explained Dr Duncan Astle from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and senior author of the study. “A child in the 50th centile would be exactly at the middle of the distribution. But a child at this position before the pandemic, could expect to be at the equivalent of the 77th centile during the lockdown. “Put differently, if you randomly selected a child from the sample there is a 70% chance that their depression symptoms were worse during lockdown than before the pandemic.” – University of Cambridge[4]\n\nThat was the observation of children just after a few months of the pandemic. What are the effects a year on?\n\nIgnorance is Bliss\n\nIn many cases parents play a large part of this abuse, by participating in this pandemic fiasco, reinforcing the lies and fears presented by the Government and media, they are validating fear and confusion in their children.\n\nIt’s disgusting and unforgiveable. There is no excuse for lack of research and critical thinking, particularly when this neglect to one’s own knowledge results in the abuse of your own children.\n\nParents who pander to these false fears in front of their children should be shamed, they should be held accountable. Not by Government, they’ve done quite enough damage, but by society.\n\nGood is Bad; Black is White\n\nBut in this topsy-turvy World it is I that is shamed; shamed for taking my children out shopping; shamed for failing to sanitize my children’s hands and my own at every entry and exit point; failure to wear a mask or prevent my children from running around like lunatics as if there was nothing to fear.\n\nWe are the lepers, the freaks, the odd ones out. We who have ensured our children remain free, happy and emotionally satisfied both mentally and physically. We are the parents of concern, simply for loving our children first and foremost.\n\nTake this piece from the teen propaganda publication Teen Vogue entitled ‘Young People on Holiday Risks With Parents Who Ignore COVID-19 Restrictions'[5] for example:\n\nSelena’s mom hasn’t tempered her activities because of COVID-19restrictions — she’s still going on out-of-town trips and gambling in casinos. Selena’s aunt, a nurse, doesn’t wear her mask dependably. She says her mother’s side of the family doesn’t know anyone who has gotten sick or died from COVID, so it’s easy for them to pretend it isn’t real. Plus, she says, they don’t listen to reliable news sources — “some of them still claim that the election was a fraud, so it’s one of those situations.” – Teen Vogue[5]\n\nThis shameful piece of propaganda continues to vilify the parents while validating and indeed amplifying children’s fears using unconfirmed science:\n\nBut there are now reports of people contracting the virus twice, suggesting immunity may not last. Teen Vogue[5]\n\nIt is true that there are cases of people contracting the virus twice, but we are talking about a small handful of cases from the millions that have contracted the virus. The article intentionally fails to elaborate on this topic, they simply make the statement that you can catch it twice, and leave it there.\n\nThis article is just one of thousands designed to turn children against their parents. Its psychological warfare against your children, you and the family unit as a whole.\n\nPlease, I urge you, no matter what your views on the pandemic are, please put your children first, second and third. There is nothing more important in this world than our children, they are our future, our legacy.\n\nPlease leave your comments below."

        "What is the best way to convince the general public into taking an experimental vaccine which has limited safety and efficacy trials?\n\nOf course, you use actors and other performance artists to convince them. Most people do not want the science or data to hand when making important decisions like this, but give them a familiar face from the little box in the room, telling them to be good little girls and boys and hey presto, informed consent complete!\n\nBefore I get into these so-called celebrities who have sold their souls to the devil, I’d like to point out the fact that the NHS & the British media warned the public that this was exactly how they were going to convince the public into being human guinea pigs back in November of 2020:\n\nNHS bosses plan to enlist celebrities and “influencers” with big social media followings in a major campaign to persuade people to have a Covid vaccine amid fears of low take-up. Ministers and NHS England are drawing up a list of “very sensible” famous faces in the hope that their advice to get immunised would be widely trusted, the Guardian has learned. – The Guardian[1]\n\nThis tactic however is nothing new, some of you may remember singer and full-time drug addict Elvis Presley taking the Polio Vaccine on national television in 1956, which led to a staggering 90% vaccine uptake in no time![2]\n\nOne can only assume that finding ‘very sensible’ celebrities willing to place the general population into a position of potential harm proved harder than expected.\n\nFirst up, Elton John:"

        "Just a year ago if you asked anyone if they would like an experimental vaccine that has only been in trials for a few months, has no significant safety data, negligible efficacy data and 80% of test subjects had moderate to high adverse effects, to help protect against a disease which effects only a small fraction of society, specifically the old and vulnerable, all but the clinically insane would have told you where to go.\n\nHow times have changed. So what happened?\n\nThe Year of Fear\n\nFear is an important human response, it is an emotion with one goal in mind, saving your ass.\n\nFear facilitates adaptation and constitutes a survival and defense mechanism that developed so that individuals could respond to adverse situations quickly and efficiently. In that sense, fear is a normal and beneficial emotion, not just for individual survival but also for the entire human species. Fear is considered “normal” when its intensity corresponds to the seriousness of the threat. In other words, the object of fear has characteristics that could threaten a person’s life. – Exploring Your Mind[1]\n\nBut sadly, as with all human emotions, it can be easily exploited.\n\n2020 saw the greatest exploitation of the human fear emotion the World has ever seen. From the early days in Wuhan where we saw people dropping to the floor in pools of blood, to the piles of bodies outside of hospitals and what about those insane prediction models coming out of the Imperial College!\n\nThe facts surrounding the events are unimportant, or at least they have been to the Government and media. What is important is that it generates fear in the population.\n\nFear has been the main driver of this pandemic, it has been the very lifeblood of this pandemic. The actual facts just wouldn’t have been enough to ensure compliance. We needed all-out psychological warfare to keep this baby going.\n\nOver the past year we have seen people become fearful of the very environment they live in and the people that inhabit it, all thanks to the response to this pandemic.\n\nPeople are so scared of the virus that they would choose to neglect someone in need, even a family member, because their fear overshadowed their love.\n\nOur Lord & Saviour, the Vaccine\n\nWith running commentary all the way back from the beginning about how the only way out of this pandemic was with ‘a vaccine’, is it any wonder this COVID-19 vaccine has developed something of god-like status?\n\nFirst of all, we were told it was our saviour, our only hope. But then we were left hanging with comments from many experts saying “A vaccine before the end of 2021 is unlikely”.\n\nThe vaccine-carrot has been just off in the distance, out of reach, every step of the way. But then, hallelujah, we were seeing promise of a vaccine by Christmas!\n\nBy the New Year we had a choice, we had the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna Vaccine. People had a choice, people could drool over the one they thought was the best. But hang on, you might have to wait?!\n\nWait in Line\n\nHow exciting it must be to get that letter through the post, much like Charlie receiving his golden ticket to Wonker’s Chocolate factory, the feeling I’m sure is something else. ‘I was chosen, it’s my turn and I beat you to it!’\n\nBrilliant indeed. How else were they going to convince an entire nation to be the phase three clinical trials of a new experimental vaccine using new technology with absolutely no long-term studies, in fact nothing exceeding just a few months?\n\nMy hat goes off to them. They did good.\n\nWait, there are shortages, we might have to delay the second dose to ensure others can get their first dose?!\n\n….chief executive of NHS England, said there is a global “supply shortage” of the vaccines, as manufacturers struggle to keep up with demand. – Sky News[2]\n\nThis type of narrative is all we have heard since even before the vaccines were being manufactured on mass. Leaders around the World were fighting over who had how many, and when – it has been like watching a soap opera, with a terrible cast and an equally terrible script.\n\nBut it works. This sense of missing out, or FOMO(fear of missing out) really does do the trick regarding demand. When people fear they might be unable to have something offered, they want it even more – it’s human instinct.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is how you get an entire population scrabbling over an experimental vaccine.\n\nStay Informed\n\nAll I ask of anyone, is that they do their own research and due diligence, your initial thoughts maybe that this decision is a no-brainer – ‘of course I’ll have the vaccine’. But this lack of thought is the result of the biased information you have been subjected too. It really isn’t as simple as that.\n\nPeople are dying from the vaccine, people are getting severely injured from the vaccine, as they do with all vaccines. The difference this time is that we do not know what we are dealing with, this time we have literally just a few months of trial data to rely on (all of which is still unreleased by the pharmaceutical companies, so much for their pledge for transparency[3]).\n\nExperts are surprised by the high frequency of adverse effects, countries like Norway have experienced dozens of deaths following vaccination of their elderly. And while health officials and the media may shrug all these issues off as ‘coincidence’, can we really be sure they are?\n\nHere is the real question you need to ask yourself:\n\nWhat is the risk to benefit ratio?\n\nIf you are under 75 and relatively healthy, there is no point in taking this vaccine, it can offer you nothing your immune system can do better.\n\nIf you are over 75, and/or have health issues, do you think your immune system is ready for the vaccine? Baring in mind the high rate of adverse effects from the shot.\n\nI understand it’s a tough decision for many, the vaccine may feel like an antidote for the perpetual fear you have been going through – but just know this, all the data on mortality over the past year shows nothing particularly significant is occurring.\n\nExcess deaths are up marginally, but we’ve had worse in the past decade.\n\nEverything we hear about the hospitals being overrun, bodies piling up in the streets – it’s all due to the reaction and not the problem.\n\nIf you put 40+% of your perfectly healthy medical staff into self-isolation due to a testing system that has been proven to be flawed, you can expect to see hospitals fall into chaos.\n\nIf you reduce your hospital beds every year by 10% for decades (as they have been here in the UK), then you can expect trouble sooner or later.\n\nIf you have more 85 and above year olds than ever before in the population, then isolate them, throw a few COVID infected patients in with them – reduce the number of people to look after them – Well, expect a lot of them to die.\n\nThere are a million and one reasons why the excess deaths are marginally higher over the past 12 months, and all of them have very little to do with a deadly virus."

        "NHS Nurse Tracey McCallum faces losing her career of more than 20 years after sharing he views on the pandemic on social media.\n\nThe media are claiming McCallum has been spreading ‘conspiracy theories’ online about the pandemic after doing ‘her own research online’, but in reality all she has done is shared a different opinion on current events.\n\nShe is being accused of the following:\n\nClaiming face masks are helping spread the virus\n\nThis is something which even the studies raise concerns over, while face masks appear to make a small difference in a medical environment where strict protocols are adhered too, in the general population they may indeed do more harm than good.\n\nEven Good Morning Britains Dr. Hillary stated:\n\nIt can do harm if you do wear a mask, you adjust it, it gets itchy and moist – which means you are putting your hand to your face more often. If the mask gets moist, it traps the virus. – Metro[1]\n\nWhile McCallum said there was evidence that masks were a:\n\n“breeding ground for bacteria and viruses”\n\nHas Dr Hillary been suspended then, because she has basically repeated verbatum what this well respected TV Doctor publically stated on national television?\n\nTo date, there is no real evidence to back up the claims that a Face Mask will prevent the transmission of the virus within the general population, it’s purely a matter of opinion.\n\nOpenly slamming the new vaccine comparing it to “genocide”\n\nTracey McCallum has also opened fire on the new COVID-19 vaccines, she has publically compared them to ‘genocide’. Of course they have yet to be released onto the general public, so no genocide has occurred…..yet.\n\nWhen asked about her comments, she responded:\n\n“What I was meaning was that nurses were fooled in the war, through the Holocaust, into giving people medication. There have been a lot of bad side effects. I know a lot of nurses who don’t want to take it and I think ‘if you don’t want to take it then why give it to someone else?’”\n\nIs this a Conspiracy Theory, no, it’s an opinion based on real concerns. All the COVID-19 vaccines are being designed, produced, trialed and then mass produced all within a few months.\n\nThe safety trials haven’t shown huge promise, and clearly even the UK Government are expecting major problems when the vaccine finally does hit the publics bloodstreams:\n\nThe MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) – OYE NEWS[2]\n\nBacking hydroxychloroquine taken by Donald Trump but dismissed by world health chiefs\n\nHydroxychloroquine may indeed have been dismissed by ‘World Health Chiefs’, but these so called chiefs are not leaders in the field of medicine. HCQ has clear benefits to treat COVID-19, I reported on this numerous times.\n\nBut whether due to political reasons or something else, Government, Mainstream media and Big Tech have all censored anyone who promotes HCQ for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nRemember the Frontline Doctors who were wiped out of existence after sharing this:"

In truth, Ebola tests won't show positive results until the virus incubated in the body for a period of up to 42 days.\n\nNigeria has remained Ebola-free thanks to quarantines, travel restrictions and border security.

        "Nonprofit founded by CNN co-founder was PREPARING for the monkeypox outbreak in 2021\n\nThe Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) was preparing for the monkeypox outbreak as early as March 2021, when it conducted a tabletop exercise simulating its spread through the United States.\n\nThe NTI is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization founded in 2001 by former Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn and media billionaire and CNN co-founder Ted Turner.\n\nThe NTI partnered with the Munich Security Conference (MSC), a nonprofit that holds a yearly conference on international security policy in Germany, during last year’s virtual exercise, held on March 17. The NTI and MSC summarized their key findings and actionable recommendations in the tabletop exercise and released this report back in November. (Related: Monkeypox outbreak could be used to justify expansion of medical surveillance.)\n\nTo aid the NTI in its simulation, it gathered a panel of 19 experts, including representatives of the American and Chinese governments, officials from the World Health Organization and the United Nations and researchers from Big Pharma companies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This simulation was also sponsored by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his charity organization, Open Philanthropy.\n\nNTI simulates release of “lab-enhanced” monkeypox virus\n\nThe fictional scenario was meant to simulate a bioterror attack similar to what happened in the 1995 movie “12 Monkeys,” wherein a group of eco-terrorists released a deadly virus that wiped out most of humanity.\n\nThe NTI’s scenario gamed out what would happen if a lab-enhanced monkeypox virus was secretly released and ended up spreading worldwide during a 19-month-long pandemic.\n\nThe simulation’s imaginary launch date was May 15, with cases beginning to emerge a month later, resulting in more than three billion infections and 271 million deaths by the end of the exercise.\n\nIt should be noted that the simulation’s launch date coincides with the start of the first international outbreak of monkeypox, which currently has around 1,000 confirmed or suspected cases across at least 40 countries, including the United States, which has 45 confirmed cases in 15 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nNTI denies it predicted monkeypox outbreak\n\nThe NTI’s decision to use monkeypox for its fictional scenario, along with the timeline it used, has led many to speculate whether the nonprofit predicted the current monkeypox outbreak.\n\nNTI immediately denied all of the accusations leveled against the organization in statements released on the group’s website and in interviews given by its leading members. It has gone so far as to accuse many of its detractors of spreading disinformation.\n\n“Some social media activities have included disinformation about our exercise,” wrote the group on its website. “The key takeaway from our exercise is not the specific pathogen in our fictional scenario; it’s the fact that the world is woefully unprepared to guard against future pandemics.”\n\n“We wanted to select a pathogen that would be a plausible fit for our fictional scenario, and we chose monkeypox from a range of options offered by our expert advisors,” said NTI Vice President of Global Biological Policy and Programs Jaime Yassif. “The fact that several countries are currently experiencing an outbreak of monkeypox is purely a coincidence.”\n\nLearn more about the monkeypox outbreak by reading the latest articles at Outbreak.news.\n\nWatch this clip from “The Stew Peters Show” and learn more about the Nuclear Threat Initiative and its preparations for the monkeypox outbreak.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWHO says monkeypox outbreak unlikely to turn into next global pandemic.\n\nDespite media claims, Americans shouldn’t be concerned about monkeypox – Brighteon.TV.\n\nWhy did the government buy 13 million monkeypox vaccines from a biotech company backed by Fauci?\n\nRIGGED: Government spends $119 million for monkeypox vaccines following ONE confirmed case in US.\n\nNew engineered pandemic: US buys millions of vaccines as monkeypox outbreak hits Europe and North America.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nNYPost.com\n\nNewsweek.com\n\nWSJ.com\n\nNTI.org\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "CNN now publicly asking whether mRNA injections have CAUSED the current covid wave – exactly as we’ve been saying since day one\n\nPigs might be about to fly now that fake news giant CNN is admitting, in a surprising turn of events, that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” may actually be causing the constant and continual waves of covid infection that are being reported all around the world.\n\nAfter denying, denying, and denying some more that the jabs are doing anything other than “saving lives,” CNN is beginning to question the legitimacy of the baseless government claim that Fauci Flu shots are “safe and effective.”\n\nAccording to CNN, scientists are “urgently trying to solve … another piece of the immunity puzzle” concerning mRNA (messenger RNA) technology and its apparent propensity for making things worse rather than better as far as public health is concerned. (Related: One of the ways the jabs are making this worse is by giving people AIDS.)\n\nCNN speculates that the “drop off in our protection” against the Chinese Virus might be the result of the mRNA injections from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, “which were the first in the world to use this platform.”\n\nTony Fauci has decided to chime in as well, but in a much more deceitful way, of course. He says that “we got a really great platform with mRNA,” but that we need to “try to be better” with it because this version of it is not exactly producing the health outcomes he long promised.\n\n“The United States is at a point in the pandemic now where health officials are grappling with the fact that to maintain immunity against Covid-19 in the community, the nation will either need to administer booster shots on a regular – or possibly annual – basis, or will need to rollout [sic] an entirely new vaccine altogether,” CNN now admits.\n\nUh, oh: that certainly does not sound good or promising. We went from the jabs supposedly providing a pathway out of the plandemic to the jabs now keeping the plandemic going possibly forever when it otherwise would have ended by now.\n\n“What you’re seeing here is the first steps toward an official acknowledgement that the mRNA vaccines have failed and new vaccines are coming sooner or later,” writes Alex Berenson on his Substack.\n\nHow many more injections will people take before they realize the government has been lying to them the entire time?\n\nSince so few people are taking the so-called “booster” shots still being pushed by the Biden regime, that program will likely fall by the wayside and disappear in the coming months, only to be replaced by something else.\n\nThe White House will likely claim that “mRNA vaccine hesitancy has risen to unsustainable levels,” Berenson suggests. This will be followed by the introduction of a “new” jab technology that more than likely has already been waiting in the wings for years to be introduced when the time is just right.\n\n“They may even be cynical enough to blame those of us who were right all along for said hesitancy,” Berenson writes.\n\n“The great mRNA experiment will come to an end, not with a bang but with 200 million expired doses in freezers. The most likely but by no means certain outcome is: zero long-term benefit, zero to some long-term harm, and $100 billion-plus for Pfizer and the gang.”\n\nThese repeated attempts by the powers that be to play God keep failing and they always will fail. Unfortunately, millions of people have yet to wake up to the scam and will likely continue to take whatever the government rolls out next as the solution to the problem it created with its previous solution.\n\nJust as a reminder: Natural News has been warning about all of this since day one. We told our readers to beware of the jabs, especially the ones created using mRNA because the technology has never before been used in a human application – and perhaps more importantly, it has never been successfully used in any application, animal or otherwise.\n\nThe whole thing is a dangerous scam, and the reality of this is even now being admitted, albeit in a roundabout way, by the likes of CNN.\n\n“The harm is monstrous all over the globe,” wrote a commenter at Berenson’s Substack. “Immune systems are now seriously compromised. Every major scientist who warned about this was banned.”\n\n“Geert Vanden Bossche was one, Yeadon, Montagnier, McCullough, more. Pfizer knew. Naomi Wolf found the empty brackets for a total of 6 boosters. Pfizer knew this was a ‘leaky injection.'”\n\nSomeone else responded to this person by explaining how she has so many “formerly healthy girlfriends” in their 40s who are now complaining about constant headaches and gut issues.\n\n“None of them connect it to 3 bouts of spike protein via vaccines and having a bad case of covid,” this person added. “I am there to ask them though they find my question distasteful.”\n\nMore news coverage about the failed plandemic injections can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nAlexBerenson.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "PAYOLA PROPAGANDA: Government pays hundreds of media companies to advertise COVID vax as those same outlets provide all-positive coverage of the jabs\n\nCapitalism is considered by many as the best economic system in the world, but morality is key to make it work for the betterment of the general public.\n\nWhen there is a natural disaster, business owners should not raise prices on goods like water and food that people need most. Companies should pay their workers to the best of their abilities while still earning profits rather than exploiting them for maximum economic gain. If there are conflicts of interest arising from business arrangements, then companies should say so.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nRegarding that last point, the federal government paid hundreds of media companies to advertise the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines while at the same time they were only providing glowingly positive stories and reviews of said vaccines – never once bothering to reveal their huge financial interest in doing so, as The Blaze first reported last week:\n\n“HHS revealed that it purchased advertising from major news networks including ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as cable TV news stations Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, legacy media publications including the New York Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post, digital media companies like BuzzFeed News and Newsmax, and hundreds of local newspapers and TV stations. These outlets were collectively responsible for publishing countless articles and video segments regarding the vaccine that were nearly uniformly positive about the vaccine in terms of both its efficacy and safety,” reported TheBlaze.\n\n“Hundreds of news organizations were paid by the federal government to advertise for the vaccines as part of a ‘comprehensive media campaign,’ according to documents TheBlaze obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Biden administration purchased ads on TV, radio, in print, and on social media to build vaccine confidence, timing this effort with the increasing availability of the vaccines. The government also relied on earned media featuring ‘influencers’ from ‘communities hit hard by COVID-19’ and ‘experts’ like White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and other academics to be interviewed and promote vaccination in the news.”\n\nMainstream media turns into propaganda machine\n\nTheBlaze further noted that despite the fact that nearly all of those news outlets produced stories that covered and explained COVID-19 vaccines, the fact that taxpayer dollars were flowing into them was never disclosed in those reports.\n\nThat’s disturbing because it has been common practice for a century that newsrooms and editorial content production divisions operate independently of advertising departments. “News teams felt no need to make the disclosure, as some publications reached for comment explained,” TheBlaze reported.\n\nWhile the vaccines were developed under then-President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed,” it was the Biden administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress that engaged in and funded the massive ad campaign to “educate the public” and push vaccines as the only way forward through the pandemic.\n\nSpecifically, Congress appropriated $1 billion in the last fiscal year (2021) for the HHS secretary to spend on measures to “strengthen vaccine confidence in the United States.” Federal law authorized the department to act through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and for other federal departments to hand out contracts to both public and private entities so they could “carry out a national, evidence-based campaign to increase awareness and knowledge of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for the prevention and control of diseases, combat misinformation about vaccines and disseminate scientific and evidence-based vaccine-related information, with the goal of increasing rates of vaccination across all ages to reduce and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases,” the law notes.\n\n“Advertisers pay for space to share their messages, as was the case here, and those ads are clearly labeled as such,” explained Shani George, vice president of communications for the Washington Post, in a statement.\n\n“The newsroom is completely independent from the advertising department,” she claimed, unbelievably.\n\nDitto for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe fact is, the WaPo, the LA Times, the New York Times and the other major left-wing news networks were all leading propagandists for the vaccines. And all of them either censored or attacked anyone who espoused differing views on the efficacy of vaccines or touted different, effective treatments.\n\nCapitalism is the best economic system on the planet, as American-style republicanism is the best form of government. But both require moral people to work properly.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheBlaze.com\n\nNewsFakes.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "All the ‘experts’ were wrong on COVID. Now they’re forced to admit it\n\nCountries around the world are signaling they are “done with COVID.”\n\n(Article by Kennedy Hall republished from LifeSiteNews.com)\n\nLike asylum patients who have finally been taken off their sedatives and allowed to think for themselves, even the most zealous lockdown maniacs — like Ontario’s Doug Ford — have come alive and are singing a new tune about “moving on,” and seem to have a little more pep in their step.\n\nPremier of Ontario Doug Ford admits that the Vaccine Passport Program was a massive failure. Ends it.pic.twitter.com/JeMr82u7Le — Keean Bexte (@TheRealKeean) February 15, 2022\n\nAll of the sudden, natural immunity, human rights, the rights of children to breathe fresh air, and a whole host of other sane ideas are the new normal.\n\nIt is fascinating, even if a bit surprising. However, the change is welcome — even if the leaders are disingenuous in their change. But we mustn’t let our guards down and miss the subtle truth-bombs that they are now letting come to light.\n\nNo matter how many pounds of dirt they attempt to bury on the truth of what has happened, even the most zealous of COVID zero maniacs cannot keep the truth hidden forever.\n\nSure, they can certainly obfuscate the narrative through fear-invoking propaganda, which they have done quite successfully. However, as time passes, it becomes more evident to more people each day that many of the claims of the COVID crowd have either never come true, or the opposite has turned out to be true.\n\nAnd now it is clear that literally nothing the “experts” have done has worked at all.\n\nNew Zealand didn’t ‘beat COVID’ after all\n\nFor example, New Zealand was touted as the champion of COVID in those early days of the two weeks to end all plagues. They had “beaten” COVID, experts told us, because of all the obedient and selfless lockdown-loving Jacinda Ardern disciples.\n\nWell, of course they hadn’t “beaten COVID” because you can’t “beat” a virus anymore than you can beat biology. So, they had a smattering of itty-bitty lockdowns where everyone went home for a few days, and they “beat” COVID again and again.\n\nThen the dictatrix of the land of the Haka threatened to basically have every man, woman, and child either locked in the island forever or fired unless they got jabbed. And then, with most of the mammals on the island vaxxed to the max … the nation went from locking down over a single case, to having tens of thousands of positive cases each and every day.\n\nCOVID zealots will point to New Zealand’s very low overall death tally, but those same zealots are curiously silent on sub-Saharan African nations who have faired better than most Western nations with virtually none of the same resources or mitigation measures.\n\nIt seems that New Zealand did not beat COVID, and it turns out New Zealanders are a bit mad they have been locked down over and over only to find themselves in this position. I wonder if the Kiwis are still keen on trusting the “experts.”\n\n?

(@Rudio1John) February 20, 2022\n\nInflated egos can’t hide inflated stats\n\nAnthony Fauci famously alluded that he was in fact “the science,” demonstrating the most absurd heights of the ego needed for being a virus czar.\n\nThink about it, it takes a special sort of person to stand in front of a nation or province for two years and speak as if you are inspired by divine fiat that has informed you of the absolute state of health of millions of people.\n\nWell, an inflated ego cannot keep hidden the fact that the deaths reported to be associated with COVID were in fact inflated.\n\nOn Wednesday, while telling citizens they could now enter a store without muzzling themselves, Ontario let it slip that upwards of 30 percent of the reported COVID deaths were not actually from COVID.\n\nNow, against our better judgement, let us assume that the government is telling the truth, and that only 30 per cent of deaths have been wrongly reported.\n\nIn two years, Ontario has reported 12,618 supposed COVID deaths. With the admission from public health that almost a third were a mix up, that means almost four thousand weren’t actually COVID deaths.\n\nThere is no reason to assume that this trend hasn’t been seen or won’t be noticed in other places. In a nation like the U.S., that could mean hundreds of thousands of deaths were wrongly tallied. The word “fraud” cannot encompass how fraudulent that is.\n\nIn addition, the Ontario government did not announce the news of fraud alongside the news of unmasking, but instead had the damning info slipped into a report that no one will read.\n\nAs a way of helping their fellow comrades out in this charade, the mainstream news buried the info at the bottom of articles well beyond the headline where most dare not venture.\n\nYou have to ask yourself: Why did they even admit it at all?\n\nWell, that is the funny thing about truth, it likes to be set free, and you can’t suppress it forever.\n\nNatural immunity is no longer a conspiracy theory\n\nPerhaps you heard of those lunatics back in 2020 who were going on about some mythological idea called “natural immunity.”\n\nThese COVID heretics appealed to all of human history and the accumulation of hundreds of years of scientific discussion in an attempt to have the public believe that people could actually become immune to a virus by coming into contact with it. I know, crazy, right?\n\nWell, it turns out that natural immunity is a thing, and that it isn’t a conspiracy theory.\n\nThe problem for the COVID leaders is that they denied it existed for so long, so how can they bring themselves to admit it?\n\nOntario’s Dr. Moore gave a masterful display on how to reveal a truth heretofore suppressed like he was doing something so mundane as reading the daily specials off a menu.\n\nOntario’s Chief Medical Officer announces the end of mask mandates in most settings, while also confirming that masks will return if a new variant surfaces. MORE: https://t.co/u6LA4nR4Z3 pic.twitter.com/FNXrhhNJWr — Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) March 9, 2022\n\n“Thanks to our high vaccination rates and natural immunity … as well as the arrival of other therapeutics …”\n\nHold on, did he just admit that natural immunity was real? What did he mean by therapeutics? He wouldn’t dare suggest there was another way to deal with a virus than by wearing a used cloth mask or an experimental jab, would he?\n\nNow, a covidian would explain away the new virus-revelation by saying achieving natural immunity is a more achievable goal because the overhyped omicron is not so severe. Even if that were the case, immunity does not depend on whether or not you feel better or worse while sick.\n\nMillions of Ontarians and people in other regions have been diagnosed with COVID, and therefore they would be immune as well. But, what do I know? I am not an “expert.”\n\nIt is said that the truth shall set you free.\n\nWell, perhaps we can be free of the liars who did their best to hide the truth for so long — that would be a start.\n\nRead more at: LifeSiteNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "CCP plant “Wuhan Wen” now agrees with “anti-science” Americans and admits that Covid masks and lockdowns RUIN children’s cognitive and motor development\n\n“Closing educational disparities” is now at the top of the list of advice coming from the mouth of CNN crisis actor Dr. Leana “Wuhan Wen.” “The science has changed,” Wen declares in order to back up her new anti-science narrative. Straight out of communist China, Wen came to America to tell us all to wear masks indefinitely to protect the world from the China flu, then she said the masks only work in one direction, which she termed “one way masking,” claiming the masks only protect the mask wearer, but nobody else (you really can’t make this stuff up, unless you’re her).\n\nNow “Wuhan Wen” is saying take off those darned masks, because they interfere with cognitive and motor development, especially for children. Has she been wearing her own mask too long to understand that nothing she has said before this, for TWO YEARS, was based on science? Yes, masks are absolutely HORRIFIC for your health all around, restricting oxygen flow by as much as 20 percent all day, obstructing oxygen and nutrient flow to all parts of the body, and THAT IS based on science.\n\nSo are all the previous “anti-science” Americans redeemed, and will all those banned from social media be reinstated? Where are the apologies? If the science simply changes when the wind blows in a new direction, then remove every vaccine and mask mandate across the globe right now.\n\nCrisis actor Dr. Wen now saying what Truth Media has been screaming for 2 years, which was all censored as “anti-science”\n\nWuhan Wen, CNN’s favorite China Flu talking head, now says it’s the “right time to lift mask mandates,” based on nothing scientific, but rather hinged completely on the New York Times editorial board opinion of the situation. (Democrats need to get ready for mid-terms so they’re acting like they care about people’s human rights and medical choice.)\n\nAfter several in-depth studies and lots of research revealing that school closures and masking are destroying children’s cognitive and motor development, including preschoolers, the scamdemic, control-tripping mask and vaccine fanatics are now pulling back, trying to save face so they don’t ALL get voted out of office or put in jail for lying about deadly vaccines and slow-kill-suffocation, bacteria-breeding masks.\n\nIn fact, most of the kids that showed the most pronounced learning LOSS were the youngest ones who suffered not only from school closures, but from suffocating masks when they did attend school. It’s a double-edged sword, these China flu mandates, and the talking heads at CNN lie through their teeth to push the deadly propaganda.\n\nWen pushes her made-up theory “one way masking” on Americans just before saying kids shouldn’t wear them anymore\n\nNow even the far-Left, pro-scamdemic New York Times (NYT) admits it – that mask requirements are a huge mistake for everyone, especially kids. This comes just a couple weeks after crisis actor Dr. Wen made up the “one way masking” conspiracy theory that masks only protect the mask wearer. Now NYT admits it all, saying “…this is the right time to lift the requirement for masks in schools. It’s a lot to ask young children to wear masks for several hours a day, especially when so many adults seem to struggle with it.”\n\nYet, just a few weeks back, Dr. Wen shared her “expert advice” about how the microscopic virus particles cannot penetrate the bandana of the mask wearer going INTO their mouth, but still have no problem coming OUT of their mouth and escaping their cotton-rigged or strap-on polyester face apparatus.\n\nDr. Wen thinks we’re all suffering from amnesia, like her. It just goes to show you that you should never listen to crisis actor advice. Stay tuned and stay frosty. Tune your internet to Censored.news for huge swaths of truth news that’s being censored from the rest of media as you read this.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nCitizenFreePress.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nCensored.news\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "COVID COMMUNISM: CNN lead propagandist, “doctor” Leana Wen, says unvaccinated people should NOT be allowed to travel in US from state to state (op-ed)\n\n(Op-ed) It’s a privilege to travel in the US, says CNN’s favorite communist doctor. You have no right to go anywhere unless Joe Biden, Fauci and Leana Wen all agree you can. This is communism growing quickly in America. Only the rich and elite, who make the insane rules for Covid, are allowed to have fun, go out to eat, travel and go to shows and sporting events. If you don’t believe it, ask the China Flu dictators, who are threatening all Americans with loss of all rights, if they refuse to be shot up with billions of blood-clotting prions.\n\n“If you want to stay unvaccinated, that’s your choice, but if you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine,” declares the communist talking head from television who goes by the name Leana Wen. Wen has been paid to say interstate travel should be illegal for anyone who doesn’t like their organs and blood vessels filled with toxic spike proteins.\n\nChina Flu promoter and death-by-vax ‘aficionado’ Dr. Wen says going out in public without the Covid vaccine is just like drunk driving, you endanger society, but really, the vaccines are toxic inside your body, just like alcohol, so it’s actually the vaccinated that should not be allowed to drive anywhere anymore or even operate heavy machinery, including airplanes and trains. They are causing vaccine-induced accidents, a.k.a. ‘vaxidents,’ all over the US roadways and highways. How does this happen?\n\nMillions of people are suffering from myocarditis, anaphylaxis and blood clots from the Wuhan jabs, making them highly susceptible to passing out or having a stroke behind the wheel. So vaccine passports would only be useful if those passports SUSPEND driving privileges for all Covid-vaccinated sheeple until the vaccines are proven safe for the short and long term.\n\n“Excuse me, sir/ma’am, have you been drinking alcohol or have you been injected with the clot shot? (“Yes, the clot shot sir.”) You are under arrest and being charged with DW-SPI – driving while spike-protein injected.”\n\nHaving the right to travel, breathe clean air and eat food is not in the Constitution, so the CDC is now leveraging it all to force Americans into clot-shot compliance\n\nNowhere in the Constitution does it say you can leave your house if the CDC tells you that the flu is more contagious this year, and thus instructs you that you can’t go anywhere until it’s eradicated completely. In fact, stay on lockdown until there are no more colds, viruses, bacteria or pathogens anywhere on Earth, so we’re all safe. Remember, we’re all in this together.\n\n“Having the right to travel interstate, it’s not a constitutional right,” claims CNN’s medical “analyst” (vaccine industry shill) Leana Wen. She’s so hard at work, with her panel of Covid clowns, busy analyzing what human rights she can destroy next. Do you like privileges? Then get vaccinated, she declares.\n\nWen brought communist China with her to America a few years back. She loves pushing abortions for Black women (she’s a former president of Planned Parenthood) and toxic spike protein injections for healthy Americans, including all children, infants and pregnant women.\n\nIf you like going to visit other states in America, maybe because you have relatives there or you like to visit national parks, that time has passed, according to the shill “doctors” at CNN. Soon, federal cops (TSA thugs) will be checking for blood clot passports at state lines, and anyone without one will be put in Covid concentration camps, like in Victoria, Australia, and force vaccinated until death comes by heart failure (it will be labeled Covid).\n\nListen to the communist dictators talk trash about healthy Americans who refuse the deadly China Flu jabs:\n\nOver 20,000 vaccine-induced deaths from the Covid jab in one year is more than DOUBLE the drunk driving deaths per year in the USA\n\nIf the talking heads at CNN really want to assist with American’s rights and freedoms, then quarantine everyone who has received a Covid vaccine, or at least suspend their driver’s license for a while, because they are double the threat behind the wheel that drunk drivers pose. What’s worse is that the Covid vaccines have killed twice as many people as drunk drivers in the past year, so who’s being charged with those crimes? Involuntary manslaughter — that’s five to ten years in prison.\n\nPeople caught operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery who have an overload of toxins in the blood, including too much alcohol, cocaine, heroin, meth or heart-straining spike proteins, should be arrested and have driving ‘privileges’ suspended. They are putting innocent, law-abiding American’s lives at risk. This is a public health and safety problem.\n\nTune your truth news dial to Pandemic.news for updates on the war against dirty vaccines and socialism, and how to keep your family happy, healthy and safe.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nPandemic.news\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nTruthWiki.org\n\nNaturalNews.com"

        "(Natural News) Canadian farmers and activists launched convoy rallies across the country on July 23 in support of Dutch farmers, who have been protesting against their government’s climate change policy since June.\n\nMost, if not all, protests are being organized by the group Freedom Fighters Canada, which aims to end government overreach. The event used the hashtag #WeMoveAsOne to tweet out updates on the new farmer convoy.\n\nProtests took place simultaneously in several cities, including Ottawa, Toronto, Vaughan, Edmonton, Calgary, Grande Prairie, Red Deer, Lloydminister, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver.\n\nIn Ottawa, Dutch flags and placards reading “No Farmers, No Food” were raised alongside the maple leaf and symbols of the freedom movement hundreds of people held a noisy but peaceful rally that spilled onto the street outside the Embassy of the Netherlands.\n\n“We are talking about the livelihoods of a predominant number of people in this province of Saskatchewan, [as well as] Alberta, Manitoba, and even in B.C. in the Lower Mainland. There is a lot of farming there,” said Forum for Canadian Sovereignty founder Mark Friesen, who is also the co-organizer of the protest in Saskatchewan.\n\nHe added that the issue is what Canadians can really rally around. It is an issue that their farmers are going to be negatively affected by, but it’s also an issue that normal folks are going to be affected, just by the availability of good, healthy food.\n\nJerome O’Sullivan, founder of Freedom Fighters, stated online: “More major cities to come. Get out and support the Dutch.” In an exclusive interview, he told the Western Standard that the protest is in support of the Dutch farmers, who are protesting nitrogen restrictions set in place by their government.\n\n“Between the nitrogen restrictions, increased fertilizer and fuel prices, the current cost of living and inflation, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to survive,” he said. He also highlighted that these policies are being brought in by the World Economic Forum, led by Klaus Schwab, and are being implemented in all G7 countries.\n\nDutch farmers have been protesting a climate policy that seeks to put a 50 percent cap on nitrogen and ammonia emissions by 2030. Farmers are the primary targets due to the supposed impact of fertilizer use and livestock. It is estimated that at least 30 percent of the farmers will be forced out of business and will have to sell their land due to the policy.\n\n“The honest message is that not all farmers can continue their business,” a Dutch government statement read. (Related: Tensions escalate as Dutch farmers protest after police discharged firearms over “threatening situation.”)\n\n“The Dutch farmers are essentially fighting the same fight that Canada is, and have been since January’s trucker convoy, fighting in our own country,” O’Sullivan pointed out.\n\nHe also said this is also a warning to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that if he tries to bring these policies to Canada, there will be an equivalent uprising to the one seen in the Netherlands.\n\nTyrant Trudeau to bring the nitrogen emissions cap to Canada\n\nCanadians have every reason to be concerned. In December 2020, the Trudeau government unveiled its new climate plan, with a focus on reducing nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer by 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030, which is slightly lower than the 50 percent cap set by the Dutch authorities.\n\n“Fertilizers play a major role in the agriculture sector’s success and have contributed to record harvests in the last decade. They have helped drive increases in Canadian crop yields, grain sales and exports,” Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said in a news release.\n\nFertilizer Canada, an association representing manufacturers, and wholesale and retail distributors of nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulfur fertilizers, denounced the Trudeau administration’s “shortsighted approach.” According to the group, reducing nitrogen fertilizer use “will have a considerable impact on the farmers’ incomes and reduce overall Canadian exports and GDP.”\n\nMoreover, the group does not think that forcibly decreasing fertilizer use will even lower greenhouse gases, but could lead to carbon leakage elsewhere.\n\nCanadian top accounting firm Meyers Norris Penny said in a report that regulated fertilizer reduction could cost Canadian farmers $48 billion by 2030 and reduce crop sizes. The said data noted that “yield gaps for three major crops are estimated at 23.6 bushels per acre per year for canola, 67.9 bushels per acre per year for corn and 36.1 bushels per acre per year for spring wheat.”\n\nNevertheless, Trudeau is moving forward. Farmers are wondering if he is intentionally trying to cause a food shortage and conditioning the minds of his constituents.\n\nTrudeau previously warned Canadians to prepare for imminent food collapse.\n\n“We have seen from the global pandemic to the war in Ukraine significant disruptions of supply chains around the world, which is resulting in higher prices for consumers and democracies like ours, and resulting in significant shortages and projected shortages of food and energy in places around the world,” he stated.\n\nVisit GreenTyranny.news for more news related to tyrannical climate policies by governments around the world.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about Dutch farmers protesting the nitrogen policy that would be used to confiscate their farmlands.\n\nThis video is from the CADKIAH channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nFarmers all over the world are BEING THREATENED by Deep State-controlled governments and corporations.\n\nI stand with the farmers of the world protesting the Great Reset’s food agenda.\n\nDocuments reveal Dutch government is colluding with WEF to collapse the food supply and unleash the Great Reset.\n\nCanada’s tyrant Trudeau set to implement a policy that led Dutch farmers to revolt.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nFreedomFightersCan.ca\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nWesternStandard.news\n\nTheCounterSignal.com\n\nCanada.ca\n\nThePostMillennial.com\n\nBrighteon.com"

        "(Natural News) Inflation and the long-term impacts of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have been straining, if not emptying, the purses of Americans. But an analysis found that elderly Americans were more susceptible to their budgets falling short.\n\nAccording to the University of Massachusetts Boston‘s (UMB) Elder Index, 54 percent of older women living alone are in a precarious financial situation. The index also found that 45 percent of single, older men cannot afford to live day by day. Both were either poor according to federal poverty standards, or were earning incomes too low to pay for essential expenses.\n\nThe UMB’s index takes several factors – such as the cost of health care, food, housing, and transportation – that can be adjusted based on senior Americans’ health status.\n\nBased on data obtained from the index’s 2020 edition – about five million older women living alone, two million older men living alone and more than two million older couples were earning yearly incomes that classified them as “financially insecure.” (Related: More and more older Americans are experiencing food insecurity.)\n\nJan Mutchler, director of UMB’s Gerontology Institute, said the 2020 estimates were made prior to inflation soaring to its 40-year high of nine percent. He added that older adults continued to lose jobs during the pandemic’s second and third years. The pandemic also resulted in the highest unemployment rates for Americans 55 years old and above in almost 50 years, according to The Hill.\n\nWith those stressors layered on, even more people are struggling,” Mutchler stated.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the 2021 average poverty guideline for a single American is $12,880 per year – with the total slightly higher for those living in Alaska and Hawaii. This guideline can be used to determine if Americans are eligible for some federal assistance programs.\n\nMeanwhile, the charitable organization National Council on Aging said it hopes to use the Elder Index’s metrics to better understand the true costs of growing old in the country. Its website stated that its Equity in Aging Collective “will advocate for the adoption of the Elder Index and for improving the standard-of-living measures used to determine eligibility for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, taxes, food assistance, and housing support.”\n\nSenior citizens sacrifice basic necessities due to healthcare costs\n\nEven though Americans aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare coverage, data from June 2022 showed that the majority of older residents consider healthcare costs a financial burden. As the senior population continues to age, the expanding age group will strain federally or state-sponsored health insurance even further.\n\nA recent poll by Gallup and nonprofit West Health showed that 37 percent of respondents aged 65 and up are concerned about being able to pay for necessary healthcare services in the near year. The figure was higher – 45 percent – for respondents aged between 50 and 64 years old.\n\nThe survey also showed that a big proportion of respondents 50 to 64 years old skip treatments and cut back on other essentials just to cope with healthcare costs. Most of the poll’s respondents eschewed buying clothes to be able to afford healthcare – followed by over-the-counter drugs, food and utilities.\n\n“With adults aged 50 [to] 64 already sacrificing to a greater degree than their older counterparts, there will certainly be many older adults needing medical care because of the health outcomes of delaying or skipping treatment,” said Gallup. It cited the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which pointed out that “healthcare costs in the U.S. remain higher than those of other developed countries, but paying more for care is not resulting in better health outcomes.”\n\n“Policymakers urgently need to grapple with how to improve efficiency and reduce costs of healthcare and prescription drugs in the country, so Americans do not need to sacrifice basic needs to pay for healthcare or medicine or to avoid care entirely because it is too expensive.”\n\nWatch the below video that talks about the politicization of healthcare.\n\nThis video is from the The Jim Stroud Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nBrutal Trudeau regime tramples elderly with war horses.\n\nUS nursing homes devastated by coronavirus outbreak: Infection and death counts rise as vulnerable elderly get exposed to the virus.\n\nCoronavirus a “perfect KILLING machine” for the elderly.\n\nStudy: Choline helps improve cognitive performance in the elderly.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheHill.com\n\nKHN.org\n\nNews.Gallup.com\n\nBrighteon.com"

        "(Natural News) Dr. Philippe Van Welbergen, one of the original experts to find damage from the blood due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, found that unvaccinated individuals have graphene and self-assembling nanoparticles in their blood – a manifestation of shedding from those who took the shots.\n\nVan Welbergen is a specialist in biomedicine who deals with chronic cases. He has postgrad work in women’s health in pharmacology, bio-pharmacology, advanced pain management and aesthetic medicine, which is why he was able to detect developments of patients that were seemingly out of character or did not make sense in terms of the patients’ diagnostic history.\n\n“One of the tests that we run routinely as a diagnostic support tool is red blood cell morphology – it means that certain conditions can change the shape of a perfectly good red blood cell from a lovely little donut with a dimple to very strange shapes,” he explained during a recent appearance on the “Dr. Jane Ruby Show.”\n\nThe host, Dr. Jane Ruby, pointed out that there are two main ways the injections – whatever is in them – can be transferred to another person who is not vaccinated. This could be through inhalation or skin-to-skin contact.\n\nVan Welberger said that in looking at the pure blood smears, which he took straight from an individual to the microscope, he noticed that the unstained blood “started picking up unusual, tiny structures” that he has never seen before.\n\nHe then presented data showing that red blood cells – which are usually round and doughnut-shaped – have been damaged by the spike protein. Those cells have become quadrangles or octagon-shaped instead of round. They have become messed up due to the spike protein damage and cannot be restored. (Related: Is graphene oxide what caused Japanese authorities to suspend Moderna’s “contaminated” covid vaccines?)\n\n“You can’t repair red blood cells,” Van Welverger explained. “So these things are basically lost to us.”\n\nMoreover, because these cells have lost their shape, they cannot move through the macro circulatory system. Instead, they just bunch together and block things.\n\nThe unvaccinated somehow ended up full of graphene and self-assembling nanoparticles in their blood, which is the manifestation of shedding of those who took the vaccines themselves. This is often seen in unvaccinated children with vaccinated parents.\n\nChildren who had been infected with graphene oxide in their bodies, have seen different effects, although gastrointestinal complaints are the most common. This is because the cells are associated with ulcers, bleeding and even some forms of cancer.\n\nParents essentially allowing death of children if they let them get vaccinated against COVID-19\n\nTaking a sample from a three-year-old, Van Welbergen showed that the child’s blood showed the presence of sloughed graphene fragments in blood samples, which he said were likely to have been passed down.\n\nAnother sample, from an eight-year-old unvaccinated child, had his right arm and upper right leg basically paralyzed, with his thigh unable to move normally. Van Welbergen said this means the child has experienced graphene transmission and infection.\n\nVan Welbergen is not the only one who saw the negative effects of graphene oxide in vaccines on human red blood cells.\n\nDr. Bärbel Ghitalla and his colleague Axel Bolland, along with two lawyers Holger Fischer and Elmar Becker, found graphene oxide in their bodies after they had been injected with Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSwiss researcher Armin Koroknay also found that vaccination causes immediate blood clotting at the microscopic level, with the worst effects on human blood seen after the second injection. (Related: Researcher sounds alarm after finding PARASITES, nanobots and graphene in COVID-19 vaccines.)\n\nBritish microbiologist Dr. Sicharit Bhakdi also said that if parents allow their children to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, it means that they are willing to have their children killed.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more information about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to learn how vaccinated individuals are affecting the unvaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nCONFIRMED: Covid “vaccine” vials definitely contain graphene oxide.\n\nLa Quinta Columna: ‘98% to 99% of the vaccination vial is graphene oxide’.\n\nBlood of COVID-vaccinated people found to contain strange artifacts (graphene oxide?).\n\nGraphene oxide used in coronavirus vaccines linked to adverse events, even death.\n\nThe Dr. Hotze Report: Graphene oxide found in COVID vaccines – Brighteon.TV.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nGNews.com"

        "(Natural News) The heatwaves and massive forest fires that hit Europe have severely affected crops and livestock on the continent, worsening food shortages across the globe.\n\nIf the heatwaves and forest fires are not destroying crops and livestock enough, the Dutch government under the leadership of globalist Mark Rutte made sure to inflict some more damage.\n\nThe Dutch government recently imposed up to 30 percent of farmland reduction on its farmers. It imposed the same on cattle farms under the pretext that cattle manure is contributing immensely to global warming.\n\nFor weeks, Dutch farmers and their supporters have taken to the streets and blocked highways to and from major Dutch cities, as well as main distribution lines between Holland and Germany and within the Netherlands, disrupting food and supply distributions.\n\nWhat makes this particularly cruel is that the searing weather in central and eastern Europe has already forced countries that usually export food to import it for the first time in decades. Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, among others, are also experiencing rising food prices.\n\nWheat output expected to go down significantly\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), wheat output in the European Union is expected to go down millions of tons from last year, with more losses in southern Europe than in the northern part of the continent.\n\nFrance is expected to lose over 20 percent of its grain harvests, while Italy and Britain are expected to lose 13 and 12 percent of their wheat, respectively. Across Europe as a whole, wheat production is down 10 million tons or about 10 percent of its total wheat output.\n\nUkraine, once known as the breadbasket of the former Soviet Union, only produced five million tons of wheat this year, a 75 percent decrease compared to previous years. Moldova harvests are down 80 percent.\n\nAccording to FAO, losses are now being compared to those back in 1945, which is the worst in recent history. (Related: Europe hit by severe vegetable shortage… citizens who don’t grow their own veggies now facing empty shelves.)\n\nHenri Josserand, head of the FAO’s early warning system, said that in some parts, food shortages are “pretty bad,” adding that some countries will have to import more food than usual, with their import bills going up significantly.\n\nJosserand also warned that floods similar to those that caused devastation in Germany two years ago will likely hit parts of Europe shortly, as there are now ideal conditions for serious flash flooding because the capacity for the ground to absorb water is very low.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has cut its forecast for the global grain harvest by 32 million tons due to the extreme weather while the International Grains Council also believes that the world harvest will be even lower. (Related: Dwindling wheat supply may kick off global famine, expert warns.)\n\nLester Brown, head of independent research organization Worldwatch, said: “The heatwave came at a time when world food supplies were already at their most precarious ever.

        "(Natural News) The heatwaves and massive forest fires that hit Europe have severely affected crops and livestock on the continent, worsening food shortages across the globe.\n\nIf the heatwaves and forest fires are not destroying crops and livestock enough, the Dutch government under the leadership of globalist Mark Rutte made sure to inflict some more damage.\n\nThe Dutch government recently imposed up to 30 percent of farmland reduction on its farmers. It imposed the same on cattle farms under the pretext that cattle manure is contributing immensely to global warming.\n\nFor weeks, Dutch farmers and their supporters have taken to the streets and blocked highways to and from major Dutch cities, as well as main distribution lines between Holland and Germany and within the Netherlands, disrupting food and supply distributions.\n\nWhat makes this particularly cruel is that the searing weather in central and eastern Europe has already forced countries that usually export food to import it for the first time in decades. Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, among others, are also experiencing rising food prices.\n\nWheat output expected to go down significantly\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), wheat output in the European Union is expected to go down millions of tons from last year, with more losses in southern Europe than in the northern part of the continent.\n\nFrance is expected to lose over 20 percent of its grain harvests, while Italy and Britain are expected to lose 13 and 12 percent of their wheat, respectively. Across Europe as a whole, wheat production is down 10 million tons or about 10 percent of its total wheat output.\n\nUkraine, once known as the breadbasket of the former Soviet Union, only produced five million tons of wheat this year, a 75 percent decrease compared to previous years. Moldova harvests are down 80 percent.\n\nAccording to FAO, losses are now being compared to those back in 1945, which is the worst in recent history. (Related: Europe hit by severe vegetable shortage… citizens who don’t grow their own veggies now facing empty shelves.)\n\nHenri Josserand, head of the FAO’s early warning system, said that in some parts, food shortages are “pretty bad,” adding that some countries will have to import more food than usual, with their import bills going up significantly.\n\nJosserand also warned that floods similar to those that caused devastation in Germany two years ago will likely hit parts of Europe shortly, as there are now ideal conditions for serious flash flooding because the capacity for the ground to absorb water is very low.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has cut its forecast for the global grain harvest by 32 million tons due to the extreme weather while the International Grains Council also believes that the world harvest will be even lower. (Related: Dwindling wheat supply may kick off global famine, expert warns.)\n\nLester Brown, head of independent research organization Worldwatch, said: “The heatwave came at a time when world food supplies were already at their most precarious ever. The amount of grain produced for each person on the planet is now less than at any time in more than three decades.”\n\nVisit FoodCollapse.com for more information about food scarcity and more.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about how farms are being shutdown by the New World Order.\n\nThis video is from The New American channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWheat prices soar in countries dependent on Eastern Europe for grain.\n\nDrought threatens US wheat harvest, deepening global supply challenges.\n\nCountries racing to take over global agriculture market following disappearance of Ukrainian and Russian food exports.\n\nFood shortage around the world may have been engineered to control populations.\n\nSources include:\n\nGlobalResearch.ca\n\nTheGuardian.com\n\nBrighteon.com"

Chmura was reportedly referencing EcoHealth’s direct funding of bat coronavirus gain-of-function research at the WIV.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), gain-of-function research aims to make viruses more dangerous or transmissible in order to “enable assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents.”\n\nErik Stemmy of the Tony Fauci-headed National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) also wrote to Normil about the issue, stating that the agency had “proposed work for the next year of the award that may be subject to the gain-of-function funding pause.”\n\n“Dishonest” Fauci directly involved in scandal, says Judicial Watch\n\nJudicial Watch obtained some 1,650 pages of records from the NIH revealing that an FBI “inquiry” into the matter had been opened. This inquiry, the group said, shows that Fauci and “others” are directly involved in the scandal.\n\nJudicial Watch further said that Fauci and his friends and colleagues were also “being dishonest in dismissing the seriousness of questions about their cover-up of their funding of dangerous gain-of-function research in China.”\n\nWe already knew from a previous document drop in 2021 that the NIH had, in fact, funded illegal gain-of-function research at the WIV between the years of 2014 and 2019 – and possibly even further back than that.\n\nThat 900-page trove, which was obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, includes other email exchanges, including one written by Stemmy and NIH official Jenny Greer to Chmura.\n\n“[This work] may include gain-of-function research that is subject to the U.S. government funding pause issued on October 17, 2014,” read the email dated May 2016.\n\nAnother one written by Stemmy to Grant Operations on June 15, 2016, advised that EcoHealth’s research might be considered gain-of-function.\n\n“The Daszak award may have GoF [gain-of-function] and I’ve been in touch with the GMS [Grants Management Specialist] for a while now,” Stemmy wrote.\n\nOther emails showed that Daszak failed to report on time to the NIH about a grant his organization received.

Please be advised that continued late submission of your non-competing grant progress report and any subsequently requested documentation will result in a reduction of time and/or funds for this grant.”\n\nMind you, all of this exposes Fauci as a liar, seeing as how he denied under oath that the NIH or NIAID were in any way involved with “gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” to quote his defensive words to Sen.

        "(Natural News) The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate for members of the United States Armed Forces is a ploy to get rid of anybody who would refuse to carry out unconstitutional or illegal orders.\n\nThis is according to Scott Kesterson, host of “BardsFM,” who made the claim on the July 21 episode of his show on Brighteon.TV.\n\n“The military’s primary objective right now is getting rid of those that would object to illegal orders,” said Kesterson. “The function of the vax guarantees that those core people that refuse to listen to orders and have proclaimed that the … mandatory vaccinations were illegal orders, the military wants them out.”\n\n“Those should be our heroes, they should be our new leadership in the military, but that’s not what the military sees,” he continued. Kesterson added that the American Deep State has essentially purged the military because it wants soldiers to take an active role in cracking down on dissent.\n\nKesterson noted that the military’s powers are being increased at a steady pace. The military is already working with Homeland Security in several ways, including surveilling Americans on the internet, and Democrats in the House of Representatives are suggesting blocking Congress from the oversight of the military and National Guard when they are deployed domestically. (Related: FBI using counterterrorism resources on parents who oppose school mask mandates.)\n\nAs the economy collapses and as the federal government expands its powers under the guise of so-called climate change, the possibility of the entire military being used to enforce this future “is becoming increasingly real,” Kesterson added.\n\nTens of thousands of soldiers to be purged from the Army and National Guard\n\nBased on recent data from the U.S. Army, as many as 40,000 National Guardsmen and 22,000 Army Reserve soldiers have refused to take COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhile these reservists and guardsmen have not been officially discharged from either the military or the National Guard, the U.S. Army has cut them off from their military benefits, making staying extremely difficult.\n\n“Soldiers who refuse the vaccination order without an approved or pending exemption request are subject to adverse administrative actions, including flags, bars to service and official reprimands,” said an Army spokesperson in a statement.\n\nActive service members who refused to be vaccinated have already been disciplined, court-martialed or discharged. Others were even forced to pay back scholarships, education and other privileges they availed of using their status as active members of the military.\n\nThe announcement noted that this represented 13 percent of the Army National Guard and 12 percent of the Army Reserve.

        "(Natural News) Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a British vaccine educator and filmmaker, slammed a Canadian court for ruling that requiring a patient to be injected first with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines before undergoing an organ transplant is completely legal.\n\n“There is absolutely no place in this world at any time for forced medical procedures. History has taught us that you cannot impose upon the dominion of people’s bodies something that goes against their fully informed choice. It is a crime against humanity and a big disgrace,” he told host Dr. Daniel Bobinski during the July 21 episode of “Keep the Republic” on BrighteonTV.\n\n“If I were a part of the unit that made that decision, I would resign immediately and very publicly.”\n\nJustice Paul Belzil of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench recently dismissed the argument by Edmonton resident Annette Lewis that the doctors who did not proceed with her organ transplant infringed on her rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nAccording to the judge, the Charter has no bearing on the treatment decisions of doctors for organ transplants. This is despite the fact that medical experts themselves advised that a transplant was the only way for Lewis to survive a progressive disease she suffers from, CBC News reported.\n\nBelzil noted that while the patient was indeed the sole arbiter of what she puts into her own body, no one has an inherent right to an organ transplant.\n\n“Taking this vaccine offends my conscience. I ought to have a choice about what goes into my body. Life-saving treatment cannot be denied to me because I chose not to take an experimental treatment for a condition [COVID-19], which I do not have and which I may never have,” Lewis stated in her signed affidavit.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with a progressive disease in 2018 and received all mandated inoculations, including childhood vaccinations. But she refused to take the COVID-19 shot. Doctors told her that she could not undergo a life-saving transplant if she is not injected with the vaccine. (Related: Canadian judge rules denying organ transplants to unvaxxed patients is legal.)\n\nBig Pharma and Big Government benefitted from the NCVIA\n\nElsewhere in the show, Bobinski played the trailer of Wakefield’s 2020 documentary titled “1986: The Act,” a dramatic forensic examination of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) and its consequences.\n\nThe said law reluctantly signed by then-President Ronald Reagan had three purposes: to give liability protection to pharmaceutical companies so that they could go on making vaccines, spread lies and distort data to cover the rampant corruption; to make vaccines safer for children; and to compensate those children who had been damaged by vaccines.\n\n“The last two have been an abysmal failure,” Wakefield said.\n\nHowever, the first purpose was an extraordinary success. The filmmaker said: “What it did is to give Big Pharma and Big Government the perfect business model. They had a mandatory market, children had to be vaccinated to go to school, and they had no liability. So, all they could do was make a massive profit.”\n\nWakefield’s film tackled how the “health authorities” involved in this massive organized crime owned the media and the politicians.\n\n“They bought the medical school, medical training and even medical journals. They controlled the editorial of what was published and what wasn’t published in the scientific arena and they became all-powerful in this global policy,” Wakefield lamented.\n\nThis is how they easily introduced the COVID shop, to push it as hard as they’ve been able to push it to influence policy decision-making.\n\n“This even made them billionaires in the face of these crazy vaccines, which are now emerging as not only useless, but very, very dangerous,” the filmmaker said.\n\nWakefield added that the health authorities decided not to address the concern of the adverse effects of the vaccines because it would eat into their profits. “They knew that children would suffer permanent neurological damage or die as a consequence. But the pharmaceutical industry continued with their argument that if vaccines would not be administered, the children will die,” he said.\n\nAccording to Wakefield, medicine has become “blind.”\n\n“When medicine doesn’t have an answer, it blames the patient or the patient’s parents. Let’s look at autism, medicine blamed the mother for hating her child, wanting him dead. The child detects that and therefore becomes autistic. That is the kind of garbage that medicine perpetuates,” he said.\n\n“If the vaccines get to be looked into as the cause of children’s disease, they will say, ‘no, it can’t be vaccines.’ And this is the mentality that has got us into the current disastrous state is the hubris, the lack of humility and the greed of the medical profession, the arrogance, the refusal to listen to what actually is happening.”\n\nVisit HealthFreedom.news for more news related to opposing tyrannical health practices.\n\nWatch the full July 21 episode of “Keep the Republic” with Dr. Daniel Bobinski featuring Dr. Andrew Wakefield.

        "(Natural News) The founders of a new online campaign — #CanWeTalkAboutIt — hope to break the culture of silence around COVID-19 vaccine injuries by encouraging people injured by the vaccines to share their personal stories.\n\n(Article by Michael Nevradakis republished from TheEpochTimes.com)\n\nLaunched last month with a live online “Let’s Talk” webcast, #CanWeTalkAboutIt brings together the vaccine-injured with medical experts willing to speak out about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe campaign also seeks to help people injured by the vaccines network and locate resources and information in their own countries and communities.\n\nIt also invites them to submit a black-and-white photo, with their right sleeve rolled up, wearing a band-aid to symbolize that they got the vaccine, and share the post, with a short description of the injuries they experienced, on their social media networks with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt hashtag.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender, Agnieszka Wilson, one of the founders of the campaign, said she became aware of questions surrounding the safety of various vaccines after sustaining a probable vaccine injury — rheumatoid arthritis, which she developed after she got the Tdap vaccine — during her pregnancy.\n\nThis incident led her to discover the silence that often accompanies vaccine injuries.\n\n“If you take a headache pill and you see that there’s a side effect that makes your skin blue, then you obviously might say ‘okay, it might be from that, right?’” Wilson said. “But when it comes to vaccines, you can’t really talk about these things.”\n\nWilson said that the silence led her to do her own research on vaccine injuries.\n\n“That’s when I dug into this whole new level of silence that I didn’t know about, regarding vaccines,” she said.\n\nWilson said that she wanted to do more than just conduct her own research. She wanted “to do something about it,” she said — which led her to start the New York Medical Freedom Coalition when she lived in the U.S.\n\nAfter returning to her native Sweden, Wilson launched her own interview program, the “Aga Wilson Show,” on which she interviews doctors and scientists.\n\nThrough this program, Wilson became aware about the looming risk of injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe also noted silence on the part of the mainstream media and a reluctance from ordinary people to speak openly about such issues.\n\n“We all heard and knew that the rollout [of COVID vaccines] was starting and we were going to see a lot of damage done by these vaccines,” Wilson told The Defender.\n\n“But people were really scared, and especially [scared of] being associated with … organizations that were stamped as anti-vax organizations.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“We all also knew that media was silencing it. These people were denied that these were vaccine injuries [but] we were seeing all of these things happening. So I thought, we need to do something, we need to start making people aware that these are actually dangerous vaccines.”\n\nWilson’s interviews with experts and her discussions with people injured by the vaccines led her to realize “how completely excluded they are.”\n\nWilson said:\n\n“There’s no disease in the world where you cannot talk about it … you can talk about cancer, you can talk about any kind of disease out there, but not this.\n\n“They have scientists that are willing to do research on this, scientists from the big institutions, and they’re just being ignored.”\n\nThe media is complicit in this silence, she said. “There’s something more going on than just this. Why is media being silent? Why are we not talking about this?”\n\n“There’s never been a drug in history that has had so many side effects and no one is talking about it,” she said.\n\nWilson’s concerns about the side effects, silence on the part of doctors and scientists, and the media’s complicity led her to start the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign.\n\nShe said:\n\n“I always work globally; I thought now we need to do something globally, we need to do a campaign that’s going to start breaking the silence around this issue because people need to know.\n\n“We don’t want any more people to take the shot, especially after what I’m seeing in all of these groups.”\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine during its clinical trial, got involved with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign soon after its launch.\n\nDressen, whose non-profit organization, React19, offers “financial, physical, and emotional support for those suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine adverse events globally,” told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign resonated with her.\n\nDressen said she was not only compelled to speak out, but also to help others do the same. “Speaking out, especially in today’s climate, is especially difficult.”\n\n“The injured largely trust other injured,” she said. “We have been exploited and used so many times by people who just don’t quite take the time to understand the impact they can have on us and our health.”\n\nDressen described the situation as a “double whammy” for the injured, as they “have been censored and stripped of any ability to have a voice by one side, and when we do speak out, many times the tone from those who wish to use our stories is tone-deaf, dehumanizing.”\n\n“So, the injured clam up and huddle together in support groups with only each other,” Dressen said.\n\nCampaigns and support groups such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt play an important role in amplifying the voices of people whose individual ability to be heard or to enact change is limited.\n\nDressen said:\n\n“This campaign, in large part due to the simple and appropriate messaging, was able to strike the appropriate balance for the injured to feel confident enough to speak out. It was also a way for the rest of the world to see us move in unison across the globe.\n\n“It is challenging for sick people to fight for ourselves. Our energy is extremely limited. So instructions and campaigns need to align with not only our personal values but with our ability to physically tolerate the stress of the advocacy work being asked of us.\n\n“It is important that compassionate messaging and respect be there in order for us to feel safe enough to speak out and share our stories.”\n\nThe culture of silence described by Wilson and Dressen extends to social media, where specific keywords are frequently censored by the platforms.\n\nDressen said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign took into account this reality in its planning.\n\n“We already knew what words were going to get shadowbanned, so the strategy was to come up with messaging that sends the right message without outright using these words,” she said.\n\n“I am very careful with my own messaging through our non-profit [React19] to ensure messaging is forward-thinking, has a positive slant. Instead of ‘STOP’ or ‘DON’T,’ we use ‘pro-safety,’ ‘pro-informed consent,’ etc.”\n\nWilson told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has three primary objectives, the first being to provide the vaccine-injured with visibility and a voice.\n\nShe said:\n\n“People are being bullied … for being vaccine-injured, and no one believes them. So we tried to … create a safe space for these people to speak their stories, but also for others.\n\n“How do we involve the public in this? We want others to support them. That’s why there’s two sides of the campaign. One is for them to tell their stories, but the other is for people to actually acknowledge them and see them because they’re not being seen.”\n\n#CanWeTalkAboutIt also aims to give the public the ability to make an informed decision regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“The second [objective] is to raise awareness publicly so that people understand the risks with the vaccine and hopefully make an informed decision,” Dressen said.\n\n“Informed consent is not being given in the situation and the doctors are also not doing their job when it comes to swearing the oath ‘do no harm.’ So we want people to be aware.”\n\nFundraising is the campaign’s third objective, according to Wilson, with the purpose of “supporting all of these organizations out there that are doing the work to find solutions for the vaccine.”\n\nIndeed, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has partnered with a number of organizations, including Children’s Health Defense Europe, the American Health & Freedom Coalition, the World Freedom Alliance, the World Council for Health and Millions Against Medical Mandates.\n\nThe campaign also collaborates with local and country-based groups “that already have their communities in place.”\n\nOne of the goals of these local partnerships is to help the vaccine-injured find support groups near them.\n\n“We’re pulling together those groups … because we want to build communities right on the website as well, so that people can find each other,” Wilson said.\n\nNetworking is just one of the components of the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign, according to Wilson. The campaign also wants to host more live webcasts, like the June 17 inaugural event.\n\nAccording to Wilson, the event brought together “five experts and five injured, who … shared their stories and shared what they have been through in terms of adverse events or adverse reactions,” allowing for a discussion with the experts on these issues.\n\n“The most important thing was that this conversation is so needed and we need to continue it because we need to do more research, more surveys,” Wilson said.\n\n“We need to have people tell their stories so that the experts can understand what is going on. … We will continue having webinars more focused on specific topics so that we can get to the bottom with this and also support the campaign.”\n\nBy sharing the stories of the vaccine-injured, campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can help such individuals avoid continuously recounting their stories and reliving an event that may have been highly traumatic for them.\n\nWilson said:\n\n“We need to understand the trauma that these people are going through, and listen to them. Our job really is to ask them how we can create a safe space.\n\n“Some of them … don’t want to tell their stories over and over again. It comes back to their trauma and they relive it, while others who are the spokespeople are actually the ones who maybe are more comfortable doing that.”\n\nAnother challenge faced by the vaccine-injured is that their concerns are frequently dismissed by doctors.\n\n“Not only are they not being heard or … the doctors are not listening, but basically they’re not getting help,” Wilson said, citing this example:\n\n“We had one Swedish woman who was part of the webinar and she was telling us how she just goes from one doctor to another and they just keep sending her back and forth and no one can tell her what’s going on.\n\n“People have a very hard time because they just keep being dismissed. A lot of them are being sent home, [told] that they have anxiety, even though they have severe symptoms which could not be explained by just anxiety.”\n\nDressen, who experienced adverse events within an hour of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine on Nov. 4, 2020, told The Defender how doctors dismissed her.\n\n“Within the first year I saw close to 40 doctors, and had well over 60 office visits, a trip to the NIH [National Institutes of Health], and several hospital stays,” she said.\n\n“I was plagued by an ‘anxiety’ diagnosis for six months until I was able to go to the NIH. NIH confirmed it was post-vaccine neuropathy, and one internist confirmed the same after the NIH made the initial diagnosis.”\n\nThis “anxiety” diagnosis came despite a broad array of symptoms, Dressen said:\n\n“My reaction started within an hour of my shot and was tingling down the same arm as my shot. From there my health declined over the next 2.5 weeks with double and blurry vision, sound sensitivity, tachycardia at rest, sweating, brain fog, dissociation, limb weakness, internal vibrations (that still haunt me to this day), confusion, vibrations in my brain, tinnitus, hair loss, severe nerve pain, etc. I had well over 30 symptoms.\n\n“I ended up in the hospital because my legs stopped working. I remember my husband standing over my bed begging my medical teams to just run one more test, look at one more thing. Without him, there is no question I would be dead.\n\n“I was sent home with in-home physical and occupational therapy to recoup my legs, retrain my bladder and learn how to do simple tasks like sort a box of toys … and a diagnosis of ‘anxiety.’’’\n\nSeveral of these symptoms continue to the present day, according to Dressen.\n\n“I still have well over half of my symptoms: leg weakness, neuropathy, tinnitus, POTS [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome], internal electrical feelings. But the sound sensitivity and light sensitivity are gone,” she said.\n\nDressen pays $1,100 out-of-pocket every two weeks for intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n“This is just one medication I need to stay alive,” she said. “This has impacted my life financially, physically and emotionally. My family’s life and finances are now dramatically different.”\n\nDressen’s injuries — and her experiences with doctors — led her to testify before Congress, testify before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, and participate in a press conference of vaccine-injured individuals organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAccording to Dressen:\n\n“My message to lawmakers is pretty simple: after being to the NIH for research and after participating in dialogue with the heads of the FDA for over a year now, I know the government simply is not doing their job.\n\n“We did our part. We did what we were told and were assured over and over that if something were to go wrong that there would be a safety net. But instead of a safety net, there is a huge gaping hole.\n\n“How long do the injured need to wait before these health agencies do their job? People are suffering now, they are dying now, they are out of work now. They can’t wait 5, 10, 20 years for the intentionally slow wheel of government process to move forward. The pace we are going right now, progress is so miniscule that we all will be dead before the government makes this right.”\n\nThis slow and ponderous pace is, in part, due to “special interests, lobbyists and a whole lot of money,” Dressen said, which “have corrupted the process by which individuals like myself can attain proper medical care, engage in research on pharmaceutical harms and receive proper — or any — compensation.”\n\nFor Dressen, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can play a role in pressuring governments and public health agencies to do the right thing.\n\n“The #canWeTalkAboutIt campaign is an effort to bridge that gap between these many sides and provide a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn.”\n\nWilson told The Defender that she would like to see the social media campaign of #CanWeTalkAboutIt get bigger, “so that we can actually go viral and … [inform] the public that this is a serious issue.”\n\n“There are millions of people suffering from vaccine injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine,” Wilson said. “We need people’s help to share so that we can reach out to the masses and warn them that there are huge risks with taking this vaccine.”\n\nDressen’s message to the vaccine-injured is that “you’re not alone.”\n\n“Never give up, never give in,” Dressen said. “There is one thing this community has that is unlike anything I have ever experienced and it is an enormous ability to love and support one another.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“For those who are still trapped in their beds just trying to hang on by the hour or by the minute? That little bit of love and compassion could be the difference between life and death.”\n\nFor Wilson, the phrase “strength in numbers” applies to those who are vaccine-injured.\n\n“We don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” Wilson said. “We just want people to be able to know who’s out there doing what and where the vaccine-injured can find protocols, communities, to educate them.”\n\nWilson added:\n\n“We need more stories. We need to understand what’s going on in order to do our job. So we want to bring together everyone under this campaign to start collaborating … and support one another, to really have a bigger impact.\n\n“It’s time for us to come together and organize better because we’re stronger together. And that’s how we can actually make an impact.”\n\nWilson said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign also wants to raise funds to research vaccine injuries because governments aren’t doing it.\n\n“With this many vaccine injuries, it’s mind-boggling and absolutely unacceptable for the government and the medical establishment not to go into studies,” she said.\n\nDressen expressed a similar sentiment regarding the responsibilities of governments toward the vaccine-injured, and the advocacy role campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can play in promoting the reform of existing vaccine compensation programs.\n\n“HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] needs to address the failing, under-powered and under-funded compensation program,” Dressen said.\n\nShe added:\n\n“Similar to the [Vaccine Injury Compensation Program] vaccine tax that requires drugmakers to pay into a fund to pay for injuries, Washington can draft legislation that will require these drugmakers to pay a similar minimal tax into a fund for independent research on the potential harms of their products. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for this research.”\n\nSuch efforts can also target the coordinated actions of social media platforms and other entities to classify any news about vaccine injuries as “misinformation” and to subsequently quash it.\n\nDressen said such practices do not just stifle free speech, they also cause material harm for the vaccine-injured.\n\n“The word ‘misinformation’ is a powerful weapon that divides and dehumanizes,” Dressen said.\n\nThe #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can bring the public into the mix, by providing “a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn,” and also by empowering the public to drive change without waiting for governmental bodies to act, Dressen said.\n\n“The tools to fix this are not just the responsibility of the government. We The People have the power and obligation to unify and demand change. And when that change doesn’t happen, it is our job to enact change.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“Divided we fall. But together, our voice is powerful and can drive change. But in order to do that, we must listen and learn first. Can we talk about it?”\n\nRead more at: TheEpochTimes.com"

        "(Natural News) The founders of a new online campaign — #CanWeTalkAboutIt — hope to break the culture of silence around COVID-19 vaccine injuries by encouraging people injured by the vaccines to share their personal stories.\n\n(Article by Michael Nevradakis republished from TheEpochTimes.com)\n\nLaunched last month with a live online “Let’s Talk” webcast, #CanWeTalkAboutIt brings together the vaccine-injured with medical experts willing to speak out about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe campaign also seeks to help people injured by the vaccines network and locate resources and information in their own countries and communities.\n\nIt also invites them to submit a black-and-white photo, with their right sleeve rolled up, wearing a band-aid to symbolize that they got the vaccine, and share the post, with a short description of the injuries they experienced, on their social media networks with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt hashtag.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender, Agnieszka Wilson, one of the founders of the campaign, said she became aware of questions surrounding the safety of various vaccines after sustaining a probable vaccine injury — rheumatoid arthritis, which she developed after she got the Tdap vaccine — during her pregnancy.\n\nThis incident led her to discover the silence that often accompanies vaccine injuries.\n\n“If you take a headache pill and you see that there’s a side effect that makes your skin blue, then you obviously might say ‘okay, it might be from that, right?’” Wilson said. “But when it comes to vaccines, you can’t really talk about these things.”\n\nWilson said that the silence led her to do her own research on vaccine injuries.\n\n“That’s when I dug into this whole new level of silence that I didn’t know about, regarding vaccines,” she said.\n\nWilson said that she wanted to do more than just conduct her own research. She wanted “to do something about it,” she said — which led her to start the New York Medical Freedom Coalition when she lived in the U.S.\n\nAfter returning to her native Sweden, Wilson launched her own interview program, the “Aga Wilson Show,” on which she interviews doctors and scientists.\n\nThrough this program, Wilson became aware about the looming risk of injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe also noted silence on the part of the mainstream media and a reluctance from ordinary people to speak openly about such issues.\n\n“We all heard and knew that the rollout [of COVID vaccines] was starting and we were going to see a lot of damage done by these vaccines,” Wilson told The Defender.\n\n“But people were really scared, and especially [scared of] being associated with … organizations that were stamped as anti-vax organizations.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“We all also knew that media was silencing it. These people were denied that these were vaccine injuries [but] we were seeing all of these things happening. So I thought, we need to do something, we need to start making people aware that these are actually dangerous vaccines.”\n\nWilson’s interviews with experts and her discussions with people injured by the vaccines led her to realize “how completely excluded they are.”\n\nWilson said:\n\n“There’s no disease in the world where you cannot talk about it … you can talk about cancer, you can talk about any kind of disease out there, but not this.\n\n“They have scientists that are willing to do research on this, scientists from the big institutions, and they’re just being ignored.”\n\nThe media is complicit in this silence, she said. “There’s something more going on than just this. Why is media being silent? Why are we not talking about this?”\n\n“There’s never been a drug in history that has had so many side effects and no one is talking about it,” she said.\n\nWilson’s concerns about the side effects, silence on the part of doctors and scientists, and the media’s complicity led her to start the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign.\n\nShe said:\n\n“I always work globally; I thought now we need to do something globally, we need to do a campaign that’s going to start breaking the silence around this issue because people need to know.\n\n“We don’t want any more people to take the shot, especially after what I’m seeing in all of these groups.”\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine during its clinical trial, got involved with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign soon after its launch.\n\nDressen, whose non-profit organization, React19, offers “financial, physical, and emotional support for those suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine adverse events globally,” told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign resonated with her.\n\nDressen said she was not only compelled to speak out, but also to help others do the same. “Speaking out, especially in today’s climate, is especially difficult.”\n\n“The injured largely trust other injured,” she said. “We have been exploited and used so many times by people who just don’t quite take the time to understand the impact they can have on us and our health.”\n\nDressen described the situation as a “double whammy” for the injured, as they “have been censored and stripped of any ability to have a voice by one side, and when we do speak out, many times the tone from those who wish to use our stories is tone-deaf, dehumanizing.”\n\n“So, the injured clam up and huddle together in support groups with only each other,” Dressen said.\n\nCampaigns and support groups such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt play an important role in amplifying the voices of people whose individual ability to be heard or to enact change is limited.\n\nDressen said:\n\n“This campaign, in large part due to the simple and appropriate messaging, was able to strike the appropriate balance for the injured to feel confident enough to speak out. It was also a way for the rest of the world to see us move in unison across the globe.\n\n“It is challenging for sick people to fight for ourselves. Our energy is extremely limited. So instructions and campaigns need to align with not only our personal values but with our ability to physically tolerate the stress of the advocacy work being asked of us.\n\n“It is important that compassionate messaging and respect be there in order for us to feel safe enough to speak out and share our stories.”\n\nThe culture of silence described by Wilson and Dressen extends to social media, where specific keywords are frequently censored by the platforms.\n\nDressen said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign took into account this reality in its planning.\n\n“We already knew what words were going to get shadowbanned, so the strategy was to come up with messaging that sends the right message without outright using these words,” she said.\n\n“I am very careful with my own messaging through our non-profit [React19] to ensure messaging is forward-thinking, has a positive slant. Instead of ‘STOP’ or ‘DON’T,’ we use ‘pro-safety,’ ‘pro-informed consent,’ etc.”\n\nWilson told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has three primary objectives, the first being to provide the vaccine-injured with visibility and a voice.\n\nShe said:\n\n“People are being bullied … for being vaccine-injured, and no one believes them. So we tried to … create a safe space for these people to speak their stories, but also for others.\n\n“How do we involve the public in this? We want others to support them. That’s why there’s two sides of the campaign. One is for them to tell their stories, but the other is for people to actually acknowledge them and see them because they’re not being seen.”\n\n#CanWeTalkAboutIt also aims to give the public the ability to make an informed decision regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“The second [objective] is to raise awareness publicly so that people understand the risks with the vaccine and hopefully make an informed decision,” Dressen said.\n\n“Informed consent is not being given in the situation and the doctors are also not doing their job when it comes to swearing the oath ‘do no harm.’ So we want people to be aware.”\n\nFundraising is the campaign’s third objective, according to Wilson, with the purpose of “supporting all of these organizations out there that are doing the work to find solutions for the vaccine.”\n\nIndeed, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has partnered with a number of organizations, including Children’s Health Defense Europe, the American Health & Freedom Coalition, the World Freedom Alliance, the World Council for Health and Millions Against Medical Mandates.\n\nThe campaign also collaborates with local and country-based groups “that already have their communities in place.”\n\nOne of the goals of these local partnerships is to help the vaccine-injured find support groups near them.\n\n“We’re pulling together those groups … because we want to build communities right on the website as well, so that people can find each other,” Wilson said.\n\nNetworking is just one of the components of the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign, according to Wilson. The campaign also wants to host more live webcasts, like the June 17 inaugural event.\n\nAccording to Wilson, the event brought together “five experts and five injured, who … shared their stories and shared what they have been through in terms of adverse events or adverse reactions,” allowing for a discussion with the experts on these issues.\n\n“The most important thing was that this conversation is so needed and we need to continue it because we need to do more research, more surveys,” Wilson said.\n\n“We need to have people tell their stories so that the experts can understand what is going on. … We will continue having webinars more focused on specific topics so that we can get to the bottom with this and also support the campaign.”\n\nBy sharing the stories of the vaccine-injured, campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can help such individuals avoid continuously recounting their stories and reliving an event that may have been highly traumatic for them.\n\nWilson said:\n\n“We need to understand the trauma that these people are going through, and listen to them.

        "(Natural News) Just about everything that was forced on Americans throughout the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic came from “science” that Deborah Birx says she and Tony Fauci made up on the fly.\n\nBirx recently wrote a book that contains numerous admissions about the crimes she committed while working as Donald Trump’s Covid-19 Task Force adviser, one of them being that social distancing and lockdowns needed just “two weeks to stop the spread.”\n\nBirx and Fauci pulled these ideas out of their behinds, not from any actual science like the duo originally claimed. Furthermore, Birx now admits that she lied to the former president about what was needed in order to “flatten the curve.”\n\n“No sooner had we convinced the Trump administration to implement our version of the two-week shutdown than I was trying to figure out how to extend,” Birx boasts in her memoir, which fully incriminates her. (Related: Birx also tampered with CDC data and hid information from the Trump administration.)\n\nSince she knows that there is no more justice left in America, Birx is apparently unphased without a care in the world concerning her admissions. After all, when was the last time a corrupt government official was held accountable for committing crimes against humanity?\n\n“So that 15 days to slow the spread was just a sneaky way to get their hooks into us so they could lock us down for longer,” said Fox News‘ Jesse Water in a recent segment about Birx and Fauci’s crimes against humanity.\n\n“And if you dared to leave your house, Birx told us, the only way to stay safe was to social distance.”\n\nYou can watch the Waters segment below:\n\nDr. Birx ADMITS her and Fauci LIED to Trump and America about how to stop COVID— They ALTERED the reports?! pic.twitter.com/GlhonaKoYi — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 20, 2022\n\nDr. Peter McCullough says “scarf lady” Birx committed scientific fraud and misled the president\n\nBirx and Fauci spun a number of lies throughout the plandemic that cost people their jobs, their livelihoods and in many cases their lives, which makes them complicit in mass murder.\n\nThe American people suffered greatly under the arbitrary policies of Birx and Fauci, who relied not on science but on their own delusions and fantasies in crafting policy throughout the manufactured crisis.\n\n“I had settled on 10 (feet) knowing that even that was too many, but I figured that ten would at least be palatable for most Americans,” Birx nonchalantly writes in her book about how she came up with her social distancing number.\n\nOn Twitter, Dr. Peter McCullough, MD, who has been outspokenly opposed to all the restrictions throughout the plandemic, wrote that Birx, whom he and many others call the “scarf lady,” committed serious scientific fraud and misled Trump throughout his tenure.\n\nMcCullough says that Americans were forced by Birx and Fauci “into unnecessary lockdowns and restrictions based on the false presumption that the virus spread among healthy people (asymptomatic spread),” a concept that was disproven by actual scientists who looked into the matter independently.\n\n“They cost our country trillions of dollars and they made it up?” asked someone who reads Zero Hedge about the economic impact of Birx and Fauci’s impositions.\n\n“Well, at least the trust has been irreparably damaged now,” responded another about how nobody trusts the American government anymore. “There’s no going back.”\n\n“The few braindead folks still volunteering to wear a mask are either beyond help or are just doing it as a retarded political statement … Always remember it was always about getting that ‘vaccine’ pumped into as many people as possible.

After all, when was the last time a corrupt government official was held accountable for committing crimes against humanity?\n\n“So that 15 days to slow the spread was just a sneaky way to get their hooks into us so they could lock us down for longer,” said Fox News‘ Jesse Water in a recent segment about Birx and Fauci’s crimes against humanity.\n\n“And if you dared to leave your house, Birx told us, the only way to stay safe was to social distance.”\n\nYou can watch the Waters segment below:\n\nDr. Birx ADMITS her and Fauci LIED to Trump and America about how to stop COVID— They ALTERED the reports?! pic.twitter.com/GlhonaKoYi — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 20, 2022\n\nDr. Peter McCullough says “scarf lady” Birx committed scientific fraud and misled the president\n\nBirx and Fauci spun a number of lies throughout the plandemic that cost people their jobs, their livelihoods and in many cases their lives, which makes them complicit in mass murder.\n\nThe American people suffered greatly under the arbitrary policies of Birx and Fauci, who relied not on science but on their own delusions and fantasies in crafting policy throughout the manufactured crisis.\n\n“I had settled on 10 (feet) knowing that even that was too many, but I figured that ten would at least be palatable for most Americans,” Birx nonchalantly writes in her book about how she came up with her social distancing number.\n\nOn Twitter, Dr. Peter McCullough, MD, who has been outspokenly opposed to all the restrictions throughout the plandemic, wrote that Birx, whom he and many others call the “scarf lady,” committed serious scientific fraud and misled Trump throughout his tenure.\n\nMcCullough says that Americans were forced by Birx and Fauci “into unnecessary lockdowns and restrictions based on the false presumption that the virus spread among healthy people (asymptomatic spread),” a concept that was disproven by actual scientists who looked into the matter independently.\n\n“They cost our country trillions of dollars and they made it up?” asked someone who reads Zero Hedge about the economic impact of Birx and Fauci’s impositions.\n\n“Well, at least the trust has been irreparably damaged now,” responded another about how nobody trusts the American government anymore. “There’s no going back.”\n\n“The few braindead folks still volunteering to wear a mask are either beyond help or are just doing it as a retarded political statement … Always remember it was always about getting that ‘vaccine’ pumped into as many people as possible. Now we are seeing the effects of that.”\n\nThe latest news about the Fauci Flu can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nZeroHedge.com\n\nNaturalNews.com"

        "(Natural News) A leaked video of Meta Platforms, Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed him cautioning his inner circle of the unproven effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines he called “experimental gene technology.”\n\nAware of the unsubstantiated curing effects and potential dangers of the vaccines, the tech giant chief felt compelled to alert his people regarding the shots on July 16, 2020 – five months before the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I just want to make sure that I share some caution on this [vaccine] because we just don’t know the long-term side-effects of basically modifying people’s DNA and RNA to directly encode in a person’s DNA and RNA basically the ability to produce those antibodies and whether that causes other mutations or other risks downstream,” Zuckerberg said in the leaked video, which was taken during an internal meeting at Facebook (FB).\n\nProject Veritas founder James O’Keefe noted during the release of the video last year that Zuckerberg would have been “censored on the platform” if what he said to his staff in July was posted on Facebook. He would be “basically violating his own code of conduct,” O’Keefe said.\n\n“It is yet another case of ‘one rule for thee, and another for me’ that the elite use to control the masses,” news website News Punch said.\n\nBack in 2019, the media magnate spoke in front of students at Georgetown University about the importance of protecting free expression. He highlighted his belief that giving everyone a voice gives power to the powerless and pushes society to be better over time – a belief that is at the core of Facebook, he said.\n\nHowever, the freedom to express has been throttled on Facebook and the other major social media platforms in recent years.\n\nMeta had censored 20 million posts since start of pandemic\n\nLast year, FB and Instagram (IG), which is also under the Meta Platforms umbrella, banned major groups, accounts and IG pages for speaking out and raising concerns and doubts about the vaccines’ adverse effects.\n\nAccording to a Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Report last year, FB removed 65 of its own and 243 IG accounts for spreading “misinformation” about the COVID-19 vaccines. They have removed more than 20 million individual posts since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with CBS in August last year, TV anchor Gayle King asked Zuckerberg to release information on how many people have viewed and shared FB posts containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHe admitted that FB has removed millions of posts containing misinformation from their website, but failed to answer when pressed by the host on how many people viewed or shared these posts.\n\n“I think, to some degree, there are also different definitions that people have over what misinformation is. A lot of the stuff that’s actually the hardest for us to really address is not what I would call ‘misinformation’ but instead another category that I would call ‘hesitancy,'” he said at the time. (Related: House Republicans demand Zuckerberg surrender all communications with Fauci over covid-19 and “vaccine hesitancy” censorship.)\n\nOne of the well-known personalities that have been banned from social media is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who emerged as one of the most influential voices during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKennedy Jr., who describes himself as a vaccine safety advocate, was not impressed with Bill Gates’ track record of pushing vaccines on vulnerable populations, causing serious health problems in some cases. Subsequently, Meta “fact-checkers” banned Kennedy Jr. from Instagram for speaking out about vaccine safety.\n\nVisit TechGiants.news for more articles related to social media censorships.\n\nWatch the leaked video where Mark Zuckerberg warned his inner circle about the potential harms of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThis video is from the Bit channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nChan Zuckerberg Institute funneled cash to Wuhan lab where covid likely originated.\n\nFB stands FOR BIDEN: Mark Zuckerberg’s $400M grant pushed for Democrat win.\n\nTyrant Mark Zuckerberg to SHAME unvaccinated people on Facebook by publicly labeling them\n\nMark Zuckerberg being sued for meddling in the 2020 election.\n\nSources include:\n\nNewsPunch.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nProjectVeritas.com\n\nAbout.FB.com 1\n\nAbout.FB.com 2\n\nTheGuardian.com\n\nBrighteon.com"

        "British “watchdog” journalists unmasked as lap dogs for the security state\n\nLONDON – Events of the past few days suggest British journalism – the so-called Fourth Estate – is not what it purports to be: a watchdog monitoring the centers of state power. It is quite the opposite.\n\n(Article by Jonathan Cook republished from MintPressNews.com)\n\nThe pretensions of the establishment media took a severe battering this month as the defamation trial of Guardian columnist Carole Cadwalladr reached its conclusion and the hacked emails of Paul Mason, a long-time stalwart of the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian, were published online.\n\nBoth of these celebrated journalists have found themselves outed as recruits – in their differing ways – to a covert information war being waged by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nHad they been honest about it, that collusion might not matter so much. After all, few journalists are as neutral or as dispassionate as the profession likes to pretend. But as have many of their colleagues, Cadwalladr and Mason have broken what should be a core principle of journalism: transparency.\n\nThe role of serious journalists is to bring matters of import into the public space for debate and scrutiny. Journalists thinking critically aspire to hold those who wield power – primarily state agencies – to account on the principle that, without scrutiny, power quickly corrupts.\n\nThe purpose of real journalism – as opposed to the gossip, entertainment and national-security stenography that usually passes for journalism – is to hit up, not down.\n\nAnd yet, each of these journalists, we now know, was actively colluding, or seeking to collude, with state actors who prefer to operate in the shadows, out of sight. Both journalists were coopted to advance the aims of the intelligence services.\n\nAnd worse, each of them either sought to become a conduit for, or actively assist in, covert smear campaigns run by Western intelligence services against other journalists.\n\nWhat they were doing – along with so many other establishment journalists – is the very antithesis of journalism. They were helping to conceal the operation of power to make it harder to scrutinize. And not only that. In the process, they were trying to weaken already marginalized journalists fighting to hold state power to account.\n\nRUSSIAN COLLUSION?\n\nCadwalladr’s cooperation with the intelligence services has been highlighted only because of a court case. She was sued for defamation by Arron Banks, a businessman and major donor to the successful Brexit campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.\n\nIn a kind of transatlantic extension of the Russiagate hysteria in the United States following Donald Trump’s election as president in 2016, Cadwalladr accused Banks of lying about his ties to the Russian state. According to the court, she also suggested he broke election funding laws by receiving Russian money in the run-up to the Brexit vote, also in 2016.\n\nThat year serves as a kind of ground zero for liberals fearful about the future of “Western democracy” – supposedly under threat from modern “barbarians at the gate,” such as Russia and China – and the ability of Western states to defend their primacy through neo-colonial wars of aggression around the globe.\n\nThe implication is Russia masterminded a double subversion in 2016: on one side of the Atlantic, Trump was elected U.S. president; and, on the other, Britons were gulled into shooting themselves in the foot – and undermining Europe – by voting to leave the EU.\n\nFaced with the court case, Cadwalladr could not support her allegations against Banks as true. Nonetheless, the judge ruled against Banks’ libel action – on the basis that the claims had not sufficiently harmed his reputation.\n\nThe judge also decided, perversely in a British defamation action, that Cadwalladr had “reasonable grounds” to publish claims that Banks received “sweetheart deals” from Russia, even though “she had seen no evidence he had entered into any such deals.” An investigation by the National Crime Agency ultimately found no evidence either.\n\nSo given those circumstances, what was the basis for her accusations against Banks?\n\nCadwalladr’s journalistic modus operandi, in her long-running efforts to suggest widespread Russian meddling in British politics, is highlighted in her witness statement to the court.\n\nIn it, she refers to another of her Russiagate-style stories: one from 2017 that tried to connect the Kremlin with Nigel Farage, a former pro-Brexit politician with the UKIP Party and close associate of Banks, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been a political prisoner in the U.K. for more than a decade.\n\nAt that time, Assange was confined to a single room in the Ecuadorian Embassy after its government offered him political asylum. He had sought sanctuary there, fearing he would be extradited to the U.S. following publication by WikiLeaks of revelations that the U.S. and U.K. had committed war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nWikiLeaks had also deeply embarrassed the CIA by following up with the publication of leaked documents, known as Vault 7, exposing the agency’s own crimes.\n\nLast week the U.K.’s Home Secretary, Priti Patel, approved the very extradition to the U.S. that Assange feared and that drove him into the Ecuadorian embassy. Once in the U.S., he faces up to 175 years in complete isolation in a supermax jail.\n\nASSASSINATION PLOT\n\nWe now know, courtesy of a Yahoo News investigation, that through 2017 the CIA hatched various schemes to either assassinate Assange or kidnap him in one of its illegal “extraordinary rendition” operations, so he could be permanently locked up in the U.S., out of public view.\n\nWe can surmise that the CIA also believed it needed to prepare the ground for such a rogue operation by bringing the public on board. According to Yahoo’s investigation, the CIA believed Assange’s seizure might require a gun battle on the streets of London.\n\nIt was at this point, it seems, that Cadwalladr and the Guardian were encouraged to add their own weight to the cause of further turning public opinion against Assange.\n\nAccording to her witness statement, “a confidential source in [the] U.S.” suggested – at the very time the CIA was mulling over these various plots – that she write about a supposed visit by Farage to Assange in the embassy. The story ran in the Guardian under the headline “When Nigel Farage met Julian Assange.”\n\nIn the article, Cadwalladr offers a strong hint as to who had been treating her as a confidant: the one source mentioned in the piece is “a highly placed contact with links to U.S. intelligence.” In other words, the CIA almost certainly fed her the agency’s angle on the story.\n\nIn the piece, Cadwalladr threads together her and the CIA’s claims of “a political alignment between WikiLeaks’ ideology, UKIP’s ideology and Trump’s ideology.” Behind the scenes, she suggests, was the hidden hand of the Kremlin, guiding them all in a malign plot to fatally undermine British democracy.\n\nShe quotes her “highly placed contact” claiming that Farage and Assange’s alleged face-to-face meeting was necessary to pass information of their nefarious plot “in ways and places that cannot be monitored.”\n\nExcept of course, as her “highly placed contact” knew – and as we now know, thanks to exposes by the Grayzone website – that was a lie. In tandem with its plot to kill or kidnap Assange, the CIA illegally installed cameras inside, as well as outside, the embassy. His every move in the embassy was monitored – even in the toilet block.\n\nThe reality was that the CIA was bugging and videoing Assange’s every conversation in the embassy, even the face-to-face ones. If the CIA actually had a recording of Assange and Farage meeting and discussing a Kremlin-inspired plot, it would have found a way to make it public by now.\n\nFar more plausible is what Farage and WikiLeaks say: that such a meeting never happened. Farage visited the embassy to try to interview Assange for his LBC radio show but was denied access. That can be easily confirmed because by then the Ecuadorian embassy was allying with the U.S. and refusing Assange any contact with visitors apart from his lawyers.\n\nNonetheless, Cadwalladr concludes: “In the perfect storm of fake news, disinformation and social media in which we now live, WikiLeaks is, in many ways, the swirling vortex at the centre of everything.”\n\n‘SWIRLING VORTEX’\n\nThe Farage-Assange meeting story shows how the CIA and Cadwalladr’s agendas perfectly coincided in their very own “swirling vortex” of fake news and disinformation.\n\nShe wanted to tie the Brexit campaign to Russia and suggest that anyone who wished to challenge the liberal pieties that provide cover for the crimes committed by Western states must necessarily belong to a network of conspirators, on the left and the right, masterminded from Moscow.\n\nThe CIA and other Western intelligence agencies, meanwhile, wanted to deepen the public’s impression that Assange was a Kremlin agent – and that WikiLeaks’ exposure of the crimes committed by those same agencies was not in the public interest but actually an assault on Western democracy.\n\nAssange’s character assassination had already been largely achieved with the American public in the Russiagate campaign in the U.S. The intelligence services, along with the Democratic Party leadership, had crafted a narrative designed to obscure WikiLeaks’ revelations of election-fixing by Hillary Clinton’s camp in 2016 to prevent Bernie Sanders from winning the party’s presidential nomination. Instead they refocused the public’s attention on evidence-free claims that Russia had “hacked” the emails.\n\nFor Cadwalladr and the CIA, the fake-news story of Farage meeting Assange could be spun as further proof that both the “far left” and “far right” were colluding with Russia. Their message was clear: only centrists – and the national security state – could be trusted to defend democracy.\n\nFABRICATED STORY\n\nCadwalladr’s smear of Assange is entirely of a piece with the vilification campaign of WikiLeaks led by liberal media outlets to which she belongs. Her paper, the Guardian, has had Assange in its sights since its falling out with him over their joint publication of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs in 2010.\n\nA year after Cadwalladr’s smear piece, the Guardian would continue its cooperation with the intelligence services’ demonization of Assange by running an equally fabricated story – this time about a senior aide of Trump’s, Paul Manafort, and various unidentified “Russians” secretly meeting Assange in the embassy.\n\nThe story was so improbable it was ridiculed even at the time of publication. Again, the CIA’s illegal spying operation inside and outside the embassy meant there was no way Manafort or any “Russians” could have secretly visited Assange without those meetings being recorded. Nonetheless, the Guardian has never retracted the smear.\n\nOne of the authors of the article, Luke Harding, has been at the forefront of both the Guardian’s Russiagate claims and its efforts to defame Assange. In doing so, he appears to have relied heavily on Western intelligence services for his stories and has proven incapable of defending them when challenged.\n\nHarding, like the Guardian, has an added investment in discrediting Assange. He and a Guardian colleague, David Leigh, published a Guardian-imprint book that included a secret password to a WikiLeaks’ cache of leaked documents, thereby providing security services around the world with access to the material.\n\nThe CIA’s claim that the release of those documents endangered its informants – a claim that even U.S. officials have been forced to concede is not true – has been laid at Assange’s door to vilify him and justify his imprisonment. But if anyone is to blame, it is not Assange but Harding, Leigh and the Guardian.\n\nEFFORT TO DEPLATFORM\n\nThe case of Paul Mason, who worked for many years as a senior BBC journalist, is even more revealing. Emails passed to the Grayzone website show the veteran, self-described “left-wing” journalist secretly conspiring with figures aligned with British intelligence services to build a network of journalists and academics to smear and censor independent media outlets that challenge the narratives of the Western intelligence agencies.\n\nMason’s concerns about left-wing influence on public opinion have intensified the more he has faced criticism from the left over his demands for fervent, uncritical support of NATO and as he has lobbied for greater Western interference in Ukraine. Both are aims he shares with Western intelligence services.\n\nAlong with the establishment media, Mason has called for sending advanced weaponry to Kyiv, likely to raise the death toll on both sides of the war and risk a nuclear confrontation between the West and Russia.\n\nIn the published emails, Mason suggests the harming and “relentless deplatforming” of independent investigative media sites – such as the Grayzone, Consortium News and Mint Press – that host non-establishment journalists. He and his correspondents also debate whether to include Declassified UK and OpenDemocracy. One of his co-conspirators suggests a “full nuclear legal to squeeze them financially.”\n\nMason himself proposes starving these websites of income by secretly pressuring Paypal to stop readers from being able to make donations to support their work.\n\nIt should be noted that, in the wake of Mason’s correspondence, PayPal did indeed launch just such a crackdown, including against Consortium News and MintPress, after earlier targeting WikiLeaks.\n\nMason’s email correspondents include two figures intimately tied to British intelligence: Amil Khan is described by the Grayzone as “a shadowy intelligence contractor” with ties to the U.K.’s National Security Council. He founded Valent Projects, establishing his credentials in a dirty propaganda war in support of head-chopping jihadist groups trying to bring down the Russian-supported Syrian government.\n\nCLANDESTINE ‘CLUSTERS’\n\nThe other intelligence operative is someone Mason refers to as a “friend”: Andy Pryce, the head of the Foreign Office’s shadowy Counter Disinformation and Media Development (CDMD) unit, founded in 2016 to “counter-strike against Russian propaganda.” Mason and Pryce spend much of their correspondence discussing when to meet up in London pubs for a drink, according to the Grayzone.\n\nThe Foreign Office managed to keep the CDMD unit’s existence secret for two years. The U.K. government has refused to disclose basic information about the CDMD on grounds of national security, although it is now known that it is overseen by the National Security Council.\n\nThe CDMD’s existence came to light because of leaks about another covert information warfare operation, the Integrity Initiative.\n\nNotably, the Integrity Initiative was run on the basis of clandestine “clusters,” in North America and Europe, of journalists, academics, politicians and security officials advancing narratives shared with Western intelligence agencies to discredit Russia, China, Julian Assange, and Jeremy Corbyn, the former, left-wing leader of the Labor Party.\n\nCadwalladr was named in the British cluster, along with other prominent journalists: David Aaronovitch and Dominic Kennedy of the Times; the Guardian’s Natalie Nougayrede and Paul Canning; Jonathan Marcus of the BBC; the Financial Times’ Neil Buckley; the Economist’s Edward Lucas; and Sky News’ Deborah Haynes.\n\nIn his emails, Mason appears to want to renew this type of work but to direct its energies more specifically at damaging independent, dissident media – with his number one target the Grayzone, which played a critical role in exposing the Integrity Initiative.\n\nMason’s “friend” – the CDMD’s head, Andy Pryce – “featured prominently” in documents relating to the Integrity Initiative, the Grayzone observes.\n\nThis background is not lost on Mason. He notes in his correspondence the danger that his plot to “deplatform” independent media could “end up with the same problem as Statecraft” – a reference to the Institute of Statecraft, the Integrity Initiative’s parent charity, which the Grayzone and others exposed. He cautions: “The opposition are not stupid, they can spot an info op – so the more this is designed to be organic the better.”\n\nPryce and Mason discuss creating an astroturf civil-society organization that would lead their “information war” as part of an operation they brand the “International Information Brigade”.\n\nMason suggests the suspension of the libel laws for what he calls “foreign agents” – presumably meaning that the Information Brigade would be able to defame independent journalists as Russian agents, echoing the establishment media’s treatment of Assange, without fear of legal action that would show these were evidence-free smears.\n\n‘PUTIN INFOSPHERE’\n\nAnother correspondent, Emma Briant, an academic who claims to specialize in Russian disinformation, offers an insight into how she defines the presumed enemy within: those “close to WikiLeaks,” anyone “trolling Carole [Cadwalladr],” and outlets “discouraging people from reading the Guardian.”\n\nMason himself produces an eye-popping, self-drawn, spider’s web chart of the supposedly “pro-Putin infosphere” in the U.K., embracing much of the left, including Corbyn, the Stop the War movement, as well as the Black and Muslim communities. Several media sites are mentioned, including Mint Press and Novara Media, an independent British website sympathetic to Corbyn.\n\nKhan and Mason consider how they can help trigger a British government investigation of independent outlets so that they can be labeled as “Russian-state affiliated media” to further remove them from visibility on social media.\n\nMason states that the goal is to prevent the emergence of a “left anti-imperialist identity,” which, he fears, “will be attractive because liberalism doesn’t know how to counter it” – a telling admission that he believes genuine left-wing critiques of Western foreign policy cannot be dealt with through public refutation but only through secret disinformation campaigns.\n\nHe urges efforts to crack down not only on independent media and “rogue” academics but on left-wing political activism. He identifies as a particular threat Corbyn, who was earlier harmed through a series of disinformation campaigns, including entirely evidence-free claims that the Labour Party during his tenure became a hotbed of antisemitism. Mason fears Corbyn might set up a new, independent left-wing party. It is important, Mason notes, to “quarantine” and “stigmatize” any such ideology.\n\nIn short, rather than use journalism to win the argument and the battle for public opinion, Mason wishes to use the dark arts of the security state to damage independent media, as well as dissident academics and left-wing political activism. He wants no influences on the public that are not tightly aligned with the core foreign policy goals of the national security state.\n\nMason’s correspondence hints at the reality behind Cadwalladr’s claim that Assange was the “swirling vortex at the centre of everything.” Assange symbolizes that “swirling vortex” to intelligence-aligned establishment journalists only because WikiLeaks has published plenty of insider information that exposes Western claims to global moral leadership as a complete charade – and the journalists who amplify those claims as utter charlatans.\n\nIn part two, we will examine why journalists like Mason and Cadwalladr prosper in the establishment media; the long history of collusion between Western intelligence agencies and the establishment media; and how that mutually beneficial collusion is becoming ever more important to each of them.\n\nRead more at: MintPressNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Three doctors sue Twitter over censorship of COVID-related posts\n\nThree medical professionals sued Twitter for censoring their posts regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The suit also accused Twitter of refusing to grant the doctors “verified” badges even though they met the criteria.\n\nDrs. Robert Malone, Peter McCullough and Brian Tyson were named as plaintiffs in the suit filed June 27 at the Superior Court of California in San Francisco. The lawsuit argued that Twitter breached its own terms of service when it suspended the three plaintiffs for posting the truth. Thus, it asked the court to order Twitter to reinstate their accounts.\n\n“A truthful tweet regarding COVID-19 policy, diagnosis and/or treatment would not violate [Twitter’s] terms of service, community standards, content moderation policies or misinformation guidelines,” noted the lawsuit. It also argued that the Big Tech platform violated its own terms by permanently suspending accounts that did not have five strikes. (Related: Federal judge: Twitter must explain why it CENSORED journalist Alex Berenson, who exposed many unpopular truths about COVID.)\n\nUnder the five-strike policy, the first one does not result in punishment. The second and third strikes merit a 12-hour suspension, while the fourth results in a seven-day suspension. Users who incur five strikes are permanently banned from Twitter.\n\nThe plaintiffs pointed out that they were banned from the platform even though “none of [their] tweets qualified as a strike or otherwise violated [Twitter’s] stated rules.” They added that they seek to hold the social media giant liable “as the counter-party to a contract” and “as a promisor who has breached the terms it put in place.”\n\nFurthermore, the three doctors mentioned that Twitter refused to grant their accounts “verified” badges – shown as a blue check mark beside their names – on their respective profiles. “Notable and active” users such as “activists, organizers and other influential individuals” are qualified for these badges, which Twitter said were necessary “to encourage and maintain trust” on the platform.\n\nSuit follows earlier letter by the plaintiffs’ counsel\n\nThe June 27 lawsuit followed a May 12 letter by attorney Matthew Tyson, legal counsel for the three doctors. The letter addressed to Twitter’s legal department called on the Big Tech giant to reinstate the plaintiffs’ accounts, alongside those of Dr. George Fareed and the late Dr. Vladimir “Zev” Zelenko.\n\nTyson wrote that the five doctors were among “the most knowledgeable and helpful voices in the world regarding COVID-19 treatment” that was “disturbingly” blocked on Twitter. He added that the five “used Twitter as a valuable tool to share their firsthand experiences in treating COVID-19, relay important facts, express their personal viewpoints and opinions, and promote their products and services.”\n\n“They were widely followed on Twitter and likely saved thousands of lives by posting messages from their accounts before each of them was suspended,” noted the lawyer.\n\nTyson noted that while Twitter is a private company and that it was not bound by the First Amendment, it puts “specific community standards to limit COVID-19 misinformation on the platform” which it was bound to follow. “None of these physicians posted false or misleading information, nor did they receive five strikes before suspension,” he pointed out.\n\n“It’s no accident that Twitter violated its own COVID-19 misinformation guidelines and suspended the accounts of [the five doctors]. Twitter received express and implied threats from government officials to censor certain viewpoints and speakers, lest [it faces] the amendment or revocation of Section 230, or antitrust enforcement,” the lawyer continued.\n\n“Drs. Zelenko, Malone, Fareed, Tyson and McCullough are not bots, scammers or spammers. They are internationally recognized physicians with compelling messages that can save lives. Twitter should let them post, whether it or the current administration agrees with them or not.”\n\nWatch Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American interviewing Drs.

        "Media absurdly insists COVID shots are “safe and effective” as vaccine injuries and deaths mount\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for the corporate-controlled media, which now includes Big Tech’s social media platforms, to keep a lid on Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine” injuries and deaths.\n\nThe body count is mounting and all the propaganda mouthpieces can do is continue to scream safe and effective! whenever someone points out the facts. How much longer will this tactic work?\n\nThe answer is not for long because even people who formerly approved of the shots and even got jabbed themselves are beginning to ask serious questions that the establishment cannot answer. So, the establishment is just screaming the same false answer louder in the hope that it will stick.\n\n“Post-injection death tolls have reached levels that are making it very difficult for the powers-that-be to keep the lambs sleeping and the vaxx zealots enthused,” reported the Covid Blog.\n\n“Thus, they are resorting to the oldest, tried-and-true tricks in the book, particularly the ‘if you tell a lie enough, it becomes the truth’ method.”\n\nPolitifact, as one example, republished the same article the other day that it previously published declaring that both messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector DNA injections are in no way related to the massive uptick in sudden deaths that has been occurring ever since the launch of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nReuters, which is owned by Pfizer, is similarly regurgitating the same tired propaganda articles about how there is “no evidence” that Fauci Flu shots are killing people.\n\nThen we have FactCheck.org, which published an article back in early March claiming that COVID injections are somehow preventing deaths rather than causing them, and telling people to ignore a “misleading graphic on social media” that suggests otherwise.\n\nThese three fake news outlets, along with USA Today, have been very busy lately churning out the same parroted lies about Fauci Flu shots that we have been hearing since the beginning.\n\nWhen enough jabbed people die, perhaps the world will finally wake up – but it’ll already be too late\n\nTry as they might to deflect from the truth, the fake news brigade cannot hide the fact that “fully vaccinated” people all around the world are developing extreme illnesses or dropping dead for no apparent reason.\n\nThis was not a thing before Operation Warp Speed, by the way. Only since Donald Trump unleashed the jabs, followed by Joe Biden mandating them, has “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome” magically become a reality.\n\nThose who have developed a serious health condition themselves post-injection, or who know someone else who did, are unlikely to continue buying the fake news headlines telling them that the jabs had nothing to do with it.\n\nEven so, the jab zealots are showing no signs of stopping with the propaganda, and are instead doubling and tripling down on their false narratives. “Zionist of the Year” Albert Bourla, the current CEO of Pfizer, continues to make the rounds at elitist functions like World Economic Forum (WEF) gatherings to tout the “merits” of getting injected.\n\nBourla is also making routine appearances on fake news networks like CNN to push for more jab mandates, and to vilify the “unvaccinated” whom he believes are criminals – even as jabbed people everywhere continue to drop dead.\n\n“The foregoing propaganda campaigns keep vaxx zealots engaged, despite many of them now suffering from various adverse effects from the injections,” the Covid Blog reported.\n\n“Those are the unlucky ones. It’s becoming crystal clear that all vaxxed people will suddenly drop dead of a heart attack or cardiac arrest, or die in their sleep, at any moment. And it’s happening all over the world.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest news about COVID jab injuries and deaths, be sure to check out VaccineDeaths.com.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheCovidBlog.com\n\nNaturalNews.com 1\n\nNaturalNews.com 2\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Left-wing media attacks “2000 Mules” election fraud documentary by claiming geotracking data doesn’t work, but the CDC used GPS geotracking to study social distancing\n\nThe latest claim from the left is that the new 2000 Mules documentary from Dinesh D’Souza is untrue because it claims that geotracking proves the 2020 election results to be fraudulent. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proudly used geotracking to track people during the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic to see if they were social distancing, and this was considered perfectly valid.\n\nGeotracking data was also used, supposedly, to successfully predict covid outbreaks. Researchers from the Yale School of Public Health say that geotracking helped them to learn in advance about covid outbreaks that occurred throughout the state of Connecticut.\n\nDenigratingly calling 2000 Mules a “pro-Trump film,” NPR basically lambasted it for even mentioning geotracking at all, especially as it pertains to identifying fraud in the 2020 election. According to NPR, any such claims are false because geotracking does not work for this purpose.\n\nBut apparently it does work to feed the plandemic narrative, or at least that is what NPR and the rest of the corporate-controlled media are implying by never once having condemned geotracking when it was used for that purpose.\n\nEven data collection methods are now being politicized\n\nNPR did point out that claims made by the Trump campaign about how geotracking solved a child murder in Atlanta are false because that case was solved before geotracking was even brought into the case.\n\nStill, the media outlet is clearly biased against the use of geotracking when it serves a politically incorrect purpose. When it advances the plandemic agenda, however, geotracking is considered a useful tool.\n\nThis is the state of “journalism” these days. It is just one double standard after another being peddled as “news” and “truth.” (Related: Be sure to check out HereIsTheEvidence.com to learn more about 2020 election fraud.)\n\nAccording to NPR, 2000 Mules has officially been debunked by “fact-checkers” from the Associated Press and PolitiFact. The Washington Post also declared it to be a leap of faith since “we’re just asked to trust that True the Vote found what it says it found.”\n\nFollowing the 2020 election, a group called True the Vote claims to have purchased a trove of geolocation data obtained from electronic devices showing the movements of people in key swing states at that time.\n\nD’Souza; Catherine Engelbrecht, True the Vote’s founder; and True the Vote board member Gregg Phillips all say that this data shows that thousands of people made suspiciously large numbers of stops at mail-in voting dropboxes.\n\n“They allege those individuals, the ‘mules’ of the title, were making multiple stops because they were actually stuffing the dropboxes with stacks of completed ballots – a practice that critics call ‘ballot harvesting,'” NPR reports.\n\nThere was also video surveillance footage released of some of these ballot dropboxes, though no actual people were seen going to them, according to D’Souza. This does not matter, though, because D’Souza says the data is “more reliable than video footage.”\n\nAppearing on the Dan Bongino Show, D’Souza explained that an international project called the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) collects geotracking data on violent rioters. True the Vote compared this data to data on the mules, finding that there was a “pretty big overlap.”\n\n“There’s an organization that tracks the device IDs across all violent protests around the world. We took a look at our 242 mules in Atlanta and, sure enough, dozens and dozens and dozens of our mules show up on the ACLED databases,” Phillips further explains in the film.\n\n“This is not grandma out walking her dog, these are, you know, violent criminals sometimes.”\n\nMore related news coverage about media duplicity can be found at Deception.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNPR.org\n\nLaw360.com\n\nScienceDaily.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "My family immigrated to Canada over 40 years ago to escape the Lebanese civil war. This vast and cold country turned out to be a wonderful place of welcome and opportunity which allowed everyone to flourish and prosper. I was born and raised in Canada and I’ve always been proud and appreciative of this fact. In fact, every time I hear the national anthem, I get slight chills when I hear this one specific line:\n\nGod keep our land glorious and free!\n\nBut then COVID hit. And it did not take long before Canada lost some of its glory. And most of its freedom. This is especially true in one specific province: Quebec.\n\nWhile most of the world had to deal with harsh COVID restrictions, Quebec consistently lead the world in the extreme severity of its measures. Despite an abundantly funded universal healthcare system that is “the envy of the world”, Quebec spent 13 out of the last 22 months in a strict lockdown where most businesses were closed and most social interactions banned.\n\nIn 2022, although 90% of the population is vaccinated, things are only getting worse and dangerous precedents are being set. Here’s a look at life in Quebec right now.\n\nCOVID Hell\n\nWhen COVID hit Quebec in 2020, it responded (like most of the world) with a massive and total lockdown. Schools and businesses were closed for two weeks to “flatten the curve”. These weeks turned into months. During that time, a slew of measures was imposed on the public by a government that suspended democracy and began ruling by decree. This is still true today.\n\nRule by decree is a style of governance allowing quick, unchallenged promulgation of law by a single person or group, and is used primarily by dictators, absolute monarchs and military leaders.\n\nIn January 2021, the entire population of Quebec was subjected to a curfew that lasted FIVE months. During that time, people who were caught outside of their homes after 8 PM were stopped by police and given fines. As days got longer, people had to live with the absurdity of hiding inside their homes while the sun was still up.\n\nMeanwhile, vaccines were made available. People were told that these shots would lead to freedom and normality. People were also told that a 70% vaccination rate would be enough to build solid herd immunity in the province. Quebecers, who were sick and tired of these insane measures, rolled up their sleeves. The province quickly neared a 90% vaccination rate – one of the highest in the world.\n\nSo did Quebec reap the rewards of its compliance? No. Delta arrived. And, despite the fact that 9 out of 10 people were vaccinated, the government imposed a vaccine passport in most non-essential public places such as bars, restaurants, gyms, and much more. The introduction of the passport was preceded by a massive media campaign where nearly all “news” outlets and journalists backed the measure. Those who were opposed to it were silenced and censored.\n\nSo did the passport finally lead Quebec to freedom? No. Only a few months after this controversial measure was forced on society, Quebec was subjected to another harsh lockdown. Everything closed again. Why? Omicron.\n\nOn December 31th 2021, Quebec became the only place in the world to impose another curfew on the entire population. When asked for science proving that curfews have an actual impact on the pandemic, the government simply replied that it had no proof. A dangerous precedent.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, at 6:45 PM, while people were attempting to forget the fact that they lived in an Orwellian nightmare, every single phone in the province emitted a loud terrifying noise. It was an “emergency alert” sent out by the government stating that “it is forbidden to be outside your home”.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, that message also popped up on TV screens with the same horrific noise. It was the most dystopian moment in Quebec’s history. To make things worse, the alert actually caused TV service to be interrupted for a few hours due to a “bug”. I’m not making this up.\n\n2022\n\nNeedless to say, 2022 started poorly in Quebec. Despite the fact that studies showed that Omicron was much weaker than previous variants, Quebec doubled down on the restrictions. Here are some of the measures that are currently in effect in Quebec.\n\nAll private gatherings are banned\n\nAll public events are canceled, including sporting events\n\nAll restaurants, bars, and casinos are closed\n\nAll places of worship are closed (funerals are limited to 25 people)\n\nAll gyms are closed, extracurricular activities are canceled, most sporting activities are banned\n\nAll schools were closed until January 17th. Youth sports are banned.\n\nAll spas and saunas are closed\n\nMask mandate in all public places. Schoolchildren as young as 6 years old must wear masks in school at all times, including during phys ed.\n\nVaccine passports are required for most outdoor activities such as ski resorts\n\nAfter being told that vaccines would lead to freedom and, later, that vaccine passports would lead to freedom – vaccinated people are still not free. And unvaccinated people have been living as second-class citizens for months.\n\nFaced with growing criticism, the government engaged in the most cynical strategy possible: Scapegoating. And thus, all of the blame was placed on the unvaccinated for taking up too many hospital beds. And, as usual, that campaign of hate and division was backed by some of the worst attempts of propaganda I’ve ever witnessed. In the following example, a Quebec TV show uses children to push full-on vaccine mandates.\n\nIn the video, one girl says that the government should punish the unvaccinated by gradually ruining their lives. And that is exactly what is happening now. Indeed, the Quebec government is currently going down a highly dangerous road: Punitive measures.\n\nFrom Sanitary Measures to Punitive Measures\n\nUp until 2022, most sanitary measures were about “reducing the spread of the virus”. However, in 2022, the government introduced additional measures that have absolutely no impact on the spread of the virus. These measures solely exist to punish the unvaccinated for not complying.\n\nFirst, the government imposed the vaccine passport in all liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries in the province. In Quebec, these businesses are government-owned monopolies. Therefore, if you are unvaccinated, you cannot buy a bottle of liquor anywhere. Furthermore, critics quickly pointed out that this measure actually helped drug dealers. That includes Pfizer.\n\nSome days later, the government imposed the vaccine passport in all big-box stores (16,000 square feet and more), except grocery stores and pharmacies. Despite the fact that they sell groceries and contain a pharmacy, the unvaccinated are nevertheless banned from Walmart and Costco. They are also banned from all large hardware stores, car dealerships, furniture stores such as Ikea, and much more.\n\nWhile this measure is meant to “punish” the unvaccinated, it is the fully-compliant vaccinated people who must line up in front of stores and present their QR codes every time they enter. Furthermore, the double-vaccinated were recently told that a third dose will soon be required for their passport to remain valid.\n\nBut that’s not all. The government also announced that the unvaccinated would be subjected to a “health tax” of a “substantial amount”. Despite the fact that Quebec is already one of the most taxed places on earth, it intends to punish the unvaccinated by literally taking more money out of their pockets … which will be used to oppress them further.\n\nBut that’s not all. The government also intends to contact every single unvaccinated person in order to convince them to get the injection. This might be done by mail, phone, and even in person.\n\nThe two measures mentioned above require one important yet disturbing element: The creation of a database of the unvaccinated containing all of their information and attempts at communication.\n\nQuebec is also leading the way in setting judicial precedents based on vaccination status. Please read the following headline and tell me this is not madness – especially when one considers the well-known fact that current vaccines do not prevent the spread of Omicron.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThis article zoomed in on Quebec, a Canadian province where democracy has been on hold since 2020 and basic freedoms are being chipped away with no public debates and full media cooperation. Despite the fact that professionals are warning of the disastrous effects of these measures on the mental and physical health of the population, the measures keep piling on for … health purposes. Even worse, the latest measures have no impact on the pandemic. They exist only to punish the unvaccinated.\n\nSome places around the world manage to be worse. For instance, in Austria, mandatory vaccination is underway. It will be enforced using “routine paper checkups” by police. This is what police states do.\n\nAs the pandemic subsides, people are hoping for the complete disappearance of these measures. However, some governments are looking to make these betrayals of freedom and democracy permanent.\n\nIf you live in a place that actually values freedom and democracy, please make sure that things remain that way. If you live in a Covidian nightmare similar to Quebec, it is time to wake the hell up."

        "Heatwaves, forest fires in Europe devastate crops and livestock\n\nThe heatwaves and massive forest fires that hit Europe have severely affected crops and livestock on the continent, worsening food shortages across the globe.\n\nIf the heatwaves and forest fires are not destroying crops and livestock enough, the Dutch government under the leadership of globalist Mark Rutte made sure to inflict some more damage.\n\nThe Dutch government recently imposed up to 30 percent of farmland reduction on its farmers. It imposed the same on cattle farms under the pretext that cattle manure is contributing immensely to global warming.\n\nFor weeks, Dutch farmers and their supporters have taken to the streets and blocked highways to and from major Dutch cities, as well as main distribution lines between Holland and Germany and within the Netherlands, disrupting food and supply distributions.\n\nWhat makes this particularly cruel is that the searing weather in central and eastern Europe has already forced countries that usually export food to import it for the first time in decades. Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, among others, are also experiencing rising food prices.\n\nWheat output expected to go down significantly\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), wheat output in the European Union is expected to go down millions of tons from last year, with more losses in southern Europe than in the northern part of the continent.\n\nFrance is expected to lose over 20 percent of its grain harvests, while Italy and Britain are expected to lose 13 and 12 percent of their wheat, respectively. Across Europe as a whole, wheat production is down 10 million tons or about 10 percent of its total wheat output.\n\nUkraine, once known as the breadbasket of the former Soviet Union, only produced five million tons of wheat this year, a 75 percent decrease compared to previous years. Moldova harvests are down 80 percent.\n\nAccording to FAO, losses are now being compared to those back in 1945, which is the worst in recent history. (Related: Europe hit by severe vegetable shortage… citizens who don’t grow their own veggies now facing empty shelves.)\n\nHenri Josserand, head of the FAO’s early warning system, said that in some parts, food shortages are “pretty bad,” adding that some countries will have to import more food than usual, with their import bills going up significantly.\n\nJosserand also warned that floods similar to those that caused devastation in Germany two years ago will likely hit parts of Europe shortly, as there are now ideal conditions for serious flash flooding because the capacity for the ground to absorb water is very low.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has cut its forecast for the global grain harvest by 32 million tons due to the extreme weather while the International Grains Council also believes that the world harvest will be even lower. (Related: Dwindling wheat supply may kick off global famine, expert warns.)\n\nLester Brown, head of independent research organization Worldwatch, said: “The heatwave came at a time when world food supplies were already at their most precarious ever. The amount of grain produced for each person on the planet is now less than at any time in more than three decades.”\n\nVisit FoodCollapse.com for more information about food scarcity and more.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about how farms are being shutdown by the New World Order.\n\nThis video is from The New American channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWheat prices soar in countries dependent on Eastern Europe for grain.\n\nDrought threatens US wheat harvest, deepening global supply challenges.\n\nCountries racing to take over global agriculture market following disappearance of Ukrainian and Russian food exports.\n\nFood shortage around the world may have been engineered to control populations.\n\nSources include:\n\nGlobalResearch.ca\n\nTheGuardian.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Emails show NIH funded gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses\n\nEmails dated as far back as May 2016 show that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) knew about illegal gain-of-function research taking place on bat coronaviruses in communist China but continued to funnel money there via Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nA trove of documents obtained by Judicial Watch revealed a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) “inquiry” into the NIH and its controversial bat coronavirus grant to EcoHealth, which is also tied to the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is believed to have originated.\n\n“We received a warning that one of the publications [redacted] listed from the past year is non-compliant,” wrote EcoHealth’s chief of staff Alexa Chmura in an email to NIH official Carine Normil. Chmura was reportedly referencing EcoHealth’s direct funding of bat coronavirus gain-of-function research at the WIV.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), gain-of-function research aims to make viruses more dangerous or transmissible in order to “enable assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents.”\n\nErik Stemmy of the Tony Fauci-headed National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) also wrote to Normil about the issue, stating that the agency had “proposed work for the next year of the award that may be subject to the gain-of-function funding pause.”\n\n“Dishonest” Fauci directly involved in scandal, says Judicial Watch\n\nJudicial Watch obtained some 1,650 pages of records from the NIH revealing that an FBI “inquiry” into the matter had been opened. This inquiry, the group said, shows that Fauci and “others” are directly involved in the scandal.\n\nJudicial Watch further said that Fauci and his friends and colleagues were also “being dishonest in dismissing the seriousness of questions about their cover-up of their funding of dangerous gain-of-function research in China.”\n\nWe already knew from a previous document drop in 2021 that the NIH had, in fact, funded illegal gain-of-function research at the WIV between the years of 2014 and 2019 – and possibly even further back than that.\n\nThat 900-page trove, which was obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, includes other email exchanges, including one written by Stemmy and NIH official Jenny Greer to Chmura.\n\n“[This work] may include gain-of-function research that is subject to the U.S. government funding pause issued on October 17, 2014,” read the email dated May 2016.\n\nAnother one written by Stemmy to Grant Operations on June 15, 2016, advised that EcoHealth’s research might be considered gain-of-function.\n\n“The Daszak award may have GoF [gain-of-function] and I’ve been in touch with the GMS [Grants Management Specialist] for a while now,” Stemmy wrote.\n\nOther emails showed that Daszak failed to report on time to the NIH about a grant his organization received. This prompted Normil to write Daszak in May 2016 the following message via email: “This is the second communication from NIAID requesting that you file the progress report for the above-referenced grant [5R01AI110964] that was due no later than April 15, 2016.”\n\n“Please submit the delinquent report by May 12, 2016. Please be advised that continued late submission of your non-competing grant progress report and any subsequently requested documentation will result in a reduction of time and/or funds for this grant.”\n\nMind you, all of this exposes Fauci as a liar, seeing as how he denied under oath that the NIH or NIAID were in any way involved with “gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” to quote his defensive words to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus and its many scandals can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Scott Kesterson: Military COVID-19 vaccine mandate a ploy to get rid of soldiers who would disobey illegal orders – Brighteon.TV\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate for members of the United States Armed Forces is a ploy to get rid of anybody who would refuse to carry out unconstitutional or illegal orders.\n\nThis is according to Scott Kesterson, host of “BardsFM,” who made the claim on the July 21 episode of his show on Brighteon.TV.\n\n“The military’s primary objective right now is getting rid of those that would object to illegal orders,” said Kesterson. “The function of the vax guarantees that those core people that refuse to listen to orders and have proclaimed that the … mandatory vaccinations were illegal orders, the military wants them out.”\n\n“Those should be our heroes, they should be our new leadership in the military, but that’s not what the military sees,” he continued. Kesterson added that the American Deep State has essentially purged the military because it wants soldiers to take an active role in cracking down on dissent.\n\nKesterson noted that the military’s powers are being increased at a steady pace. The military is already working with Homeland Security in several ways, including surveilling Americans on the internet, and Democrats in the House of Representatives are suggesting blocking Congress from the oversight of the military and National Guard when they are deployed domestically. (Related: FBI using counterterrorism resources on parents who oppose school mask mandates.)\n\nAs the economy collapses and as the federal government expands its powers under the guise of so-called climate change, the possibility of the entire military being used to enforce this future “is becoming increasingly real,” Kesterson added.\n\nTens of thousands of soldiers to be purged from the Army and National Guard\n\nBased on recent data from the U.S. Army, as many as 40,000 National Guardsmen and 22,000 Army Reserve soldiers have refused to take COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhile these reservists and guardsmen have not been officially discharged from either the military or the National Guard, the U.S. Army has cut them off from their military benefits, making staying extremely difficult.\n\n“Soldiers who refuse the vaccination order without an approved or pending exemption request are subject to adverse administrative actions, including flags, bars to service and official reprimands,” said an Army spokesperson in a statement.\n\nActive service members who refused to be vaccinated have already been disciplined, court-martialed or discharged. Others were even forced to pay back scholarships, education and other privileges they availed of using their status as active members of the military.\n\nThe announcement noted that this represented 13 percent of the Army National Guard and 12 percent of the Army Reserve. In six states alone, between 20 to 30 percent of Army guardsmen are unvaccinated and at risk of dismissal. In 43 other states, over 10 percent of Guard troops remain unvaccinated.\n\nFurthermore, another 3,000 Army reservists and Army National Guard members who filed for religious exemption requests did not have their requests granted.\n\n“We are losing many of our best warriors with real combat and leadership experience from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of war, which cannot be replaced,” warned Jonathan Hullihan, an attorney who served as a Navy JAG officer for over 13 years. “If military leadership fails to portray a candid and accurate threat to the Biden Administration that these actions directly threaten the United States’ national security, Congress must intervene.”\n\nWatch this July 21 episode of “BardsFM” as host Scott Kesterson goes into detail regarding the COVID-19 vaccine mandates in America.\n\n“BardsFM” with Scott Kesterson airs every Sunday at 6-7 p.m., Thursday at 5-6 p.m. and Saturday at 4-5 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nVaccine mandates, military vaccine injuries continue to threaten national security by killing our soldiers.\n\nHouse Republicans introduce bill to reinstate military service members discharged for not complying with COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\n\nHouse Republicans calling for ban on using taxpayer funds for implementing military vaccine mandate.\n\nOur nation’s security is at risk due to Biden’s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nWashingtonTimes.com\n\nTheCenterSquare.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Global campaign aims to break silence around COVID vaccine injuries\n\nThe founders of a new online campaign — #CanWeTalkAboutIt — hope to break the culture of silence around COVID-19 vaccine injuries by encouraging people injured by the vaccines to share their personal stories.\n\n(Article by Michael Nevradakis republished from TheEpochTimes.com)\n\nLaunched last month with a live online “Let’s Talk” webcast, #CanWeTalkAboutIt brings together the vaccine-injured with medical experts willing to speak out about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe campaign also seeks to help people injured by the vaccines network and locate resources and information in their own countries and communities.\n\nIt also invites them to submit a black-and-white photo, with their right sleeve rolled up, wearing a band-aid to symbolize that they got the vaccine, and share the post, with a short description of the injuries they experienced, on their social media networks with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt hashtag.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender, Agnieszka Wilson, one of the founders of the campaign, said she became aware of questions surrounding the safety of various vaccines after sustaining a probable vaccine injury — rheumatoid arthritis, which she developed after she got the Tdap vaccine — during her pregnancy.\n\nThis incident led her to discover the silence that often accompanies vaccine injuries.\n\n“If you take a headache pill and you see that there’s a side effect that makes your skin blue, then you obviously might say ‘okay, it might be from that, right?’” Wilson said. “But when it comes to vaccines, you can’t really talk about these things.”\n\nWilson said that the silence led her to do her own research on vaccine injuries.\n\n“That’s when I dug into this whole new level of silence that I didn’t know about, regarding vaccines,” she said.\n\nWilson said that she wanted to do more than just conduct her own research. She wanted “to do something about it,” she said — which led her to start the New York Medical Freedom Coalition when she lived in the U.S.\n\nAfter returning to her native Sweden, Wilson launched her own interview program, the “Aga Wilson Show,” on which she interviews doctors and scientists.\n\nThrough this program, Wilson became aware about the looming risk of injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe also noted silence on the part of the mainstream media and a reluctance from ordinary people to speak openly about such issues.\n\n“We all heard and knew that the rollout [of COVID vaccines] was starting and we were going to see a lot of damage done by these vaccines,” Wilson told The Defender.\n\n“But people were really scared, and especially [scared of] being associated with … organizations that were stamped as anti-vax organizations.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“We all also knew that media was silencing it. These people were denied that these were vaccine injuries [but] we were seeing all of these things happening. So I thought, we need to do something, we need to start making people aware that these are actually dangerous vaccines.”\n\nWilson’s interviews with experts and her discussions with people injured by the vaccines led her to realize “how completely excluded they are.”\n\nWilson said:\n\n“There’s no disease in the world where you cannot talk about it … you can talk about cancer, you can talk about any kind of disease out there, but not this.\n\n“They have scientists that are willing to do research on this, scientists from the big institutions, and they’re just being ignored.”\n\nThe media is complicit in this silence, she said. “There’s something more going on than just this. Why is media being silent? Why are we not talking about this?”\n\n“There’s never been a drug in history that has had so many side effects and no one is talking about it,” she said.\n\nWilson’s concerns about the side effects, silence on the part of doctors and scientists, and the media’s complicity led her to start the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign.\n\nShe said:\n\n“I always work globally; I thought now we need to do something globally, we need to do a campaign that’s going to start breaking the silence around this issue because people need to know.\n\n“We don’t want any more people to take the shot, especially after what I’m seeing in all of these groups.”\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine during its clinical trial, got involved with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign soon after its launch.\n\nDressen, whose non-profit organization, React19, offers “financial, physical, and emotional support for those suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine adverse events globally,” told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign resonated with her.\n\nDressen said she was not only compelled to speak out, but also to help others do the same. “Speaking out, especially in today’s climate, is especially difficult.”\n\n“The injured largely trust other injured,” she said. “We have been exploited and used so many times by people who just don’t quite take the time to understand the impact they can have on us and our health.”\n\nDressen described the situation as a “double whammy” for the injured, as they “have been censored and stripped of any ability to have a voice by one side, and when we do speak out, many times the tone from those who wish to use our stories is tone-deaf, dehumanizing.”\n\n“So, the injured clam up and huddle together in support groups with only each other,” Dressen said.\n\nCampaigns and support groups such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt play an important role in amplifying the voices of people whose individual ability to be heard or to enact change is limited.\n\nDressen said:\n\n“This campaign, in large part due to the simple and appropriate messaging, was able to strike the appropriate balance for the injured to feel confident enough to speak out. It was also a way for the rest of the world to see us move in unison across the globe.\n\n“It is challenging for sick people to fight for ourselves. Our energy is extremely limited. So instructions and campaigns need to align with not only our personal values but with our ability to physically tolerate the stress of the advocacy work being asked of us.\n\n“It is important that compassionate messaging and respect be there in order for us to feel safe enough to speak out and share our stories.”\n\nThe culture of silence described by Wilson and Dressen extends to social media, where specific keywords are frequently censored by the platforms.\n\nDressen said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign took into account this reality in its planning.\n\n“We already knew what words were going to get shadowbanned, so the strategy was to come up with messaging that sends the right message without outright using these words,” she said.\n\n“I am very careful with my own messaging through our non-profit [React19] to ensure messaging is forward-thinking, has a positive slant. Instead of ‘STOP’ or ‘DON’T,’ we use ‘pro-safety,’ ‘pro-informed consent,’ etc.”\n\nWilson told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has three primary objectives, the first being to provide the vaccine-injured with visibility and a voice.\n\nShe said:\n\n“People are being bullied … for being vaccine-injured, and no one believes them. So we tried to … create a safe space for these people to speak their stories, but also for others.\n\n“How do we involve the public in this? We want others to support them. That’s why there’s two sides of the campaign. One is for them to tell their stories, but the other is for people to actually acknowledge them and see them because they’re not being seen.”\n\n#CanWeTalkAboutIt also aims to give the public the ability to make an informed decision regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“The second [objective] is to raise awareness publicly so that people understand the risks with the vaccine and hopefully make an informed decision,” Dressen said.\n\n“Informed consent is not being given in the situation and the doctors are also not doing their job when it comes to swearing the oath ‘do no harm.’ So we want people to be aware.”\n\nFundraising is the campaign’s third objective, according to Wilson, with the purpose of “supporting all of these organizations out there that are doing the work to find solutions for the vaccine.”\n\nIndeed, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has partnered with a number of organizations, including Children’s Health Defense Europe, the American Health & Freedom Coalition, the World Freedom Alliance, the World Council for Health and Millions Against Medical Mandates.\n\nThe campaign also collaborates with local and country-based groups “that already have their communities in place.”\n\nOne of the goals of these local partnerships is to help the vaccine-injured find support groups near them.\n\n“We’re pulling together those groups … because we want to build communities right on the website as well, so that people can find each other,” Wilson said.\n\nNetworking is just one of the components of the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign, according to Wilson. The campaign also wants to host more live webcasts, like the June 17 inaugural event.\n\nAccording to Wilson, the event brought together “five experts and five injured, who … shared their stories and shared what they have been through in terms of adverse events or adverse reactions,” allowing for a discussion with the experts on these issues.\n\n“The most important thing was that this conversation is so needed and we need to continue it because we need to do more research, more surveys,” Wilson said.\n\n“We need to have people tell their stories so that the experts can understand what is going on. … We will continue having webinars more focused on specific topics so that we can get to the bottom with this and also support the campaign.”\n\nBy sharing the stories of the vaccine-injured, campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can help such individuals avoid continuously recounting their stories and reliving an event that may have been highly traumatic for them.\n\nWilson said:\n\n“We need to understand the trauma that these people are going through, and listen to them. Our job really is to ask them how we can create a safe space.\n\n“Some of them … don’t want to tell their stories over and over again. It comes back to their trauma and they relive it, while others who are the spokespeople are actually the ones who maybe are more comfortable doing that.”\n\nAnother challenge faced by the vaccine-injured is that their concerns are frequently dismissed by doctors.\n\n“Not only are they not being heard or … the doctors are not listening, but basically they’re not getting help,” Wilson said, citing this example:\n\n“We had one Swedish woman who was part of the webinar and she was telling us how she just goes from one doctor to another and they just keep sending her back and forth and no one can tell her what’s going on.\n\n“People have a very hard time because they just keep being dismissed. A lot of them are being sent home, [told] that they have anxiety, even though they have severe symptoms which could not be explained by just anxiety.”\n\nDressen, who experienced adverse events within an hour of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine on Nov. 4, 2020, told The Defender how doctors dismissed her.\n\n“Within the first year I saw close to 40 doctors, and had well over 60 office visits, a trip to the NIH [National Institutes of Health], and several hospital stays,” she said.\n\n“I was plagued by an ‘anxiety’ diagnosis for six months until I was able to go to the NIH. NIH confirmed it was post-vaccine neuropathy, and one internist confirmed the same after the NIH made the initial diagnosis.”\n\nThis “anxiety” diagnosis came despite a broad array of symptoms, Dressen said:\n\n“My reaction started within an hour of my shot and was tingling down the same arm as my shot. From there my health declined over the next 2.5 weeks with double and blurry vision, sound sensitivity, tachycardia at rest, sweating, brain fog, dissociation, limb weakness, internal vibrations (that still haunt me to this day), confusion, vibrations in my brain, tinnitus, hair loss, severe nerve pain, etc. I had well over 30 symptoms.\n\n“I ended up in the hospital because my legs stopped working. I remember my husband standing over my bed begging my medical teams to just run one more test, look at one more thing. Without him, there is no question I would be dead.\n\n“I was sent home with in-home physical and occupational therapy to recoup my legs, retrain my bladder and learn how to do simple tasks like sort a box of toys … and a diagnosis of ‘anxiety.’’’\n\nSeveral of these symptoms continue to the present day, according to Dressen.\n\n“I still have well over half of my symptoms: leg weakness, neuropathy, tinnitus, POTS [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome], internal electrical feelings. But the sound sensitivity and light sensitivity are gone,” she said.\n\nDressen pays $1,100 out-of-pocket every two weeks for intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n“This is just one medication I need to stay alive,” she said. “This has impacted my life financially, physically and emotionally. My family’s life and finances are now dramatically different.”\n\nDressen’s injuries — and her experiences with doctors — led her to testify before Congress, testify before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, and participate in a press conference of vaccine-injured individuals organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAccording to Dressen:\n\n“My message to lawmakers is pretty simple: after being to the NIH for research and after participating in dialogue with the heads of the FDA for over a year now, I know the government simply is not doing their job.\n\n“We did our part. We did what we were told and were assured over and over that if something were to go wrong that there would be a safety net. But instead of a safety net, there is a huge gaping hole.\n\n“How long do the injured need to wait before these health agencies do their job? People are suffering now, they are dying now, they are out of work now. They can’t wait 5, 10, 20 years for the intentionally slow wheel of government process to move forward. The pace we are going right now, progress is so miniscule that we all will be dead before the government makes this right.”\n\nThis slow and ponderous pace is, in part, due to “special interests, lobbyists and a whole lot of money,” Dressen said, which “have corrupted the process by which individuals like myself can attain proper medical care, engage in research on pharmaceutical harms and receive proper — or any — compensation.”\n\nFor Dressen, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can play a role in pressuring governments and public health agencies to do the right thing.\n\n“The #canWeTalkAboutIt campaign is an effort to bridge that gap between these many sides and provide a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn.”\n\nWilson told The Defender that she would like to see the social media campaign of #CanWeTalkAboutIt get bigger, “so that we can actually go viral and … [inform] the public that this is a serious issue.”\n\n“There are millions of people suffering from vaccine injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine,” Wilson said. “We need people’s help to share so that we can reach out to the masses and warn them that there are huge risks with taking this vaccine.”\n\nDressen’s message to the vaccine-injured is that “you’re not alone.”\n\n“Never give up, never give in,” Dressen said. “There is one thing this community has that is unlike anything I have ever experienced and it is an enormous ability to love and support one another.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“For those who are still trapped in their beds just trying to hang on by the hour or by the minute? That little bit of love and compassion could be the difference between life and death.”\n\nFor Wilson, the phrase “strength in numbers” applies to those who are vaccine-injured.\n\n“We don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” Wilson said. “We just want people to be able to know who’s out there doing what and where the vaccine-injured can find protocols, communities, to educate them.”\n\nWilson added:\n\n“We need more stories. We need to understand what’s going on in order to do our job. So we want to bring together everyone under this campaign to start collaborating … and support one another, to really have a bigger impact.\n\n“It’s time for us to come together and organize better because we’re stronger together. And that’s how we can actually make an impact.”\n\nWilson said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign also wants to raise funds to research vaccine injuries because governments aren’t doing it.\n\n“With this many vaccine injuries, it’s mind-boggling and absolutely unacceptable for the government and the medical establishment not to go into studies,” she said.\n\nDressen expressed a similar sentiment regarding the responsibilities of governments toward the vaccine-injured, and the advocacy role campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can play in promoting the reform of existing vaccine compensation programs.\n\n“HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] needs to address the failing, under-powered and under-funded compensation program,” Dressen said.\n\nShe added:\n\n“Similar to the [Vaccine Injury Compensation Program] vaccine tax that requires drugmakers to pay into a fund to pay for injuries, Washington can draft legislation that will require these drugmakers to pay a similar minimal tax into a fund for independent research on the potential harms of their products. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for this research.”\n\nSuch efforts can also target the coordinated actions of social media platforms and other entities to classify any news about vaccine injuries as “misinformation” and to subsequently quash it.\n\nDressen said such practices do not just stifle free speech, they also cause material harm for the vaccine-injured.\n\n“The word ‘misinformation’ is a powerful weapon that divides and dehumanizes,” Dressen said.\n\nThe #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can bring the public into the mix, by providing “a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn,” and also by empowering the public to drive change without waiting for governmental bodies to act, Dressen said.\n\n“The tools to fix this are not just the responsibility of the government. We The People have the power and obligation to unify and demand change. And when that change doesn’t happen, it is our job to enact change.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“Divided we fall. But together, our voice is powerful and can drive change. But in order to do that, we must listen and learn first. Can we talk about it?”\n\nRead more at: TheEpochTimes.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "According to an ex-pharmaceutical industry and biotech executive, documents obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine suggest the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Moderna colluded to bypass regulatory and scientific standards used to ensure products are safe.\n\nAlexandra Latypova has spent 25 years in pharmaceutical research and development working with more than 60 companies worldwide to submit data to the FDA on hundreds of clinical trials.\n\nAfter analyzing 699 pages of studies and test results “supposedly used by the FDA to clear Moderna’s mRNA platform-based mRNA-1273, or Spikevax,” Latypova told The Defender she believes U.S. health agencies are lying to the public on behalf of vaccine manufacturers.\n\n“It is evident that the FDA and NIH [National Institutes of Health] colluded with Moderna to subvert the regulatory and scientific standards of drug safety testing,” Latypova said.\n\n“They accepted fraudulent test designs, substitutions of test articles, glaring omissions and whitewashing of serious signs of health damage by the product, then lied to the public on behalf of the manufacturers.”\n\nIn an op-ed on Trial Site News, Latypova disclosed the following findings:\n\nModerna’s nonclinical summary contains mostly irrelevant materials. Moderna claims the active substance — mRNA in Spikevax — does not need to be studied for toxicity and can be replaced with any other mRNA without further testing. Moderna’s nonclinical program consisted of irrelevant studies of unapproved mRNAs and only one non-GLP [Good Laboratory Practice] toxicology study of mRNA-1273 — the active substance in Spikevax. There are two separate investigational new drug numbers for mRNA-1273. One is held by Moderna, the other by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases within the NIH, representing a “serious conflict of interest.” The FDA failed to question Moderna’s “scientifically dishonest studies” dismissing an “extremely significant risk” of vaccine-induced antibody-enhanced disease. The FDA and Moderna lied about reproductive toxicology studies in public disclosures and product labeling.\n\n“Moderna’s documents are poorly and often incompetently written — with numerous hypothetical statements unsupported by any data, proposed theories, and admission of using unvalidated assays and repetitive paragraphs throughout,” Latypova wrote.\n\n“Quite shockingly, this represents the entire safety toxicology assessment for an extremely novel product that has gotten injected into millions of arms worldwide.”…."

        "More than twice as many Americans have lost a household member to a Covid vaccine injury as have lost one to Covid.\n\nThat’s the shocking finding of a new poll of 1,500 Americans carried out by the polling company Pollfish.\n\nWhile 3.6% of respondents said someone in their household had died from COVID-19, 7.9% said one had died as a result of Covid vaccination.\n\nThe poll also found that 8.5% said they had been injured by their vaccination, 5% that they had sought medical help, and 3.3% that they had been hospitalized, the same proportion who said that as a result of vaccination they were no longer able to work a full day or at all. These are percentages of all respondents. If we look only at the 74.3% vaccinated with at least one dose then the figures, as a proportion of vaccinated persons, are 11.5% injured, 6.8% needing medical help, 4.5% hospitalized, and 4.5% unable to work. While these figures are self-reported and there is no control group, since the unvaccinated were not asked about adverse events, they are still alarmingly high.\n\nThe poll also found that, among those who reported a Covid death in their household, more than twice as many reported that it occurred after the person was vaccinated than before (2.4% vs 1.1%). The proportion who said they had contracted Covid before their vaccination (17.5%) was very similar to the proportion who said they contracted it afterwards (15.7%). These figures are not indicative of a highly effective vaccine against either infection or death…"

        "Two years ago, I investigated an alleged laboratory accident at the Lugar Center, the Pentagon biolaboratory in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, which had resulted in the death of two Filipinos working in the laboratory. The death cases were hidden by the local authorities but I recorded on camera witnesses who testified about this tragic incident.\n\nThe Lugar Center, the Pentagon-funded biolaboratory in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi (photo: Dilyana Gaytandzhieva)\n\nHowever, what then seemed to me to be a local issue, turned out to be part of a bigger story. The Lugar Center in Georgia is just one of the many Pentagon biolaboratories in 25 countries across the world. They are funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a $ 2.1 billion military program – Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), and are located in former Soviet Union countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. Much of their work is classified and includes projects on bio-agents and pathogens with pandemic potential.\n\nThe first known case of use of biological weapons in our history was 250 years ago when the British gave blankets infected with smallpox to the indigenous people of North America. As a result, a great many of them died and the British Empire gained control over the whole continent. 250 years on, history repeats itself. Biological weapons are definitely much more effective than nuclear weapons. The use of nuclear weapons leaves traces: an airplane taking off from an aerodrome and launching a rocket, a large number of participants in preparation of an attack. Therefore, the perpetrators can be easily detected and held to account. Conversely, viruses can be used as weapons, though, they do not leave such immediate or discernible traces and it takes only a few crazy people who have decided to kill millions.\n\nAccording to some scientific estimates, biological weapons can potentially destroy up to two thirds of the global population in just a year. Our world is one big metropolis and even one virus engineered in a laboratory would be able to fulfil this goal in a short period of time, at a minimal cost and without leaving traces to the perpetrator.\n\nBelow, I am presenting information about what I have discovered while investigating Pentagon biolaboratories abroad.\n\nGenetic Study on Bats\n\nThe Lugar Center, a $161 million Pentagon-funded biolaboratory in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, discovered coronaviruses in bats with presumably pandemic potential as early as 2014, documents have revealed.\n\nFurthermore, in 2017 the Pentagon launched a $6.5 million program in cooperation with the Lugar Center involving genetic studies on coronaviruses in 5,000 bats collected in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Jordan.\n\nCoincidentally, the same Pentagon contractor tasked with the US DoD bat-research program – Eco Health Alliance, USA, also collected bats and isolated coronaviruses along with Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Eco Health Alliance received a $3.7 million grant from the US National Institute of Health (NIH) to collect and study coronaviruses in bats in China from 2014 to 2019.\n\nNovel Coronaviruses\n\nThe Lugar Center sparked controversy about possible dual-use research in 2018 when leaked documents revealed that US diplomats in Georgia were involved in trafficking of frozen human blood and pathogens for a secret military program.\n\nDocuments reveal that the Lugar Center also studied coronaviruses in bats.\n\nIn 2012 the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) collected and sampled 236 bats for research in Georgia in cooperation with the Lugar Center. The project was funded by the US DoD Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Part of the samples were shipped to CDC (Atlanta), for screening for multiple pathogens, another part was stored at the Lugar Center for further studies.\n\nIn 2014 the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) launched a second project “Emerging zoonotic pathogens in Georgian bats” along with Georgian scientists at the Lugar Center. The project was funded by the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC).\n\nProject G-2101Former Bioweapon Scientists working at the Lugar Center\n\nISTC, the organisation that funded the bat project in Georgia in 2014, was established in 1992 as a non-proliferation international program, providing former biological and chemical weapons scientists with new opportunities for sustainable, peaceful employment. Seven of the Georgian scientists involved in the ISTC bat research project in Georgia turn out to be former bioweapon scientists who had previously worked on the development of bioweapons, according to the ISTC project documents. Among them is Paata Imnadze, the deputy-director of the Georgian National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) where the Lugar Center is located….\n\n7 out of 12 Lugar Center employees involved in the bat research project were former bioweapon scientists who had previously worked on the development of biological weapons in the past…."

        "Chinese scientists have reported that the coronavirus ripping through populations worldwide is much more likely than its close cousin Sars to bind to human cells, as it contains unexpected genes which link it to HIV and Ebola.\n\nThe research comes from Nankai University in the north Chinese city of Tianjin. Published on February 14, it has already become one of the most viewed papers on the platform, indicating the massive interest both in China and abroad for the latest findings on the virus.\n\nIt is well-known by now that 2019-nCoV shares over 80 percent of its DNA with Sars virus, making the cause of the 2002/3 outbreak in Southeast Asia its closest genetic relative. Sars invaded the human body by binding to a receptor protein, called ACE2, on the membranes of cells. But this was ultimately the downfall of that virus — ACE2 is rare in the cells of healthy people, which limited the spread of Sars significantly, resulting in it burning itself out by 2004. In the end, only about 8,000 people worldwide were infected, as compared to covid-19 which has already infected over 80,000 people.\n\nUnlike Sars though, the novel Coronavirus has a section of genes that are absent from the Sars genome, according to this research. In fact, they bear resemblance to genes found in HIV and Ebola. These genes may encode for a different pathway targeting the protein furin on human cells, which is how HIV and Ebola attack. If it operates as those other viruses do, this mutation could make it up to 1,000 times better at binding to human cells than Sars.\n\nHearing the names of these terrible plagues will hardly serve to inspire confidence in those afraid that the world is spiralling into a global pandemic. Nevertheless, there is a silver lining to this news: Gaining deeper understanding into the precise genetic nature of the coronavirus will enlighten the scientists working on it as to how it transmits from person to person, what a vaccine for it would look like, and ultimately, how it can be stopped.\n\nA controversial bedfellow\n\nThe suggestion that the coronavirus may bear some similarities to HIV has sparked controversy before. Earlier this month, a pre-print paper was published on bioRxiv entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag”, suggested that some HIV genes may have actually leapt into 2019-nCoV, making it more contagious and therefore dangerous. The paper soon came under fire for the spuriousness of its results, and the authors have acknowledged that it would not have gotten through peer-review in that version. After all, this is the point of peer review: to challenge, clarify and pick holes in research before official publication.\n\nIn the case of the latest research, the team behind it have published it as a pre-print on Chinaxiv.org, a Chinese version of bioRxiv used by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. As such it is not peer-reviewed, and the findings must be taken as provisional until the final version of the paper appears.\n\nThat said, it is not the only research that has found the furin-like cleavage site present in HIV and Ebola, but which is absent from other coronaviruses — another pre-print on chinaxiv.org and a French study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research came to the same conclusion. Drugs do exist which target the furin enzyme — drugs previously used in HIV treatments. Whether they could be co-opted for covid-19, or whether this is in fact a sensible path towards a treatment, remains to be seen."

        "In 2015, Chinese military scientists discussed how to weaponze SARS coronaviruses, five years before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China – where CCP scientists were collaborating with a US-funded NGO on so-called ‘gain of function’ research to make bat coronaviruses infect humans more easily. In a 263-page document, written by People’s Liberation Army scientists and senior Chinese public health officials and obtained by the US State Department during its investigation into the origins of COVID-19, PLA scientists note how a sudden surge of patients requiring hospitalization during a bioweapon attack “could cause the enemy’s medical system to collapse,” according to The Weekend Australian (a subsidiary of News Corp). It suggests that SARS coronaviruses could herald a “new era of genetic weapons,” and noted that they can be “artificially manipulated into an emerging human ­disease virus, then weaponized and unleashed in a way never seen before.”…\n\nFormer US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his chief China adviser, Miles Yu, referenced the document in a February op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, writing that “A 2015 PLA study treated the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak as a ‘contemporary genetic weapon’ launched by foreign forces.”…\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/chinese-military-discussed-weaponizing-covid-2015-cause-enemys-medical-system-collapse\n\nTwo points: Yes sars is also a bioweapon, possibly created by the Lugar bioweapons facility in Georgia (see below). This is not news. But more importantly, the use of a non-race-specific bioweapon like sars-cov2 begs the question of how it could be used to target a specific population without blowback to the aggressor, especially given porous borders and high speed international travel. Clearly, specific population targeting would require the cooperation of the medical establishment in the targeted country. The US health bureaucracy has distinguished itself as a prodigious purveyor of lethal disinformation regarding prevention, therapeutics, acute treatment and experimental injections for covid. Need I say more?\n\nGiven the networking and cooperation occurring at the top of the planetary pyramid of control, and the blind sheep-like behavior of the bureaucrats who “regulate” the US medical system, it would be surprising if fauci, gates etc aren’t in close coordination with their chinese counterparts. It’s long been obvious that the satanic central banking cartel has put the US on the chopping block and anointed china to be the superpower for the 21’st century. Disaster capitalism on steroids."

        "When major events impact millions, and even billions, of people, there will, inevitably, be a wide range of opinions put forth to explain the crisis. From political explanations to religious testimony, thinkers from all walks of life seek to deconstruct those events which alter the lives of the masses.\n\nWhen it comes to what I will call the “conspiracy research community”, one theory often proposed as an explanation to the chaos of our world is known as predictive programming. When searching for specific definitions of this theory you find derogatory analyses, true believers, and the curious.\n\nAccording to a researcher at Ohio University:\n\n“Predictive Programming is theory that the government or other higher-ups are using fictional movies or books as a mass mind control tool to make the population more accepting of planned future events. This was described by researcher Alan Watt who defines Predictive programming as “Predictive programming is a subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes to be implemented by our leaders. If and when these changes are put through, the public will already be familiarized with them and will accept them as natural progressions, thus lessening possible public resistance and commotion.”\n\n\n\nEssentially, the idea is that operations being conducted by a hidden elite are shown to the public in advance via popular media such as books and films. These clues and references are meant to “soften” the public to the ideas presented. By introducing concepts that seem fantastic and then constantly reintroducing the concepts they appear more likely, or at the least, acceptable.\n\nThe belief is that the “predictive programming” in media can speak to the subconscious in a way that causes the public to passively accept the events when they unfold in real life, rather than offering resistance or opposition.\n\nThe Ohio University writer states, “I found that most commonly people believe the government creates a problem so the population will look to the government for a solution. However, because the government planned for the crisis the government will offer a solution that has been planned long before the crisis ever happened.” What they are describing is often known as “problem-reaction-solution”.\n\nThe TV show The Simpsons is often a source for such predictive programming claims. Various episodes show Donald Trump running for president, and references to September 11, 2001. For example, The Simpsons 1997 episode titled “The City of New York vs Homer Simpson” features the Simpson family visiting Manhattan where the World Trade Center factors heavily into the story. In one often-touted scene, Lisa holds a brochure for a $9 bus fare with the World Trade Center shown in the background. Together the $9 and the twin towers make 9/11, a reference to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn 2010, Bill Oakley, an executive producer on the show at the time, told The New York Observer, “$9 was picked as a comically cheap fare,” he said. “And I will grant that it’s eerie, given that it’s on the only episode of any series ever that had an entire act of World Trade Center jokes.”\n\nAnother example of this alleged predictive programming comes from the pilot episode of The Lone Gunmen, a short-lived spinoff of the popular The X-Files. The pilot for The Lone Gunmen — which aired aired six months before the September 11th attacks — includes a plot where a hijacked plane is aimed at the World Trade Center. The terrorist attack is averted in the end and the towers are not hit.\n\nHere is a sample of the dialogue from one scene of The Lone Gunmen pilot:\n\n“Your saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline – ”\n\n“There you go, indicting the entire government as usual. A faction, a small faction.”\n\n\n\n“For what possible gain?” “The Cold War is over, John, but with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market is flat. But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City and you’ll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart bombed.”\n\nThe lazy response to claims of predictive programming is to dismiss them as the workings of a paranoid, tinfoil-hat-wearing “conspiracy theorist”. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain predictive programming.\n\nSome researchers dismiss the claims as simple coincidences. The Simpsons has been on air for 30-plus years now and some of their thousands of episodes are bound to reflect reality at some point, they say. Others contend that there are some eerie examples of art “predicting” reality, but they believe theorists are suffering from Pareidolia, the phenomenon of seeing patterns in random stimuli. Those who are looking for patterns are more likely to see them because of this, as well as confirmation bias.\n\nRevelation of the Method\n\nAnother theory which has been proposed by believers of predictive programming is the idea that these so-called elites must show the public their plans for one reason or another. This theory has come to be known as “Revelation of the Method”. The first person who appears to have popularized the use of this term was researcher James Shelby Downard.\n\nDownard’s claim to infamy came as a result of his writing the controversial essay King-Kill 33, which accuses a network of Freemasons of being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In subsequent writings, Downard further explored his ideas around revelation of the method. In Sorcery, Sex, Assassination, and the Science of Symbolism, he writes, “acts concerning the assassination are on ice and will be be revealed in the future in the so-called ‘Revelation of the Method.’”\n\nHe continues, “this method and process of Masonic machinations is summed up in the principle of the “Making Manifest of All That is Hidden.”\n\nMichael A. Hoffman II, was a student and friend of Downard and continued to write about the concept. Writing in the book Apocalypse Culture, Hoffman says,\n\n“We come to the current unfoldment in ‘Must Be,’ an alchemic term Mr. Downard translates as ‘the Revelation of the Method.’ This alludes to the process wherein murderous deeds and hair-raising conspiracies involving wars, revolutions, decapitations and every manner of horror-show are first buried beneath a cloak of secrecy and Harpocrates’ hushed- finger, and then, when finally accomplished and secured, slowly revealed to the un- suspecting populace who watch in deep-frozen apathy as the hidden history is unveiled.”\n\nIn an interview with radio program Guns and Butter, Hoffman stated:\n\n“The Revelation of the Method actually comes from my mentor, James Shelby Downard. I met him in Saint Petersburg, Florida in the mid-1970s and he was a very unusual man. He walked the razor edge between genius and eccentricity, but he had a mind where he was able to see and detect patterns. And also, he had an historian’s mind in terms of the research that he did, and he was the one that set me on this path of the Revelation of the Method. He also called it ‘Must Be’ or ‘The Making Manifest of All that is Hidden.'”\n\nSome researchers of the so-called “Revelation of the Method” also believe there is a spiritual or religious element of the practice. They believe that by sharing clues or foreknowledge of their plans, the elitists somehow absolve themselves of wrong doing in the eyes of their Creator.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThis bring us full circle to COVID-19 and claims of predictive programming in various media which foreshadowed the claims of a worldwide pandemic, and the subsequent authoritarian measures.\n\nFor example, the 1981 novel The Eyes of Darkness by Dean Koontz talks about a deadly virus used as a biological weapon named Wuhan-400. There’s also the 2011 film Contagion with a story of a deadly pandemic involving a virus originating from a bat and social distancing.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, screenwriter Scott Z. Burns said,\n\n“It is sad, and it is frustrating… It is also surreal to me that people from all over the world write to me asking how I knew it would involve a bat or how I knew the term ‘social distancing.’ I didn’t have a crystal ball — I had access to great expertise. So, if people find the movie to be accurate, it should give them confidence in the public health experts who are out there right now trying to guide us.”\n\nPerhaps the most striking example of potential predictive programming, or a coincidence, if you prefer, is the film Songbird. The film’s IMDB description states:\n\n“In 2024 a pandemic ravages the world and its cities. Centering on a handful of people as they navigate the obstacles currently hindering society: disease, martial law, quarantine, and vigilantes.”\n\nThe wikipedia description further outlines the similarities to what would unfold in 2020 and 2021:\n\n“By 2024, the COVID-19 Coronavirus has been mutated into COVID-23 and the world is in its fourth Quarantine year. In the United States, the nation’s government is converted into a fascist police state and the people are required to take temperature checks on their cell phones while those infected with COVID-23 are taken from their homes against their will and forced into quarantine camps, also known as ‘Q-Zones’ or concentration camps, where some fight back against the brutal restrictions. In these camps, the infected are left to die or forcibly get better.”\n\nWhile it’s odd enough that a film came out in 2020 “inspired” by the COVID-19 event, it’s even more unnerving knowing the film included scenes of “immunity passports” using cell phones, forced quarantines and lockdowns of the vast majority of the population, and even a black market for the digital passports.\n\nThe timing of the filming is also a bit difficult to understand considering the fact that most of the world was experiencing lockdowns. The film makers claim they had their first call about the project on March 14, 2020, around the time the world was learning about the COVID-19 situation. They claim by June, major actors like Demi Moore had been cast in their roles, with production beginning in Los Angeles on July 8, 2020.\n\nBy August 3, 2020, the film wrapped, making it the first film to be shot in L.A. during lockdown. While the public was forced to stay inside, and work from home, Hollywood actors and a crew of 40 people were allowed to continue working on their film. The film was eventually released on December 11, 2020 and has received very poor reviews.\n\nIf there is any predictive programming in Songbird, it might relate to events yet to come. For example, the movie takes place in 2024, with a virus known as COVID-23 rampaging the planet.\n\nWhat does this mean for our future? Should we live in fear of what might come?\n\nIn the film’s version of events, things do not end well. While the young couple in love manages to acquire black-market passports and escape to somewhere more free, the rest of their family and friends remain prisoners of their governments. The rest of the people shown in the film continue to live in the bio-fascist tyrannical nightmare.\n\nWhether predictive programming is true, or simply a matter of coincidence and confirmation bias, we should not allow ourselves to live in fear. However, we should do everything in our power to make sure these fantasy worlds do not become our reality.\n\nDerrick Broze, a staff writer for The Last American Vagabond, is a journalist, author, public speaker, and activist.

        "The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today—plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late.\n\nIf the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible:\n\nThe Mark of the Beast Passage\n\nRevelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) — 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone —small and great, rich and poor, free and slave— to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast’s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666.\n\nThis passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long.\n\nIt's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that.\n\nNot A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight)\n\nMore importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count!\n\nDespite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that:\n\nRevelation 20:4 (HCSB) — Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God’s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands .\n\nThis passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion.\n\nClick here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy\n\nFour Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark\n\nThe first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15).\n\nThe second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10).\n\nUnderstanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation / 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13).\n\nOnce you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems—including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.)\n\nThus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations.\n\nBut there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark.\n\nRefuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture\n\nThe passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution.\n\nIt points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs.\n\n(Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.)\n\nArticle continues below... \"Depart From Me, I Never Knew you!\" - Jesus Jesus predicted that he will tell many sincere believers to basically \"get lost\" instead of welcoming them into the Kingdom. So...who are they and what did they miss or do wrong? In this study, get those answers and the one requirement for salvation Jesus taught (that Christianity misses) so that you can make sure you don't hear these dreaded words yourself!\n\nIn summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark:\n\nThe 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark\n\nConvinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture\n\n\"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal?\n\nTerrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it.\n\nYet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)?\n\nA big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18):\n\nExodus 13:16 (HCSB) — So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand.\n\nOrthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative).\n\nBut we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24).\n\nWhy Only a Literal Mark Works\n\nWhenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast.\n\nThis passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\"\n\nRevelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) — 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God’s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels\n\nNow think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions.\n\nIf the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure?\n\nSince a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it.\n\nBut Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark?\n\nWith that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark?\n\nThis is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out:\n\n3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes\n\nMark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture)\n\nThe first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now.\n\nFaith Needed To Obey the Warning\n\nBy way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well.\n\nSimilarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark.\n\nThe faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive.\n\nIt has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too.\n\n(Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps)\n\nNo Visible Angels\n\nAnother reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively.\n\nI think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men.\n\n\"My pastor said not to go\"\n\nIt should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark.\n\nThen, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later).\n\nThe mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2.\n\nOption 3, of mark evasion, will have expired.\n\nWhy It's Not Already Here\n\nYou may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple.\n\nThat said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology.\n\n\"COVID Vaccines/Passports Are the Mark!\"\n\nAlong those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit:\n\nPeople say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666.\n\nSo you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one.\n\nWhat Do I Think the Mark Is?\n\nThen what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society.\n\nRev 13:17 — so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast’s name or the number of his name.\n\nConsidering that verse you can rule out a few things right off:\n\nThe mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that.\n\nIt always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying.

(That's another reason why Bitcoin/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit/debit card.\"\n\n: I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce.

If the mark is only an ID/currency account, then I doubt trade/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice.\n\nWhat I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce.\n\nAll that to say, when I consider the buying/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast.\n\nWhat To Do Today To Escape the Mark\n\nClearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions.\n\nThe question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know:\n\nLuke 18:8 (HCSB)— I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) — 5 The apostles said to the Lord, “ Increase our faith .” 6 “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed,” the Lord said, “you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) — But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”\n\nEver notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere.\n\nIn the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it.\n\nIf you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast.\n\nBy the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation.\n\nWhat Not To Do...\n\nLastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact.\n\nThe proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did.\n\nFor help on what aspects to focus on changing in your life, from Jesus' words, see my article on Rapture Requirements.\n\nP.S.

        "MSN quietly deleted a story revealing that severe COVID-19 is rarely found in the unvaccinated\n\nA research paper found that people who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine had a lower rate of suffering a severe case of the virus amidst the pandemic.\n\n(Article by Natalie Winters republished from TheNationalPulse.com)\n\nThe article, which has been uploaded to the preprint server ResearchGate, relied on data from over 18,500 respondents across 175 countries. Analysis revealed that individuals unvaccinated against COVID-19 reported fewer instances of hospitalization in comparison to their vaccinated counterparts.\n\nMSN – a news website launched by vaccine enthusiast Bill Gates’s Microsoft in 1995 – covered the study, titling its article “Severe COVID-19 ‘Rare’ In Unvaccinated People,” but appears to have taken down the story since its publication. Archived versions of the article are still available, however.\n\nThe survey – “Self-reported outcomes, choices and discrimination among a global COVID-19 unvaccinated cohort“– was conducted from September 2021 through February 2022. Data collected for the survey was analyzed by an independent, international team of scientists led by Robert Verkerk, Ph.D., the founder and executive and scientific director of Alliance for Natural Health International.\n\n“It is important to recognize that because the cohort represents a self-selected, as opposed to randomly selected, sample, the findings cannot be directly compared with other observational studies based on self-reported data based on randomly selected subjects,” emphasized the study.\n\nMany of the unvaccinated individuals included in the analysis opted for natural treatments such as vitamin D, zinc, quercetin, and drugs such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe study also found that people unvaccinated against COVID-19 faced discrimination for their decisions, with between 20 to 60 percent of people per country reporting being personal targets of “hate or victimization.”\n\n“Respondents reported feeling even more victimized by their respective states, with rates among respondents being greatest in Southern Europe (61%), Western Europe (59%), Australia and New Zealand (57%) and South America (57%),” explained the paper.\n\nThe survey follows additional studies reaching similar conclusions about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. A Koch Institute report assessing data from the German government, for example, found that 80 percent of cases of the Omicron variant occurred in fully vaccinated people in the country.\n\nRead more at: TheNationalPulse.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Media absurdly insists COVID shots are “safe and effective” as vaccine injuries and deaths mount\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for the corporate-controlled media, which now includes Big Tech’s social media platforms, to keep a lid on Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine” injuries and deaths.\n\nThe body count is mounting and all the propaganda mouthpieces can do is continue to scream safe and effective! whenever someone points out the facts. How much longer will this tactic work?\n\nThe answer is not for long because even people who formerly approved of the shots and even got jabbed themselves are beginning to ask serious questions that the establishment cannot answer. So, the establishment is just screaming the same false answer louder in the hope that it will stick.\n\n“Post-injection death tolls have reached levels that are making it very difficult for the powers-that-be to keep the lambs sleeping and the vaxx zealots enthused,” reported the Covid Blog.\n\n“Thus, they are resorting to the oldest, tried-and-true tricks in the book, particularly the ‘if you tell a lie enough, it becomes the truth’ method.”\n\nPolitifact, as one example, republished the same article the other day that it previously published declaring that both messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector DNA injections are in no way related to the massive uptick in sudden deaths that has been occurring ever since the launch of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nReuters, which is owned by Pfizer, is similarly regurgitating the same tired propaganda articles about how there is “no evidence” that Fauci Flu shots are killing people.\n\nThen we have FactCheck.org, which published an article back in early March claiming that COVID injections are somehow preventing deaths rather than causing them, and telling people to ignore a “misleading graphic on social media” that suggests otherwise.\n\nThese three fake news outlets, along with USA Today, have been very busy lately churning out the same parroted lies about Fauci Flu shots that we have been hearing since the beginning.\n\nWhen enough jabbed people die, perhaps the world will finally wake up – but it’ll already be too late\n\nTry as they might to deflect from the truth, the fake news brigade cannot hide the fact that “fully vaccinated” people all around the world are developing extreme illnesses or dropping dead for no apparent reason.\n\nThis was not a thing before Operation Warp Speed, by the way. Only since Donald Trump unleashed the jabs, followed by Joe Biden mandating them, has “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome” magically become a reality.\n\nThose who have developed a serious health condition themselves post-injection, or who know someone else who did, are unlikely to continue buying the fake news headlines telling them that the jabs had nothing to do with it.\n\nEven so, the jab zealots are showing no signs of stopping with the propaganda, and are instead doubling and tripling down on their false narratives. “Zionist of the Year” Albert Bourla, the current CEO of Pfizer, continues to make the rounds at elitist functions like World Economic Forum (WEF) gatherings to tout the “merits” of getting injected.\n\nBourla is also making routine appearances on fake news networks like CNN to push for more jab mandates, and to vilify the “unvaccinated” whom he believes are criminals – even as jabbed people everywhere continue to drop dead.\n\n“The foregoing propaganda campaigns keep vaxx zealots engaged, despite many of them now suffering from various adverse effects from the injections,” the Covid Blog reported.\n\n“Those are the unlucky ones. It’s becoming crystal clear that all vaxxed people will suddenly drop dead of a heart attack or cardiac arrest, or die in their sleep, at any moment. And it’s happening all over the world.”\n\nTo keep up with the latest news about COVID jab injuries and deaths, be sure to check out VaccineDeaths.com.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheCovidBlog.com\n\nNaturalNews.com 1\n\nNaturalNews.com 2\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "First FOOD goes, then the ECONOMY: Radical changes in the agriculture sector compounded by pandemic tyranny responsible for Sri Lanka’s demise\n\nEvery excuse under the sun is creeping out of the woodwork in an attempt to explain away why the global economy is unraveling. In Sri Lanka, where the economy has basically already collapsed, the latest excuse blames a government plan that sought to clean up the nation’s agriculture system.\n\nBack in 2021, a law was passed banning chemical fertilizers to help cut nitrogen waste and make food in Sri Lanka more organic. We are told that this “overnight shift,” to quote economist Peter Earle, drastically reduced crop yields and is somehow also responsible for widespread fuel shortages that have crippled the country’s economy.\n\nEarlier in the week, Sri Lanka’s prime minister declared that the country has now gone “bankrupt,” supposedly because of government efforts to promote organic farming last year (do they really expect people to believe such nonsense?).\n\n“Our economy has faced a complete collapse,” said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nPlandemic tyranny is what pushed Sri Lanka’s already delicate economic situation over the edge\n\nIt turns out that Sri Lanka’s problems go a lot further back than 2021 when it decided to take a positive step towards ridding the country of highly polluting and extremely unhealthy chemical agriculture.\n\nRewind back to early 2020 and it becomes clear that Sri Lanka’s compliance with the global trend of imposing lockdowns and business closures due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is what really did the country in, pushing it over the edge into economic oblivion.\n\nSri Lanka is a tourist-driven economy, in part, which was crushed when the world’s globalist overlords decided that everyone needs to stay home in order to “stay safe.” The country lost much of its foreign exchange reserves, which also damaged imports of fuel and other necessities.\n\nThis was followed by the chemical fertilizer ban, which appears to have greatly upset the chemical industry, quickly resulting in widespread loss of fuel and civil unrest.\n\nEarle, delivering a canned statement on behalf of Big Chemical and Big Agriculture, claims that chemical agriculture is part of Sri Lanka’s formerly more prosperous crop industry.\n\n“Agriculture is built not just on science, but it’s built on decades and centuries of trial and error and hard-won experience,” he said.\n\n“There’s a certain degree of know-how in markets and in certain areas where the government should defer to the expertise of people in markets, people who are practitioners, rather than letting bureaucrats rule.”\n\nIn some ways he might be right. An overnight shift was probably not the best way to go, but was it really the thing that is responsible for Sri Lanka’s current plight? Or perhaps a better way of wording that question might be: Did someone implement that law on purpose, at just the right time, to be the lynchpin in Sri Lanka’s undoing?\n\nAll around the world we are now seeing those lynchpins go off, much like the pin being pulled out of a grenade. The stage was set years ago for a total collapse of the global economy, and now the globalists are starting to pull all the pins at once, demonstrating their stranglehold over nearly all aspects of global commerce.\n\nNow they can use Sri Lanka as an example of why organic agriculture, supposedly “doesn’t work,” even though it does work when implemented correctly and with a proper timeline for conversion.\n\nKeep in mind that chemical agriculture is the thing through which Mystery Babylon built up its global empire of control and tyranny. Of course taking it away on a dime will lead to chaos and destruction, which seems to be precisely the intent.\n\nMore related news coverage about the implosion of the global economy can be found at Collapse.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nDailyCaller.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "British “watchdog” journalists unmasked as lap dogs for the security state\n\nLONDON – Events of the past few days suggest British journalism – the so-called Fourth Estate – is not what it purports to be: a watchdog monitoring the centers of state power. It is quite the opposite.\n\n(Article by Jonathan Cook republished from MintPressNews.com)\n\nThe pretensions of the establishment media took a severe battering this month as the defamation trial of Guardian columnist Carole Cadwalladr reached its conclusion and the hacked emails of Paul Mason, a long-time stalwart of the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian, were published online.\n\nBoth of these celebrated journalists have found themselves outed as recruits – in their differing ways – to a covert information war being waged by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nHad they been honest about it, that collusion might not matter so much. After all, few journalists are as neutral or as dispassionate as the profession likes to pretend. But as have many of their colleagues, Cadwalladr and Mason have broken what should be a core principle of journalism: transparency.\n\nThe role of serious journalists is to bring matters of import into the public space for debate and scrutiny. Journalists thinking critically aspire to hold those who wield power – primarily state agencies – to account on the principle that, without scrutiny, power quickly corrupts.\n\nThe purpose of real journalism – as opposed to the gossip, entertainment and national-security stenography that usually passes for journalism – is to hit up, not down.\n\nAnd yet, each of these journalists, we now know, was actively colluding, or seeking to collude, with state actors who prefer to operate in the shadows, out of sight. Both journalists were coopted to advance the aims of the intelligence services.\n\nAnd worse, each of them either sought to become a conduit for, or actively assist in, covert smear campaigns run by Western intelligence services against other journalists.\n\nWhat they were doing – along with so many other establishment journalists – is the very antithesis of journalism. They were helping to conceal the operation of power to make it harder to scrutinize. And not only that. In the process, they were trying to weaken already marginalized journalists fighting to hold state power to account.\n\nRUSSIAN COLLUSION?\n\nCadwalladr’s cooperation with the intelligence services has been highlighted only because of a court case. She was sued for defamation by Arron Banks, a businessman and major donor to the successful Brexit campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.\n\nIn a kind of transatlantic extension of the Russiagate hysteria in the United States following Donald Trump’s election as president in 2016, Cadwalladr accused Banks of lying about his ties to the Russian state. According to the court, she also suggested he broke election funding laws by receiving Russian money in the run-up to the Brexit vote, also in 2016.\n\nThat year serves as a kind of ground zero for liberals fearful about the future of “Western democracy” – supposedly under threat from modern “barbarians at the gate,” such as Russia and China – and the ability of Western states to defend their primacy through neo-colonial wars of aggression around the globe.\n\nThe implication is Russia masterminded a double subversion in 2016: on one side of the Atlantic, Trump was elected U.S. president; and, on the other, Britons were gulled into shooting themselves in the foot – and undermining Europe – by voting to leave the EU.\n\nFaced with the court case, Cadwalladr could not support her allegations against Banks as true. Nonetheless, the judge ruled against Banks’ libel action – on the basis that the claims had not sufficiently harmed his reputation.\n\nThe judge also decided, perversely in a British defamation action, that Cadwalladr had “reasonable grounds” to publish claims that Banks received “sweetheart deals” from Russia, even though “she had seen no evidence he had entered into any such deals.” An investigation by the National Crime Agency ultimately found no evidence either.\n\nSo given those circumstances, what was the basis for her accusations against Banks?\n\nCadwalladr’s journalistic modus operandi, in her long-running efforts to suggest widespread Russian meddling in British politics, is highlighted in her witness statement to the court.\n\nIn it, she refers to another of her Russiagate-style stories: one from 2017 that tried to connect the Kremlin with Nigel Farage, a former pro-Brexit politician with the UKIP Party and close associate of Banks, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been a political prisoner in the U.K. for more than a decade.\n\nAt that time, Assange was confined to a single room in the Ecuadorian Embassy after its government offered him political asylum. He had sought sanctuary there, fearing he would be extradited to the U.S. following publication by WikiLeaks of revelations that the U.S. and U.K. had committed war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nWikiLeaks had also deeply embarrassed the CIA by following up with the publication of leaked documents, known as Vault 7, exposing the agency’s own crimes.\n\nLast week the U.K.’s Home Secretary, Priti Patel, approved the very extradition to the U.S. that Assange feared and that drove him into the Ecuadorian embassy. Once in the U.S., he faces up to 175 years in complete isolation in a supermax jail.\n\nASSASSINATION PLOT\n\nWe now know, courtesy of a Yahoo News investigation, that through 2017 the CIA hatched various schemes to either assassinate Assange or kidnap him in one of its illegal “extraordinary rendition” operations, so he could be permanently locked up in the U.S., out of public view.\n\nWe can surmise that the CIA also believed it needed to prepare the ground for such a rogue operation by bringing the public on board. According to Yahoo’s investigation, the CIA believed Assange’s seizure might require a gun battle on the streets of London.\n\nIt was at this point, it seems, that Cadwalladr and the Guardian were encouraged to add their own weight to the cause of further turning public opinion against Assange.\n\nAccording to her witness statement, “a confidential source in [the] U.S.” suggested – at the very time the CIA was mulling over these various plots – that she write about a supposed visit by Farage to Assange in the embassy. The story ran in the Guardian under the headline “When Nigel Farage met Julian Assange.”\n\nIn the article, Cadwalladr offers a strong hint as to who had been treating her as a confidant: the one source mentioned in the piece is “a highly placed contact with links to U.S. intelligence.” In other words, the CIA almost certainly fed her the agency’s angle on the story.\n\nIn the piece, Cadwalladr threads together her and the CIA’s claims of “a political alignment between WikiLeaks’ ideology, UKIP’s ideology and Trump’s ideology.” Behind the scenes, she suggests, was the hidden hand of the Kremlin, guiding them all in a malign plot to fatally undermine British democracy.\n\nShe quotes her “highly placed contact” claiming that Farage and Assange’s alleged face-to-face meeting was necessary to pass information of their nefarious plot “in ways and places that cannot be monitored.”\n\nExcept of course, as her “highly placed contact” knew – and as we now know, thanks to exposes by the Grayzone website – that was a lie. In tandem with its plot to kill or kidnap Assange, the CIA illegally installed cameras inside, as well as outside, the embassy. His every move in the embassy was monitored – even in the toilet block.\n\nThe reality was that the CIA was bugging and videoing Assange’s every conversation in the embassy, even the face-to-face ones. If the CIA actually had a recording of Assange and Farage meeting and discussing a Kremlin-inspired plot, it would have found a way to make it public by now.\n\nFar more plausible is what Farage and WikiLeaks say: that such a meeting never happened. Farage visited the embassy to try to interview Assange for his LBC radio show but was denied access. That can be easily confirmed because by then the Ecuadorian embassy was allying with the U.S. and refusing Assange any contact with visitors apart from his lawyers.\n\nNonetheless, Cadwalladr concludes: “In the perfect storm of fake news, disinformation and social media in which we now live, WikiLeaks is, in many ways, the swirling vortex at the centre of everything.”\n\n‘SWIRLING VORTEX’\n\nThe Farage-Assange meeting story shows how the CIA and Cadwalladr’s agendas perfectly coincided in their very own “swirling vortex” of fake news and disinformation.\n\nShe wanted to tie the Brexit campaign to Russia and suggest that anyone who wished to challenge the liberal pieties that provide cover for the crimes committed by Western states must necessarily belong to a network of conspirators, on the left and the right, masterminded from Moscow.\n\nThe CIA and other Western intelligence agencies, meanwhile, wanted to deepen the public’s impression that Assange was a Kremlin agent – and that WikiLeaks’ exposure of the crimes committed by those same agencies was not in the public interest but actually an assault on Western democracy.\n\nAssange’s character assassination had already been largely achieved with the American public in the Russiagate campaign in the U.S. The intelligence services, along with the Democratic Party leadership, had crafted a narrative designed to obscure WikiLeaks’ revelations of election-fixing by Hillary Clinton’s camp in 2016 to prevent Bernie Sanders from winning the party’s presidential nomination. Instead they refocused the public’s attention on evidence-free claims that Russia had “hacked” the emails.\n\nFor Cadwalladr and the CIA, the fake-news story of Farage meeting Assange could be spun as further proof that both the “far left” and “far right” were colluding with Russia. Their message was clear: only centrists – and the national security state – could be trusted to defend democracy.\n\nFABRICATED STORY\n\nCadwalladr’s smear of Assange is entirely of a piece with the vilification campaign of WikiLeaks led by liberal media outlets to which she belongs. Her paper, the Guardian, has had Assange in its sights since its falling out with him over their joint publication of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs in 2010.\n\nA year after Cadwalladr’s smear piece, the Guardian would continue its cooperation with the intelligence services’ demonization of Assange by running an equally fabricated story – this time about a senior aide of Trump’s, Paul Manafort, and various unidentified “Russians” secretly meeting Assange in the embassy.\n\nThe story was so improbable it was ridiculed even at the time of publication. Again, the CIA’s illegal spying operation inside and outside the embassy meant there was no way Manafort or any “Russians” could have secretly visited Assange without those meetings being recorded. Nonetheless, the Guardian has never retracted the smear.\n\nOne of the authors of the article, Luke Harding, has been at the forefront of both the Guardian’s Russiagate claims and its efforts to defame Assange. In doing so, he appears to have relied heavily on Western intelligence services for his stories and has proven incapable of defending them when challenged.\n\nHarding, like the Guardian, has an added investment in discrediting Assange. He and a Guardian colleague, David Leigh, published a Guardian-imprint book that included a secret password to a WikiLeaks’ cache of leaked documents, thereby providing security services around the world with access to the material.\n\nThe CIA’s claim that the release of those documents endangered its informants – a claim that even U.S. officials have been forced to concede is not true – has been laid at Assange’s door to vilify him and justify his imprisonment. But if anyone is to blame, it is not Assange but Harding, Leigh and the Guardian.\n\nEFFORT TO DEPLATFORM\n\nThe case of Paul Mason, who worked for many years as a senior BBC journalist, is even more revealing. Emails passed to the Grayzone website show the veteran, self-described “left-wing” journalist secretly conspiring with figures aligned with British intelligence services to build a network of journalists and academics to smear and censor independent media outlets that challenge the narratives of the Western intelligence agencies.\n\nMason’s concerns about left-wing influence on public opinion have intensified the more he has faced criticism from the left over his demands for fervent, uncritical support of NATO and as he has lobbied for greater Western interference in Ukraine. Both are aims he shares with Western intelligence services.\n\nAlong with the establishment media, Mason has called for sending advanced weaponry to Kyiv, likely to raise the death toll on both sides of the war and risk a nuclear confrontation between the West and Russia.\n\nIn the published emails, Mason suggests the harming and “relentless deplatforming” of independent investigative media sites – such as the Grayzone, Consortium News and Mint Press – that host non-establishment journalists. He and his correspondents also debate whether to include Declassified UK and OpenDemocracy. One of his co-conspirators suggests a “full nuclear legal to squeeze them financially.”\n\nMason himself proposes starving these websites of income by secretly pressuring Paypal to stop readers from being able to make donations to support their work.\n\nIt should be noted that, in the wake of Mason’s correspondence, PayPal did indeed launch just such a crackdown, including against Consortium News and MintPress, after earlier targeting WikiLeaks.\n\nMason’s email correspondents include two figures intimately tied to British intelligence: Amil Khan is described by the Grayzone as “a shadowy intelligence contractor” with ties to the U.K.’s National Security Council. He founded Valent Projects, establishing his credentials in a dirty propaganda war in support of head-chopping jihadist groups trying to bring down the Russian-supported Syrian government.\n\nCLANDESTINE ‘CLUSTERS’\n\nThe other intelligence operative is someone Mason refers to as a “friend”: Andy Pryce, the head of the Foreign Office’s shadowy Counter Disinformation and Media Development (CDMD) unit, founded in 2016 to “counter-strike against Russian propaganda.” Mason and Pryce spend much of their correspondence discussing when to meet up in London pubs for a drink, according to the Grayzone.\n\nThe Foreign Office managed to keep the CDMD unit’s existence secret for two years. The U.K. government has refused to disclose basic information about the CDMD on grounds of national security, although it is now known that it is overseen by the National Security Council.\n\nThe CDMD’s existence came to light because of leaks about another covert information warfare operation, the Integrity Initiative.\n\nNotably, the Integrity Initiative was run on the basis of clandestine “clusters,” in North America and Europe, of journalists, academics, politicians and security officials advancing narratives shared with Western intelligence agencies to discredit Russia, China, Julian Assange, and Jeremy Corbyn, the former, left-wing leader of the Labor Party.\n\nCadwalladr was named in the British cluster, along with other prominent journalists: David Aaronovitch and Dominic Kennedy of the Times; the Guardian’s Natalie Nougayrede and Paul Canning; Jonathan Marcus of the BBC; the Financial Times’ Neil Buckley; the Economist’s Edward Lucas; and Sky News’ Deborah Haynes.\n\nIn his emails, Mason appears to want to renew this type of work but to direct its energies more specifically at damaging independent, dissident media – with his number one target the Grayzone, which played a critical role in exposing the Integrity Initiative.\n\nMason’s “friend” – the CDMD’s head, Andy Pryce – “featured prominently” in documents relating to the Integrity Initiative, the Grayzone observes.\n\nThis background is not lost on Mason. He notes in his correspondence the danger that his plot to “deplatform” independent media could “end up with the same problem as Statecraft” – a reference to the Institute of Statecraft, the Integrity Initiative’s parent charity, which the Grayzone and others exposed. He cautions: “The opposition are not stupid, they can spot an info op – so the more this is designed to be organic the better.”\n\nPryce and Mason discuss creating an astroturf civil-society organization that would lead their “information war” as part of an operation they brand the “International Information Brigade”.\n\nMason suggests the suspension of the libel laws for what he calls “foreign agents” – presumably meaning that the Information Brigade would be able to defame independent journalists as Russian agents, echoing the establishment media’s treatment of Assange, without fear of legal action that would show these were evidence-free smears.\n\n‘PUTIN INFOSPHERE’\n\nAnother correspondent, Emma Briant, an academic who claims to specialize in Russian disinformation, offers an insight into how she defines the presumed enemy within: those “close to WikiLeaks,” anyone “trolling Carole [Cadwalladr],” and outlets “discouraging people from reading the Guardian.”\n\nMason himself produces an eye-popping, self-drawn, spider’s web chart of the supposedly “pro-Putin infosphere” in the U.K., embracing much of the left, including Corbyn, the Stop the War movement, as well as the Black and Muslim communities. Several media sites are mentioned, including Mint Press and Novara Media, an independent British website sympathetic to Corbyn.\n\nKhan and Mason consider how they can help trigger a British government investigation of independent outlets so that they can be labeled as “Russian-state affiliated media” to further remove them from visibility on social media.\n\nMason states that the goal is to prevent the emergence of a “left anti-imperialist identity,” which, he fears, “will be attractive because liberalism doesn’t know how to counter it” – a telling admission that he believes genuine left-wing critiques of Western foreign policy cannot be dealt with through public refutation but only through secret disinformation campaigns.\n\nHe urges efforts to crack down not only on independent media and “rogue” academics but on left-wing political activism. He identifies as a particular threat Corbyn, who was earlier harmed through a series of disinformation campaigns, including entirely evidence-free claims that the Labour Party during his tenure became a hotbed of antisemitism. Mason fears Corbyn might set up a new, independent left-wing party. It is important, Mason notes, to “quarantine” and “stigmatize” any such ideology.\n\nIn short, rather than use journalism to win the argument and the battle for public opinion, Mason wishes to use the dark arts of the security state to damage independent media, as well as dissident academics and left-wing political activism. He wants no influences on the public that are not tightly aligned with the core foreign policy goals of the national security state.\n\nMason’s correspondence hints at the reality behind Cadwalladr’s claim that Assange was the “swirling vortex at the centre of everything.” Assange symbolizes that “swirling vortex” to intelligence-aligned establishment journalists only because WikiLeaks has published plenty of insider information that exposes Western claims to global moral leadership as a complete charade – and the journalists who amplify those claims as utter charlatans.\n\nIn part two, we will examine why journalists like Mason and Cadwalladr prosper in the establishment media; the long history of collusion between Western intelligence agencies and the establishment media; and how that mutually beneficial collusion is becoming ever more important to each of them.\n\nRead more at: MintPressNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Giving COVID-19 vaccines to INFANTS is unprecedented, despite mainstream media claims to the contrary\n\nGiving experimental and deadly Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines to infants is unprecedented.\n\n“The mainstream media has made it seem like, ‘Oh, we’re just one of many countries that is taking this step to protect our children from a terrible virus that they have a less than one percent chance of having any major issue with,'” said Kristi Leigh of InfoWars. “I mean, obviously they don’t add that last [piece of information], but they make it seem like this is no big deal, that everybody’s doing it.” (Related: Overwhelming evidence suggests giving children COVID-19 vaccines will only harm them.)\n\nA 12-member advisory panel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently voted unanimously to recommend the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines for children between six months to five years old.\n\n“We’ve taken a major step forward today,” said Dr. Oliver Brooks, a member of the committee.\n\nHours later, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky gave the final signoff. This made roughly 18 million kids eligible for vaccinations.\n\n“We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated, and with today’s decision, they can,” said Walensky in a statement.\n\nThe federal government is already gearing up for the expansion of vaccine distribution. It has ordered millions of additional doses for distribution to doctors, hospitals, clinics and other community health centers around the country.\n\nEvery state, except Florida, has already preordered millions of vaccines earmarked for children from the federal government.\n\nOnly a handful of countries vaccinate children under five\n\nFollowing Walensky’s approval, the United States became one of just a handful of countries that are currently vaccinating children under five, including Argentina, Bahrain, Chile, China, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Hong Kong also provides vaccines for children under five.\n\nThe fact that seven other countries and Hong Kong provide vaccines to children under five has been used by mainstream media outlets to push the claim that America’s new policy is not particularly unique.\n\nBut when this claim is dissected, it is found that most of the countries are only vaccinating children as young as three. Cuba and Venezuela allow children as young as two to get vaccinated.\n\nFurthermore, none of the other nations that vaccinate children younger than five use mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in a massive scale. Five out of the seven countries listed above use China’s inactivated vaccines. Cuba and Venezuela use the former’s protein subunit vaccine.\n\nThe United States is the first and only country to give vaccines to infants as young as six months, according to President Joe Biden.\n\n“We are the first country to protect our youngest children with COVID-19 vaccines, offering safe and highly effective mRNA doses to children as young as six months old,” said Biden in a statement. “My administration secured vaccine doses for America’s youngest children and now with the FDA’s [Food and Drug Administration’s] authorization, we will begin shipping millions of vaccine doses for kids to thousands of locations parents know and trust – including pediatricians’ offices, children’s hospitals and pharmacies.”\n\nData shows that children are relatively safe from COVID-19. But with the mRNA vaccines, they are not.\n\nLearn more about the harmful effects of COVID-19 vaccines on children at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this clip from the “War Room” on InfoWars as host Kristi Leigh talks about how giving vaccines to infants is unprecedented.\n\nThis video can be found in the channel InfoWars on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nGENOCIDE: FDA officially authorizes covid vaccines for children as young as 6 months.\n\nFDA committee says children as young as six need to take Moderna’s COVID injections.\n\nFully vaccinated children suffer multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nStudy: COVID vaccination causes vaccine-associated enhanced disease in children.\n\nAll-cause death rate 52 times higher among vaccinated children than unvaccinated children.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nInfoWars.com\n\nAPNews.com\n\nNature.com\n\n\n\nDossier.Substack.com\n\nUSNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "DeSantis vindicated of COVID cover-up after media darling, ‘whistleblower’ ends up in complete disgrace\n\nWhat a surprise: Rebekah Jones, once hailed as a “whistleblower” for claiming Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis had fudged the state’s COVID-19 numbers, has been revealed as a complete fraud.\n\n(Article by C. Douglas Golden republished from WesternJournal.com)\n\nA report released last week by the Florida Department of Health Office of Inspector General exonerated DeSantis on the allegations and found nothing to back up Jones’ allegations that she’d been pressured to alter COVID-19 case and death counts. In fact, the people the inspector general’s office talked to couldn’t even make sense out of the allegations, considering Jones didn’t have access to the raw coronavirus data.\n\n(In spite of this, the mainstream media is hardly handling the report with the same breathlessness they handled the accusations against DeSantis — and for obvious reasons. At a time when trust in the mainstream media is at a low, we here at The Western Journal bring you news and analysis you won’t hear in the mainstream press. If you like and support our work, please consider subscribing.)\n\nAccording to an editorial published Friday by The Wall Street Journal, the inspector general found no evidence to support Jones’ claims.\n\n“Based upon an analysis of the available evidence, there is insufficient evidence to clearly support a violation of a law, rule, or policy, as described by the complainant,” the report stated.\n\nThe governor’s office argued that Jones was fired from her job for “insubordination” and “unilateral decisions to modify the Department’s COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors.”\n\nJones’ original allegations were that she had been ordered to tidy up COVID numbers to support the state’s reopening in the spring of 2020. In addition, she claimed the governor had retaliated against her by having the Florida Department of Law Enforcement execute a search warrant against her in December 2020, arguing DeSantis had “sent the Gestapo” to keep her quiet.\n\nPolice say the raid involved a data breach that was traced back to Jones’ home IP address. She’s been hit with a felony charge for downloading confidential health department data. She has pleaded innocent.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the inspector general’s office talked to over a dozen individuals who worked with Jones as part of its investigation, including her superiors — and not a single one supported her allegations of fudged data.\n\nWhile she told some of her co-workers that she was told to alter COVID data in the system, the report said they didn’t buy her allegations. That wasn’t just because of her inherent unreliability but because of the fact she didn’t have access to the pertinent data. Instead, she was in charge of handling the state’s online dashboard, not the raw data.\n\n“If the complainant or other DOH staff were to have falsified COVID-19 data on the dashboard, the dashboard would then not have matched the data in the corresponding final daily report,” the report said.\n\n“Such a discrepancy would have been detectable by [Bureau of Epidemiology] staff conducting data quality assurance, as well as other parties, both within and outside the DOH, including but not limited to [county health departments], local governments, researchers, the press/media, and the general public.”\n\nInstead, the report stated the inspector general’s office “found no evidence that the DOH misrepresented or otherwise misled the public regarding how positivity rates were calculated,” according to the report.\n\n“The definitions for overall and new case positivity were provided on the Data Definition sheet and Health Metrics Overview, which were both linked to the dashboard, and were consistent with testimonial evidence obtained by the OIG.”\n\nThe report appeared last week to nary a peep in the same media outlets that loved her back in the febrile days of the early pandemic.\n\nAs The Daily Caller noted, Jones was a frequent guest on Joy Reid’s MSNBC’s show and made at least five appearances on former CNN host Chris Cuomo’s old show. (No lack of sad irony there; Cuomo’s brother Andrew, the erstwhile governor of New York, was forced out of office over sexual harassment allegations, but also faced accusations of covering up COVID deaths in the state’s nursing homes.)\n\nThe headlines in liberal media outlets were similarly effusive — calling Jones a “scientist” to buttress her standing, like Jones was filling test tubes with potential coronavirus vaccines when she wasn’t trying to expose fraud in the Florida government. But even CNN has been honest enough to qualify that as “data scientist.”\n\nNPR, May 19, 2020: “Florida Dismisses A Scientist For Her Refusal To Manipulate State’s Coronavirus Data.” South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Dec. 10, 2020: “FDLE raid dramatizes Florida’s COVID-19 coverup.” HuffPo, Dec. 17, 2020: “Florida Scientist Vows To Speak COVID-19 ‘Truth To Power’ Despite Police Raid.” Cosmopolitan, March 11, 2021: “Rebekah Jones Tried To Warn Us About COVID-19. How Her Freedom Is On The Line.”\n\nNo evidence for any of it. None. Goose egg. Zero-point-zero.\n\nRebekah Jones was a darling of the mainstream media if just because her wild-eyed conspiracy theories about covering up COVID data could be wielded as a cudgel against Ron DeSantis and others considered a threat to progressives.\n\nAs always, the allegations appear on page one; the truth on page 17 — if it appears at all. She’s served her purpose.\n\nRead more at: WesternJournal.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Mainstream media outlets in damage control as more Americans get sick and die after taking COVID-19 vaccines\n\nAmerican mainstream media outlets are working overtime to push out stories claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines and boosters are effective when the reality is proving the opposite.\n\n“The propaganda spinning immediately began as soon as the data began to show those who have been injected several times are not doing nearly as well as those who have refrained from taking the shots,” wrote Mac Slavo for SHTF Plan. “The mainstream media wants you to know that it isn’t the booster shots that are increasing the risk of getting COVID.” (Related: Patrick Gunnels tells Dr. Lee Merritt: Americans are the most gaslit people in the world when it comes to vaccines – Brighteon.TV.)\n\nAlexander Tin, writing for CBS News, tried to claim that the rising hospitalization and death rates in American hospitals do not mean the booster vaccines are ineffective or that they somehow increase the risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\n“Ongoing studies continue to provide strong evidence of additional protection offered by booster shots against infection, severe disease and death,” wrote Tin.\n\nInstead, what CBS News is offering as a supposed justification for the sudden increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, is that the vaccines simply aren’t meant to prevent infections, merely lower the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJohn Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, spoke to CBS News and admitted that the omicron variant, which mainstream media outlets fearmongered months ago, can still break through the antibody protections supposedly provided by COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBut Moore added that fully vaccinated and boosted individuals who still contract breakthrough infections will only experience mild infections. He also went on to blame people for believing that they’re protected by the vaccine.\n\n“So, one of the dynamics here is that people feel, after vaccination and boosting, that they’re more protected than they actually are, so they increase their risks,” he said. “That, I think, is the major driver of these statistics.”\n\nGovernment still pushing for more vaccinations\n\nSome of the data are too remarkable even for mainstream media outlets to deny. Information from the federal government shows that COVID-19 cases are on the uptick once again, but this time more of these new cases are coming from vaccinated and boosted Americans.\n\nFurthermore, the data also shows that more and more fully vaccinated individuals are making up the number of people dying of COVID-19.\n\nBut despite media outlets admitting to this, government health officials still claim the best option for people is to get vaccinated and boosted.\n\n“Almost no one in this country should be dying from COVID” if only they get vaccinated and take their boosters, claimed Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during an appearance on CNN. “What we really should be worried about is getting the boosters that we need to stay up to date so with the new variants that we have, we don’t have the unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.”\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, also claimed that a surge is coming this fall and winter and the only way to prevent it is to get more Americans vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.\n\n“It’s really important that we try to get the half – or a little bit more than half – of Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,” he said, during a different appearance on CNN. “That may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we’re coming into yet another wave of COVID-19.”\n\nWatch this episode of the “Health Ranger Report” as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about the sudden uptick in people who are fully vaccinated, but who are either dying or dead.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nDr. Zelenko shares how the MSM smeared him for revealing the cure to COVID – Brighteon.TV.\n\nIt’s Kristallnacht again, as “our free press” ramps up its war on the “unvaccinated.”\n\nNew head of left-leaning Toronto Star said last year she opposes COVID vaccine passports in now-deleted tweet.\n\nWSJ misleads public on ivermectin, ignores latest revelations about ‘hidden author’ who undermined its efficacy.\n\nSources include:\n\nSHTFPlan.com\n\nCBSNews.com\n\nEdition.CNN.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "On Wednesday 22 June 2022, the United Kingdom declared a national incident after vaccine-induced poliovirus was found in sewage samples in North and East London. Wild polio currently exists in only two countries—Pakistan and Afghanistan—and was declared eradicated in the UK in 2003. We are told that positive sewage tests have been found since February 2022, which would suggest that scientists are looking at a hypothesis of ‘ongoing transmission’ around the country.\n\nBut is polio the only unusual virus detected in the UK in the last six months, and was it entirely unexpected? Is it sheer coincidence that our very own MHRA is collaborating with the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication Initiative and houses its polio laboratory at the heart of Britain's medicines regulation complex, at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?\n\nNot surprising\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), in a March 2019 blog post written when the agency was still designated as Public Health England, warned that a resurgence of Victorian diseases was expected—and that is exactly what we appear to be seeing now, according to current press releases. Professor Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, describes what we are seeing as ‘chatter’. ‘Chatter’ is the term regularly used by counter-terrorist officers (a not insignificant context, given that the UKHSA’s new name combines the concepts of public health and national security) to describe the small signals that may signify some more major calamity on the horizon. Infectious disease prevention works in much the same way as counter-terrorism. Currently, we are being alerted that ‘chatter’ is getting louder; perhaps this increased volume stems from the heightened awareness of the risks since Covid-19. Even though we have seen the world strengthen its security systems, the world’s best-known public health official, Professor Anthony Fauci, warns of a new ‘pandemic era’.\n\nScabies, rickets, scarlet fever, whooping cough, tuberculosis and typhoid fever, amongst others, are returning to Western nations—but not as we remember them. Some of these old terrors will return with a vengeance, as a new variant or strain. Will our old-fashioned belt-and-braces medications that we have come to rely on for so long be effective, if they even prove to be widely available? What is driving the spread of new, old and existing viruses—or is it simply that we are searching every corner of the planet expecting to track down the next pandemic—a case of seek and ye shall find? Perhaps we should brace ourselves, as the blame for resurgent infections is likely to be attributed in public discourse to a variety of reasons: climate change, population growth, rainforest destruction, intense farming, the increased trade in wildlife combined with the exponential rise in zoonotic disease.\n\nAs the United Kingdom has been extricating itself from the European Union, non-EU immigration has increased, with large numbers of people travelling to and from Africa and Asia. Despite a couple of years of draconian travel restrictions and Covid lock-ups (sic), travel is still always named as the biggest driver of disease importations. The recent outbreak of monkeypox has been linked to Nigeria, with many more cases attributed to music festivals, adult saunas and orgies around the world. The 2022 British polio outbreak is thought to have been derived from another country, one which still uses a vaccine containing a live weakened strain of the polio virus; this is why the health authorities are describing the strain of poliovirus that they have detected in London as ‘vaccine-derived’. The UK itself has not used this particular vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, since 2004; we have reverted to the injectable Salk vaccine for our polio immunisations.\n\nMany would care to argue that polio has been given the perfect opportunity to reappear due to the Covid-19 pandemic, because of increased vaccine hesitancy and a major shift towards funding Covid-19 campaigns at the expense of other precious public health resources. Furthermore, disruptions to normal childhood immunisation schedules due to lock-ups, and a failure to provide face-to-face appointments with health professionals, will no doubt have contributed to the opportunity for polio. In the UK, vaccine administration to children has decreased in the past couple of years, especially in parts of London.\n\nOver-informed\n\nPharmaceutical research is currently travelling at a million miles an hour, with ‘information cascades’ bubbling with details of the thousands of novel drugs currently in development. This massive volume of information is designed to confuse and overwhelm the general population. As genomic medicines travel down the brand new experimental pipeline at the speed of light, many will relax and participate in clinical trials from the comfort of their armchairs, and millions will come to expect and to rely on brand new drugs which will be delivered in record speed to their door (probably by drone). The norm will be a much shorter delay between demand and delivery. The 100 Days Mission announced by Britain, the vision of Sir Patrick Vallance and Melinda Gates, would appear to be the answer. To put that into context, until 2020 a clinical trial would take years in three back-to-back phases, up to a timescale of 3,652 days. The first Covid vaccine was delivered in 300 days.\n\nGeneric medicines that the majority of us are used to will start to disappear from pharmacy shelves. Novel ‘super-smart’ genomic medicines will replace them at alarming speed—but at what cost to our health? Does anyone supplying them actually care? Looking at the serious adverse reactions thus far, it seems not.\n\nThe new buzzphrase that we will have to get used to will be antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Fortunately for Britain, we have our very own UK Envoy for AMR, in the form of Dame Sally Davies, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge—England’s previous Chief Medical Officer, who was responsible for Generation Genome.\n\nWhat is AMR anyway, and should we be concerned? According to the World Health Organisation, AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of severe illness and death. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial therapies become ineffective, making infectious diseases impossible to treat. The world has neglected to research new antibiotics. Is that an oversight or a deliberate omission at a high level?\n\nWith no new antibiotics riding to our rescue in this heralded pandemic era, many will find themselves reliant on new experimental heavy-duty cocktails. Those wishing to opt out of the new pharmaceutical armoury that is offered to them will undoubtedly move away from allopathic medicine entirely and opt for alternative naturopathic remedies. New variants of concern, mutants and more virulent viruses will call for super-smart medicine—but not necessarily super-smart patients or super-smart medics.\n\nBut ultimately, where does that leave us all? What to expect next—Marburg, polio, typhoid, Ebola, Nipah, or perhaps a combination of several? Could we be about to see the elusive Disease X that experts have been warning of? Time will tell. Pandemics create panic and pandemonium; they can even open Pandora’s box."

        "We publish the below anonymously for self-evident reasons.\n\nI wrote an article for UK Column a year ago which accused legacy media newspaper proprietors of being criminally negligent for allowing Covid disinformation and fear-based propaganda in their titles.\n\nSince that time, levels of hatred have increased against journalists who operate in this industry that I myself have been part of for a quarter of a century.\n\nIn this second anonymous whistleblower account of what it is like to work in UK newspapers during the Covid era, I hope to direct some of that hatred away from the journalists and to refocus it on the newspaper industry chiefs who serve Big Pharma before truth.\n\nCensorship? What censorship?\n\nNearly all of the journalists I know are completely unaware of global censorship; they are often new in their roles and are thrust into a working world of increasingly aggressive public relations officers.\n\nOne community reporter, whom I class as a friend, listened to my concerns about tech giants censoring scientists and health professionals who went against World Health Organisation guidelines for the alleged pandemic. This reporter’s wages are paid for by Facebook, so I was expecting they would be aware of this, but they responded with: “Oh, I didn’t know.”\n\nAdd to this ignorance the chronic levels of understaffing we endure, with redundancies being announced most years across all editorial departments, and we have an industry where press releases are pumped out without challenge.\n\nAs an example of this, I had one editor ask me to upload directly onto our newspaper website an NHS press release urging pregnant women to take the Covid injection, as it was “safe and effective”. This same editor was too fearful to return to the office early this year, even though others were coming back in, so I genuinely believe the editor thought the press release was nothing more than legitimate public health advice.\n\nIn sum, the entire backbone has been ripped out of the news industry—and that happened more than a decade ago.\n\nAnd we are dealing with clueless individuals who work within it, many of them programmed to be “woke” by their “trusted” news sources like the BBC and the Guardian, but do they deserve our hate and scorn?\n\nAt the time of writing my last whistleblower account, I was angry, frustrated and scared about where the world was heading and how my industry was pushing it there. I hated my colleagues for their ignorance and their blind faith in authority.\n\nBut after another year of continuing to take pay cheques from what I still believe is the PR unit for globalist billionaires, I have become sorry for these foot soldiers who have caused so much harm by failing to challenge authority. And I fear for them as well.\n\nBewitched\n\nIt won’t be long before a British journalist is physically hurt (if it hasn’t happened already) for their role in what has happened in the Covid era, and I have experienced some of this public hatred towards journalists myself.\n\nDuring a recent public meeting highlighting the documented life-changing harm and death caused by the Pfizer Covid injections, I had some audience members turn on me, shouting that I was a disgrace and that I should quit my job when I announced that I worked in the mainstream media.\n\nIf it had not been for a senior local politician, who knows me, speaking up for my integrity, I would have had to have made a sharp exit for my own safety.\n\nThe mainstream news has become one of the country's most hated professions during the last two years, especially among those who have either recently learned or already knew not to trust authority on global issues.\n\nHaving now returned to the office on a sporadic basis, I have had the chance to speak face-to-face with colleagues for the first time in more than a year—and it has dawned on me how ignorant they are. They are not stupid, they are not controlled opposition, they are not just being told what to write, they are just completely unaware of any counter-narratives about Covid.\n\nThey are under a spell, a spell of remarkable simplicity that has just two elements—censorship and propaganda—which brings about the end product of fear.\n\nMost of my colleagues are fairly low down in the editorial structure of the global mainstream behemoth, but they represent a microcosm of what is happening further along the corridors of power. This hierarchical consideration goes some way to explain the absolute ignorance among those reporting the news.\n\nThere is a handful of my colleagues who are aware that the human race is being railroaded into a new world order controlled by technocrats. A few others are starting to realise that politicians have no problems lying to us about the most important global issues.\n\nThis second group, although aware of something bad happening around them, recoil at the thought of a global conspiracy to enslave humanity. When discussing Covid, especially, they make it clear they do not subscribe to conspiracy theories and are not conspiracy theorists.\n\nThese comments are made because they are fearful their reputations could be harmed by discussing Covid through the lens of holding authority to account, following the money, and asking who benefits. I have noticed that mainstream media managers are far more fearful of being branded a “conspiracy theorist” than a reporter. And I know of one reporter who was branded the “office conspiracy theorist” for writing an article detailing a woman’s Covid injection harm.\n\nSome of my colleagues I also count as friends, and many of them I still have not seen since our offices were shut down across the country more than two years ago.\n\nBut recently we have been returning to our desks—which we have to book online beforehand—and this has allowed me to be able to speak to some of them and to look them in the eye as I hear their thoughts about what has been going on.\n\nIt has been a shocking experience, and disheartening. The propaganda pumped out by the Government, and regurgitated by the national newspapers and television news networks, has done a good job of scaring them—to such an extent that real psychological trauma has been caused to some of them. Several colleagues have admitted to me they are “pro-vax” and are worried about any \"messaging\" that could reduce Covid injection uptake. Another just felt it was their “civic duty” to receive all their injections, and thought no more about it. One colleague even messaged me to urge me to be injected, as they were so worried for my wellbeing.\n\nSome months later, I provided that colleague with evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the increased levels of death among those who did get injected, and I urged them not to continue taking any Covid boosters offered. I received no response.\n\nCloud of unknowing\n\nMore shocking examples of ignorance came from a colleague who told me how fortunate it was that a reporter we worked with had been triple injected, as they had become seriously ill with Covid. No connection between the injections and becoming ill was made.\n\nThis same colleague had written an opinion piece some months earlier, pleading with people to continue taking their Covid injections, despite referencing a report of a woman dying in agony from blood clots—after being injected—which featured in that same day’s newspaper. Is this cognitive dissonance? Mass formation? I don’t pretend to know, but it is isolating and lonely to be working among these people who are so programmed by the television news. And they certainly do not like be challenged about their beliefs. I have done it, and have been victimised for it.\n\nOne seasoned reporter who prided themselves on knowing the ways of the world was talking to me about the alleged pandemic. I asked them what they knew about midazolam, and they replied they had never heard of it.\n\nThis censorship in the legacy media has left my colleagues and former colleagues blissfully unaware of Covid counter-narratives. Some truly believe in Bill Gates as a charitable benefactor for humanity and Chris Whitty as a responsible scientist looking to help guide the UK out of troubled waters.\n\nThey are living in a different reality to myself and do not want to dip their toes in the information streams of those who disagree with them so fundamentally. As one colleague recently told me, they only get their information on global affairs from the mainstream media. I told her I didn’t get any of my information on global affairs from the mainstream media.\n\nThe conversation ended there. We were both so wrapped up in our own worlds that to even engage in debate with someone who thought so differently would be too uncomfortable.\n\nThese types of people who build their understanding of the world from the television, radio and mainstream newspapers do not just work in the mainstream media. They exist in health, education, politics, councils, entertainment, sport, church, you name it. Whatever the sector of employment, there are people who trust those with the loudest microphones.\n\nBut in the mainstream news, there are more of these people; a lot more. Careers in this industry depend on consuming other mainstream outlets: especially so at a local level, where “news sense” is guided by what the national news is saying.\n\nVictims\n\nSo here I am, a journalist of 25 years who has worked only in the mainstream news arena. I have been unable to wake up the vast majority of colleagues and have withdrawn into my shell, apart from occasional spats with them over e-mail or, on rare occasions, in person.\n\nI know what is going on in the world and they don’t. I have been restricted from writing about what I know about, or even to ask questions of authority that my editor does not want asked.\n\nI am not giving up, though; I am not walking away. I am staying at my post, as I know things are very likely to get worse; and when things get worse, more of my colleagues will start waking up, and I’ll be here to guide them and point them towards official documents that they will know nothing about, since the national newspapers and the broadcast news have chosen to ignore them. Ask a journalist about what they know about PCR test cycle rates or a SPI-B Government document recommending the use fear-based propaganda in the media to turn civilians against each other, and you will just get a blank stare.\n\nA friend consoled me recently that the way to bring down an edifice of unchecked control that operates under the power of censorship and propaganda is to set just one mouse gnawing away at the foundations.\n\nEventually, that one mouse becomes two, and then four, then eight, and so on. That is how we get out of this mess, from the bottom of whatever corporate pyramid we operate in. There is no point in hoping for change from above: as I can tell you with absolute certainty, and experience, it is not coming. Journalists whom I work with, trust, and respect, and have known for years are just as clueless about Covid now as they were at the start of 2020.\n\nDon’t hate them; feel sorry for them. They are victims in all this.\n\nI concluded my last UK Column article with a plea: a plea to those who made the editorial decisions, to allow for debate. That plea was never answered, but I make another plea now, to the reporters, to those venturing out of the office to speak to those in authority, building contacts and getting the stories. (And above all else, keep an open mind.) My plea is this:\n\nPlease, please, do not be afraid of asking difficult questions, and make it your business to seek out information that is being censored and then to decide for yourself whether that information has any validity.\n\nThe fight against tyranny has to come from the bottom, not the top. Don’t wait for a knight in shining armour; there isn’t one coming. It is up to you—the coalface journalist—to get out there and hold authority to account. And then, perhaps, our industry will become less hated than it is today; it could even become a profession again."

Most recently, Shoemaker worked throughout 2020 to 2022 providing direct patient care at an Ottawa COVID care clinic and was part of the Eastern Ontario COVID-19 Response Team.\n\nHesitant to refer to the COVID injections as vaccines, Dr. Shoemaker joins other global experts in calling for a global end to the COVID injectables.\n\nHe sounds the alarm on Pfizer’s own documents — only released as per a court order after the FDA tried to suppress the data for 75 years — which show that out of 29 outcomes in pregnant women, 28 resulted in the loss/death of the baby.\n\nShoemaker refers to the overall response as a “travesty” which is further compounded by physicians being stripped of their ability to prescribe early treatment options. He says that “doctors could try an off-label drug, usually, for their patients, prior to 2020.”\n\nReferring back to U.S. military documents uncovered by Project Veritas that confirm the safety and efficacy of early treatment drugs, the documents also show alarming findings around the development of Sars-Cov-2.\n\nWhen questioned about his only recent dissenting, Shoemaker pauses to remind me, “I’m a doctor, I’m trying to save peoples lives and I know that these pseudo-vaccines, these genomic bio-agents only create immune damage. I’ve seen it, I’ve read it. I’ve seen what’s happening in Israel where their population is developing VAEDS — a Vaccine Associated Enhanced Disease state where people are going into the ER and ICU and dying with AIDS-like loss of immune function, AIDS-like parasites taking over their bodies, neurologic consequences, all because the vaccines are so toxic.”\n\nTo drive this point home, concerning findings emerge as more data continues to be collected around the safety (or lack thereof) profile of the COVID injections in Britain. A dissection of official government data showed that children were 52 times more likely to die following a COVID shot. Shoemaker gives context to this by comparing it to a utility bill: “If your internet bill goes up 5200%, from $200/month to $10,400 — it’s a pretty crass example — but it’s a huge number, a horrible number.”\n\n“Parents are burying 16- and 17-year-olds because this vaccine causes vascular endotheliitis and children die in their sleep or they die playing soccer or hockey,” Shoemaker cautions.\n\nCoupled with the ~1% efficacy as per an absolute risk reduction analysis, Shoemaker asks “if a medication is doing that much harm, how can it possibly be continued?\""

        "It’s April 2020, and since March, the UK has swiftly commissioned and built vast, temporary, intensive care hospitals, in readiness for a predicted epidemic number of severe COVID-19 cases.\n\nThey are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals, and to date there are seven of them, either open or planned. The first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre. It has a capacity of some 4,000 beds. The other temporary field hospital sites are in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, and Washington.\n\nAdditionally, over the last month, some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use, along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK. By the beginning of April, one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients. Yet, by 12 April, the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients, and to date, only 41 patients have been treated.\n\nThis sudden blitz is both unusual and unprecedented. We regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population; in fact in recent years, some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance. Yet no new mega-hospitals, temporary or otherwise, were ever built to cope with them, nor were they seen to be needed. Why now?\n\nAccording to the King’s Fund, over the last thirty years, the number of ICU beds has declined, at a time when the population has risen. Over that period, around 34% of general and critical care beds in England have been lost.\n\nPeter Donaghy, an independent data analyst, reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population: in 2019, and across the four UK nations, he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [interpolation of his figures mine]. Cyprus has double that number, Germany has 29, the USA 34, and even Kazakhstan and Mongolia do better than the UK.\n\nBed shortages are not news, however. In 2008, it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997, when, ironically, the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK:\n\nIn 2016, the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages, so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89%, when 85% is considered the maximum safe level. This complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in, reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries, and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections.\n\nAnd in 2018, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) astonishingly reported that across the UK, 80% of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals, either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff, particularly nurses.\n\nTo cap things off, by 2019, it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations, and that when more emergency beds were needed, a policy of “escalation beds” came into force. The BMA drily reported that there was “little sign of this practice ending”.\n\nWhen one thinks of the NHS, intensive care is at the heart of most people’s perceptions of it. Yet the decline in the number of ICU beds over the last 30 years is so counterintuitive that it’s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import, but that intensive care beds are even more expendable. But whatever the case, in the event of a mass epidemic, the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020.\n\nWhat official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds?\n\nTo get a general feel, looking back to 2011, the government published the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper, outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be.\n\nThis paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Its precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic, which could occur suddenly at any time:\n\nmust be evidence based\n\nbe proportional to the level of threat\n\nbe flexible\n\nbe based on ethical principles.\n\nemergency powers must last no longer than 30 days\n\nSignificantly, it states that during any pandemic, it should be “business as usual” and notes that its recommendations are in line with an earlier, 2007, National Framework paper’s “defence in depth” approach to a pandemic.\n\nThe Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic, but must remain on their normal defence duties. So of course, this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals, transport patients, or manage the public.\n\nMilitary convoy off the coast at Devonport on the morning of 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown\n\nIn fact, the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies; it takes it as read that there would be enough UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients – for in 2009’s H1N1 swine flu outbreak, generally, hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients. There were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England, and 138 fatalities at the time, or 0.026% of those infected.\n\nExercise Cygnus\n\nFollowing the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper, however, the number of ICU beds continued to fall. Then, five years later, government held an unusual and secretive event called Exercise Cygnus.\n\nIt involved all government departments, all local authorities, and the NHS, right across the UK. Its report has not been published for “national security reasons” and so as not to “frighten the public”. However, according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation, Cygnus’ script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment.\n\nBased on its given hypotheses, it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required, large parts of the NHS would need to be switched off to redeploy staff, frail patients would be denied care, and mortuaries would be overwhelmed.\n\nWas this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other, like some kind of Grand Guignol? Did the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony, in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds, in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital, were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs?\n\nThe modelling of Cygnus was done by Imperial College, London, under the aegis of Neil Ferguson, who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19.\n\nTellingly, it is said that last month’s Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown, is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus. Ferguson’s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions – for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley’s article: Who controls the British Government response to Covid–19?\n\nOutside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages. So why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries?\n\nThe Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt. Simon Stevens was Chief of NHS England. Both had been involved in cutting bed numbers. Yet, since 2016, and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm, there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity.\n\nFollowing Exercise Cygnus, in 2017, the NHS Board published a short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR). Its approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament: the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), the NHS Act (2006), and the Health and Social Care Act (2012).\n\nDrawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board, Matthew Swindells (sic), it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year, and that the NHS was in a state of pandemic readiness. EPRR was rubber stamped, but as we have seen above, the somewhat rosy, self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017, and later, by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018, the BMA in 2019, and Peter Donaghy in 2020.\n\nBack to Exercise Cygnus. This was supposed to be merely a computer simulation. So why would it be an issue of “national security”? Why would it “frighten the public”? Perhaps because it was intended to change the real world into its simulated image?\n\nIt’s an uncanny coincidence that, after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared, it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment, that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas, that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of “Do Not Resuscitate” orders, and large, temporary, mortuaries have also been built up and down the country, just as in the simulation.\n\nTemporary mortuary set up in Ernesettle Fort, Plymouth\n\nSince the first reported UK Covid-19 case, there has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths, and its threat. All the while, there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty, that beds of other sorts are empty, and that although accident and emergency visits are down, people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number, are being told to “Stay at home – Save the NHS – Save Lives”. Many of these callers have then died for lack of care.\n\nIt has also emerged that standards in death registration have been lowered by the government, and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies, of any underlying condition, as a Covid-19 death. There need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it.\n\nDespite these efforts to inflate the death rate, actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS's depleted intensive care units. In that regard, Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus’ computer-generated scenario.\n\nThe government response, however, seems to match it exactly."

        "Canadian mRNA expert SUSPENDED for criticizing COVID vaccine for children\n\nA Canadian expert in messenger RNA (mRNA) was suspended for two months without pay for criticizing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine for children.\n\nDr. Patrick Provost, microbiology and immunology professor at the Université Laval (ULaval) in Quebec province, was punished for remarks he made in front of a panel of doctors and scientists back in December 2021. He said that the risks of injecting children with an experimental gene-altering mRNA COVID shot outweigh the potential benefits.\n\nHis remarks were not without basis as he studies mRNA in his own laboratory as part of his position at the university.\n\n“Being censored for doing what I’ve been trained to do – and hired to do – well, it’s hard to believe,” said Provost. “I had some concerns about something, [so] I searched the literature, I prepared a speech [and] delivered it to the public.\n\nThe professor only learned on June 14 that ULaval was suspending him for eight weeks without pay.\n\n“We need to be allowed to question again,” Provost remarked. “We should be able to discuss any ideas [and] any opinions. Because I express opinions against the narrative of the government, I was suspended.”\n\nProvost was not the only academic who was punished for standing up against COVID-19 vaccines for children. ULaval also suspended biology professor Nicolas Derome for bringing up his concerns about the shots back in November 2021.\n\nSimon Viviers, vice president of ULaval’s faculty union, said a grievance against the “attack on academic freedom” had been filed. He added that the penalties on Provost and Derome will make other professors think twice about making public comments on certain issues.\n\n“To allow [a university] to judge the validity of the comments made by a university professor in public and to sanction him in this manner is extremely problematic,” he commented. “It could really have a dissuasive effect [and] even lead to self-censorship.”\n\nMSM takes down Provost’s article shortly after publishing it\n\nApart from his suspension from ULaval, Provost’s article titled “The true portrait of COVID-19 in Quebec” was removed by the mainstream media outlet that first published it.\n\nThe piece published on June 22 in Le Journal de Quebec debunked the mainstream COVID-19 narrative. Provost wrote that the COVID-19 death rate is “greatly overestimated” due to a number of factors, including an infection rate “several times higher than reported” and the inclusion of “deaths with, and not because of, COVID-19” in the tallies.\n\nHe went on to say that a higher rate of “all-cause” death amongst the elderly only took place during the first wave from April to June 2020, as well as shortly after the imposition of the holiday lockdown or curfew and the deployment of the third vaccine dose in January 2022.\n\nWhile he did not associate the vaccines with higher death rates, he presented the data from around the world compiled by insurance companies showing an almost 40 percent spike of excess death-rate claims in largely vaccinated or boosted populations.\n\nProvost asked: “Did the pandemic … justify imposing such severe and comprehensive health measures, rather than targeted ones, to circumscribe a threat that targeted a well-known category of people?”\n\nQuebecor, the parent company of Le Journal de Quebec, took down the article – but independent media outlets such as Libre Media have republished it.\n\n“You are condemned by the media, by the government, and you are chased and put down,” lamented Provost.\n\nVisit MedicalCensorship.com for more stories about the silencing of doctors critical of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video of a British TV executive revealing the MSM’s shocking censorship on “The HighWire.”\n\nThis video is from the The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nStudy: mRNA vaccines more likely to put recipients at risk of serious injury than protect them from COVID-19.\n\nThe information battle of 2022 will be the war for what is left of America as big tech starts the year off with a devious new mass censorship campaign.\n\nScience papers now subject to extreme censorship if they question the “official” narrative on anything: COVID, AIDS, vaccines, climate, virology and more.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com 1\n\nNationalPost.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com 2\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Three doctors sue FDA, HHS for interfering with ivermectin prescription for COVID\n\nThree medical professionals sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for interfering with the prescription of ivermectin against Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.\n\nDr. Mary Talley Bowden, Dr. Robert Apter and Dr. Paul Marik filed a 37-page complaint in the U.S. District Court of Southern Texas on June 2. The FDA and HHS, alongside FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, were named as defendants in the complaint. The three doctors outlined five counts against the defendants.\n\nThe first count sought relief for “ultra vires” acts – actions taken beyond statutory authority – committed by the FDA. The plaintiffs accused the regulator of violating a U.S. Code that prohibits it from interfering “with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care practitioner-patient relationship.”\n\nThe second count alleged that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) by “arbitrarily and capriciously” taking inconsistent positions regarding the effectiveness of ivermectin against COVID-19. These stances purportedly “demonized the drug in the court of public opinion.”\n\nThe third count also outlined another APA violation by “not only limiting and essentially barring off-label use of ivermectin” as a COVID-19 treatment, but also “providing de-facto medical advice to patients”\n\nThe fourth count accused the FDA of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act through its interference with doctor-patient relationship and its ongoing, childish attacks against ivermectin.\n\nThe fifth count sought declaratory judgments and injunctive relief to stop all of the foregoing illegal actions by the two agencies named as defendants.\n\nThe government now has a deadline of 60 days – Aug. 4, 2022 – after the service of the summons to respond to the complaint.\n\nTwo plaintiffs part of FLCCC, which promotes ivermectin\n\nIncidentally, two of the plaintiffs in the June 2 complaint are connected to the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which advocates for the use of ivermectin as a safe and effective cure for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nBowden – an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor – serves as an advisor to the group, while Marik – a pulmonary and critical care specialist – serves as the group’s chairman.\n\nPrior to the June 2 complaint, Bowden had been involved in a lawsuit against Houston Methodist over COVID-19 vaccine mandates. It was the first medical facility that mandated COVID-19 shots for health workers as a condition of continued employment.\n\nThe hospital system had earlier dismissed several employees for refusing to comply with the edict, with some suing it for wrongful termination. A Texas federal judge unfortunately dismissed the case, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.\n\nThe ENT doctor first joined the staff of Houston Methodist sometime in late 2020 or early 2021. Her espousal of ivermectin, alongside opposition to vaccine mandates, eventually led to her November 2021 tweet announcing that she will no longer see vaccinated patients.\n\n“Going forward, I will not accept any patients who have been vaccinated. I will continue to see established patients [who] have had the vaccine, but all new patients have to be unvaccinated,” she tweeted.\n\nA week after posting her tweet, Bowden was suspended by the hospital system on Nov. 12 for “spreading dangerous misinformation” about the vaccines and the effectiveness of ivermectin. But the suspension was rendered moot as she handed in her resignation letter on that same day.

        "Science truth SHUTOUT: Twitter CENSORS doctor for sharing study showing impact of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine on male fertility\n\nTwitter has suspended a prominent doctor for sharing a study that showed Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine made men infertile.\n\nThe latest casualty in Twitter’s COVID-19 censorship is Dr. Andrew Bostom, an expert epidemiologist and an associate professor of medicine at the Brown University Center for Primary Care and Prevention.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, Bostom has been regarded as a significant dissenting figure for his opposition to COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates. He even qualified as an expert witness in epidemiology in a lawsuit filed by parents against Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee’s executive order requiring children to wear masks in schools.\n\nBostom’s testimony noted that constant mask-wearing affected the physical and psychological wellbeing of children, leading to social isolation and childhood depression. This testimony helped convince plaintiffs that McKee did not have the authority to force children to wear masks.\n\nOn June 19, Bostom shared an Israeli study published online ahead of publication in the peer-reviewed medical journal Andrology, which found that the COVID-19 vaccine impairs sperm count and motility. (Related: Pfizer, government regulators hid smoking gun data showing that COVID jabs cause birth defects and infertility.)\n\nTwitter immediately informed Bostom that the post violated the site’s policy against “spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,” and the Big Tech platform suspended his account.\n\nAs of press time, Bostom’s Twitter account is still suspended. It is unclear how long this deplatforming will last.\n\nBostom deplatformed for questioning effect of boosters on fertility\n\nIn an interview with the Epoch Times, Bostom said that Twitter suspending his account “fit into the whole pattern of silencing open discussion.”\n\nIn the offending post, Bostom merely quoted the Israeli study by saying that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine “temporarily impairs semen concentration and total motile count among semen donors, with apparent rebound [within] five months, but no data on boostering effect.”\n\nThe Israeli study authors claim the effects on male infertility resolve themselves within 150 days following vaccination, but the figures they presented in their paper actually suggested that was not the case. The authors also noted that they excluded men who have received booster vaccines.\n\n“Does boostering yield another decline?” said Bostom in his interview with The Epoch Times. “I kind of understood what they really showed, which is that some of the metrics, whether it was the counts or the motility, were still depressed. And I used their terminology … I didn’t do anything to exaggerate their findings.”\n\nBostom explained that he just wanted to point out that if the men were affected by the first series of vaccinations, studies should be conducted to figure out how booster vaccinations further destroy the fertility of men.\n\n“Maybe if they take these guys and have data on people that were semen donors and they had boosted them, when they followed them after the booster, you’d see another round of depression, and maybe it would be depressed – who knows – would it be depressed more? Would it be depressed less? Would the effect last longer? We just don’t have any data on that,” he said.\n\nBostom wants to know why questioning the effect of boosters on male fertility would be grounds for suspension on social media platforms like Twitter. “I don’t know why any of that was such a big deal.”\n\nSeveral people have come forward to Bostom’s defense. Phil Kerpen, president of the pro-free market Committee to Unleash Prosperity and the organization American Commitment, said Twitter was targeting him for “COVID wrongthink.”\n\nCardiologist and COVID-19 expert Dr. Peter McCullough similarly took to Twitter to defend Bostom. He shared pictures of the Israeli study’s results and highlighted how men still had exceptionally low sperm counts and concentration when measured 150 days or more after getting vaccinated.\n\n“Indiscriminate use of targeted, risk-stratified [emergency use authorization] rollout has led to a myriad of concerns. Never broadly apply a brand new experimental biologic agent on a large population without assessment of risk stratification,” wrote McCullough. “Over-used and now uninvited concerns in young men.”\n\nLearn more about Big Tech’s censorship on matters concerning COVID-19 vaccines at Censorship.news.\n\nWatch this episode of the “Health Ranger Report” as Health Ranger Mike Adams talks about how the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines make children permanently infertile.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nStudy: COVID “vaccines” are devastating men’s sperm counts.\n\nMSN quietly deleted a story revealing that severe COVID-19 is rarely found in the unvaccinated.\n\n“Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda” film exposes WHO for engaging in vaccine “population control experiment.”\n\nVACCINE WARNING: mRNA spike proteins linked to infertility in next generation via engineered “ovarian failure.”\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: Covid vaccines are killing babies in the first trimester at an astonishing rate… an “atrocity” to vaccinate expectant mothers.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nReclaimTheNet.org\n\nOnlineLibrary.Wiley.com\n\nTwitter.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Science magazine admits covid “vaccines” are useless and harmful\n\nBritish researchers say that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” do not provide any real protection against the latest “variant” of the disease, which the establishment is calling “Omicron” (Moronic).\n\nA new paper published in the magazine Science reveals that both antibody and T-cell protection are nowhere to be found post-injection. Meanwhile, the shots leave behind mystery substances inside a person’s body, often leading to chronic illness or early death.\n\nAnother thing the paper found is that the “fully vaccinated” are suffering so-called “breakthrough” infections with Moronic, as their T-cell response is now artificially tuned towards earlier variants of the disease such as Delta.\n\n“… when vaccinated but previously uninfected people suffer breakthrough Omicron infections, their T-cell response is biased toward earlier versions of Sars-Cov-2 – not to the Omicron variant that has actually infected them,” writes Alex Berenson on his Substack.\n\n“In other words, the mRNA shots appear to permanently wrongfoot the immune systems of people who receive and bias them toward producing T-cells to attack variants that no longer exist – even though they never were infected with those variants at all.”\n\nCovid jabs destroy natural, non-specific immunity\n\nNatural immunity that has not been damaged by pharmaceutical shots bears a component called non-specific immunity that targets invading pathogens non-specifically. In the case of covid, this means fighting against the virus generally rather than specifically in terms of variants.\n\nAfter a person gets injected, however, that non-specific immunity becomes altered, and suddenly the body is no longer able to fight off infections as they morph and mutate. (Related: Research out of Columbia University found that Moronic has a “striking” resistance to covid injections.)\n\n“While antibodies are the first line of defense against infection and try to clear the virus from the bloodstream, T-cells are the crucial second line,” Berenson adds. “They attack and destroy infected cells and also work with other parts of the immune system to produce more and better targeted antibodies later.”\n\n“Vaccine advocates have claimed endlessly that mRNA-generated T-cells help keep people from becoming severely ill with Covid even after frontline antibody protection against infection disappears … This study suggests that supposed protection may be a myth, and the low death rates from Omicron are simply a result of Omicron’s general lack of virulence in vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike.”\n\nThe British study further found that another big part of the body’s ability to fight off infections, antibodies, also become damaged by the shots. Post-injection, the immune system is left with the ability to produce only one type of coronavirus antibody, when the reality is that many different antibodies are needed.\n\nThose other antibodies would be produced naturally by the body without the shot. But once synthetic mRNA (messenger RNA) chemicals are dispensed, the immune system is left permanently damaged with no way to fight off illnesses that are constantly changing.\n\nThe study acknowledged this fact, however it was buried in highly technical language, suggesting that it was simply too politically incorrect to state plainly. The study also failed to compare the immune responses of the vaccinated to the unvaccinated, which is problematic, to say the least.\n\n“Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, the scientists did not look at the immune responses of anyone who was not vaccinated – with or without previous infection,” Berenson explains. “Thus the paper offers no direct comparison of the way Omicron may affect antibody and B- and T-cell responses in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.”\n\n“Why didn’t the researchers include unvaccinated people? Maybe because nearly all British adults are vaccinated and most boosted, so the authors wanted to concentrate on the risks Omicron poses to vaccinated people … Or maybe because they worried about what they’d find if they directly compared the two groups.”\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus and its health-destroying injections can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nAlexBerenson.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Doctors sue FDA for campaigning against use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19\n\nPhysicians filed a lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acting outside of its authority by directing the public not to use ivermectin.\n\nThe legal action filed on June 2 by Drs. Robert L. Apter, Mary Talley Bowden and Paul E. Marik indicated that the FDA launched a “crusade” against ivermectin as a treatment for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), “unlawfully interfered” with the doctors’ ability to practice medicine – even though the drug is fully approved by the agency for human use.\n\nThe suit filed in the District Court, Southern District of Texas, Galveston Division also included the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.\n\n“The FDA generally cannot ban particular uses of human drugs once they are otherwise approved and admitted to the market, even if such use differs from the labeling – commonly referred to as ‘off-label’ use,” the complaint stated.\n\nThe lawsuit also added that the FDA cannot advise whether a patient should take an approved drug for a particular purpose as decisions like these are within the scope of the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nThe doctors specifically mentioned the FDA publication “Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19” and tweets from the FDA official Twitter account – including one implying that ivermectin is intended only for animals.\n\n“This lawsuit, brought by three eminently qualified physicians, is a welcome development,” said Mary Holland, Children’s Health Defense president and general counsel.\n\nShe told the Defender that the doctors rightfully assert that the FDA, assisted by corporate media, has unlawfully interfered with the doctor-patient relationship and the appropriate treatment for individual patients. “Regulating the doctor-patient relationship is an area of the well-established state law – not federal law,” she added.\n\nPlaintiffs are respected practitioners with high success rates in treating COVID patients\n\nThe plaintiffs are well-respected in their field and hold records of high success rates in treating COVID-19 patients with ivermectin.\n\nApter is licensed to practice medicine in Arizona and Washington and has a COVID-19 patient survival rate of more than 99.98 percent. He was referred to the Washington Medical Commission and Arizona Medical Board for disciplinary action for prescribing ivermectin to treat COVID-19.\n\nIn a press release prepared by Boyden, Gray & Associates, the Washington, D.C.-based firm that represents the doctors, Apter said: “If doctors are freed to treat patients according to their best judgment and unprejudiced evaluation of the medical literature, many thousands more deaths and serious disabilities will be averted.”\n\nApter further said in the filed suit that government pressure, “largely through the FDA,” led pharmacies to refuse to fill ivermectin prescriptions for COVID-19.\n\nBowden, who has 40 years of experience in emergency medicine, started prescribing ivermectin to treat COVID-19 in 2020. She treated more than 3,900 patients with a success rate of over 99.97 percent.\n\nHowever, Houston Methodist Hospital, Bowden’s employer, forced her to resign for allegedly spreading “COVID misinformation” last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Marik was an author of more than 750 publications and professor of medicine and chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) in Norfolk, Virginia, from 2009 through 2021. He also served as a director of the intensive care unit at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.\n\nHe developed a protocol for treating COVID-19 called the “EVMS COVID-19 Management Protocol,” but was forced to resign from his positions at EVMS and Sentara Norfolk General Hospital for promoting the use of ivermectin.\n\nMarik said that refusing to allow patients to receive effective early treatment for COVID-19 led to innumerable hospitalizations and deaths and caused extreme distress for patients, their families and health professionals.\n\nThere were studies conducted showing that ivermectin can be attributed to lower COVID-19 death rates. However, the FDA continues to claim the drug is ineffective for treating COVID.

        "Doctors and scientific experts speaking up about COVID-19 and alternative treatments are being SILENCED\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) isn’t a natural disaster. A recent report by the Expose, called it as “one of the most manipulated infectious disease events in history.”\n\nIt is characterized by countless lies perpetuated by government bureaucracies, medical associations, medical boards, the media and international agencies.\n\nDespite proof that other treatments could save lives, there have also been many instances of intrusions into medical practice such as attacks on medical experts. Doctors who refused to follow orders and harm their patients have had their medical careers destroyed and non-qualified individuals with money, power and influence continue to have their say when it comes to healthcare.\n\nPoliticians, hospital administrators and federal bureaucrats are now recommending medical treatments based on special forms of care and prevention that are ineffective like the use of respirators and a series of harmful RNA vaccines instead of accurate and scientifically-based or experience-based information.\n\nProtocols enforced are not being formulated based on the experience of the physicians treating the largest number of patients successfully, but instead by individuals and bureaucracies that have never treated a single patient like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), state public health officers and hospital administrators.\n\nThe mainstream media, medical societies, state medical boards and Big Tech social media platforms claim that they are the only reliable source of information amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, entire websites have been removed and the careers of experienced clinical doctors and scientific experts in the field of infectious diseases have been demonized as they tried to share their knowledge on how to combat COVID-19 effectively.\n\nThe data from these health experts have also been called “misinformation” and “dangerous lies” even though they cite information from top experts in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, pulmonary critical care and epidemiology. (Related: Federal judge: Twitter must explain why it CENSORED journalist Alex Berenson, who exposed many unpopular truths about COVID.)\n\nThese blackouts of truth continue even when this information is supported by scientific citations from qualified medical specialists.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough, a respected expert in his field, has successfully treated more than 2,000 patients with coronavirus using a protocol of early treatment that other experts have ignored. Despite his success, he has been targeted, especially by those who benefit from COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nEarly this year, McCullough warned that the official pandemic narrative fiercely guarded by the establishment media and social media censors is “completely crumbling.”\n\nMcCullough has had his work published in peer-reviewed journals, where he reported an 80 percent reduction in hospitalizations and a 75 percent reduction in deaths, thanks to early treatment. Instead of trying to replicate his success, McCullough is attacked by information controllers who have yet to treat one patient.\n\nIn the entire history of medical care, early treatment of infections has been prioritized when it comes to saving lives and preventing severe complications. But these medical organizations and federal minions instead focus on attacking anyone who tries to initiate such treatment by threatening to void their license, removing hospital privileges, shaming and event threatening arrests.\n\nCOVID-19 research also being censored and retracted\n\nDoctors and scientists who are also active in research have also been ordered to retract their scientific papers from journals when their work deviates from the accepted COVID-19 norms – even when they are already printed.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a submitted paper or study is reviewed by experts in the field via a peer review. These reviews help weed out any errors before publication.\n\nThis means that unless there is fraud or another major hidden problem is discovered after the paper has been printed, the paper remains in the scientific literature.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many scientific papers written by experts in the field are being retracted from major medical and scientific journals even after publication. Upon checking, these papers were written by authors who tried to question the accepted dogma by the controllers of scientific publications, especially when concerning the “safety and efficacy of vaccines.”\n\nMany of these journals rely on advertising by pharmaceutical companies for their revenue. In most cases, these powerful pharmaceutical companies used their influence on the owners of these journals to remove articles that question the safety of their companies’ products.\n\nRead more related news at MedicalCensorship.com.\n\nWatch the video below for COVID-19 truths that you need to hear.\n\nThis video is from the mylivingbranch channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nMilitary doctor says she was ordered to cover up wave of covid “vaccine” injuries in servicemen.\n\nSouth African doctor: Severe COVID an allergic reaction to SPIKE PROTEIN nanoparticles.\n\nDoctor admits “we were all wrong” about COVID mandates.\n\nGerman doctor confirms: Covid “vaccines” are the cause of excess mortality.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nClarkCountyToday.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA denies generic drug fluvoxamine emergency use authorization as COVID treatment\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rejected a request to grant emergency use authorization to a cheap generic drug for the treatment of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This decision has sparked controversy and drawn criticism from many healthcare workers.\n\nThe drug in question is fluvoxamine, an FDA-approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is usually used as a treatment for mental health conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder.\n\nIn December 2021, Dr. David Boulware, a leading infectious diseases specialist and professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, submitted an emergency use authorization application for fluvoxamine to be used as an outpatient treatment for COVID-19 positive patients and to prevent the progression of their cases to hospitalization.\n\nThe FDA rejected the request just recently, claiming that the primary randomized controlled trial conducted in Brazil did not provide sufficient evidence to prove fluvoxamine’s benefits in preventing hospitalization and death. (Related: JAB ‘EM YOUNG: FDA approves Pfizer’s booster vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 without consulting vaccine advisory panel.)\n\n“The treatment benefit of fluvoxamine was not persuasive when focusing on clinically meaningful outcomes such as proportion of patients experiencing hospitalizations or hospitalizations and death,” wrote the FDA.\n\nThe Brazil trial involved nearly 1,500 participants. It met its primary endpoint, but the FDA had concerns about the fact that the “results were primarily driven by a reduction in the emergency department visits lasting greater than six hours, and there are uncertainties about the assessment of this endpoint and whether the six-hour timepoint represents a clinically meaningful threshold.”\n\nBig Pharma doesn’t stand to profit from fluvoxamine’s approval\n\nIn response to the FDA’s rejection, Boulware wrote a letter accusing the agency of using different criteria in analyzing fluvoxamine than when it analyzed drugs submitted for review by Big Pharma companies, including paxlovid and molnupiravir – anti-COVID-19 drugs by Big Pharma companies Pfizer and Merck, respectively. Both were granted emergency use authorizations by the FDA in December 2021.\n\n“FDA should evaluate clinical trials using the same endpoint definitions for generic drugs as for Big Pharma. The deliberate creation of two-tiered system is inappropriate,” wrote Boulware.\n\nBoulware further wrote that he believes fluvoxamine has a modest efficacy that is comparable to that of molnupiravir and paxlovid.\n\n“There remains a need for greater two-way communication between the FDA and the research community. FDA’s current guidance for trial endpoints for outpatient early treatment of COVID-19 pretends as if it is circa 2020,” wrote Boulware.\n\n“A medication is beneficial for many reasons, including shortening duration of illness or preventing progression to severe COVID-19. Progression to hospitalization/death is substantially lower in … those with prior infection. This is no longer a realistic trial primary endpoint.”\n\nWhen the Epoch Times asked the FDA for comment regarding Boulware’s letter, a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email that it “was unable to reasonably conclude that fluvoxamine may be effective for the treatment of outpatient adults with COVID-19 to prevent severe disease progression and/or hospitalization.”\n\nIn an interview with Stat News, Boulware admitted that he believes paxlovid is more effective than fluvoxamine. However, he believes fluvoxamine still has a place in COVID-19 treatment because high-risk patients are unable to take paxlovid because it could interact with other drugs they are taking to manage COVID-19’s effects.\n\nBoulware believes fluvoxamine, as a cheap and generic drug, could also be extremely useful for low- and middle-income countries where molnupiravir and paxlovid are not yet widely available.\n\n“It’s not my first choice as a physician but I should have the option,” said Boulware.\n\nBecause fluvoxamine was a cheap and generic drug and Big Pharma did not stand to profit from bringing it to the FDA for emergency use authorization, its cause was championed by Boulware and a group of other independent physicians and researchers who saw it as a cheap way to prevent COVID-19 infections from becoming severe cases.\n\nTheir efforts offered a test for how easily doctors and researchers who are not sponsored by Big Pharma could get a drug through the FDA in times of dire need.\n\nDespite the rejection, Boulware noted that more trials on fluvoxamine’s efficacy are ongoing. If more evidence comes in supporting the drug’s benefits, he and other researchers may resubmit their emergency use authorization application.\n\nMedicalCensorship.com has more on alternative treatments suppressed by the government.\n\nWatch this short video of Canadian-American Dr. Peter Attia as he talks about how CVS Pharmacy helped block fluvoxamine as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nThis video is from the Galactic Storm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nIT NEVER ENDS: FDA wants to make COVID vaccination an annual ritual like flu shots.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: Early treatment key to preventing COVID-19 deaths.\n\nDr. Bryan Ardis: Ivermectin didn’t fail people on COVID, the researchers and media did – Brighteon.TV.\n\nA simple amino acid treatment protocol helps COVID-19 patients recover faster.\n\nDr. Robert Malone: FDA, BARDA blocked the use of HCQ as a COVID treatment.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nEndpts.com\n\nStatNews.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "3 Doctors suppressed by the medical establishment for questioning COVID clot shots\n\nThree physicians have found themselves being chastised by the medical establishment for questioning the safety of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines. Their persecution aligns with a larger trend of doctors being smeared for opposing the narrative that the shots are “safe and effective.”\n\nThe doctors shared their story with the Epoch Times, outlining how medical boards penalized them for simply following the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nDr. Wade Hamilton\n\nPediatric cardiologist Dr. Wade Hamilton was targeted by the medical board for refusing to suggest the COVID-19 vaccine to a girl who had recovered from the disease. Given that she had already recovered, he argued that the girl had natural immunity.\n\n“That’s never been done previously in history – that you give somebody a vaccine or a shot that they already have natural immunity to. There is no information about the safety [of the COVID-19] vaccine. To give an mRNA vaccine, which is untested technology and in terms of preventing diseases with no real justification for a young person, I thought that the risk-benefit ratio favored not doing the shot,” explained Hamilton.\n\nHe later gave a medical exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine in one case, saying that “skipping informed consent in the case of the experimental COVID shots cannot be justified and demonstrates a lack of respect for the patient and for the long-established principles of medicine.” However, some psychiatrists filed a complaint against him for allegedly “denigrating the vaccine.”\n\nHamilton had stopped working at the hospital he was in since Jan. 1 as it required every staff member to get the COVID-19 vaccine. His license had also been attacked since questioning the shot, and he is now being forced to pay for a neuro-psychiatric test. (Related: Biden poised to ROUND UP anti-vaccine doctors and force them into insane asylums.)\n\nDr. Paul Gosselin\n\nMaine-based osteopathist Dr. Paul Gosselin had four complaints against him – all coming from health care professionals. They accused him of writing vaccine exemption letters for health care professionals, “disseminating misinformation” about COVID-19 and promoting drugs that were “inappropriate” for the disease.\n\nFor the crime of simply following the Hippocratic Oath, the state medical board suspended his medical license. “An emergency suspension means that my entire patient base would be left without a physician at a time when Maine had gutted the medical system of good physicians who did not want to get the dangerous [vaccine], and who were not willing to sell out patients to maintain their positions and licenses,” he explained.\n\nAccording to Gosselin, emergency suspensions are meant for physicians or other medical providers who “pose a direct, immediate threat to the public.” Doctors who molest or seriously hurt their patients and those with patients who die under their care fall under this category.\n\nHe also described how the mainstream media smeared him in news reports. “The statewide and national news initially reported that I was committing fraud, deceit, misinformation medical incompetence and the catchall disciplinary offense known as ‘unprofessional conduct.'”\n\nDr. James Thorp\n\nBoard-certified ob-gyn Dr. James Thorp has been in practice for more than 42 years. Thus, he did not hide his disappointment when medical institutions recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for women. According to Thorp, cases of fetal deaths and miscarriages saw an increase since the vaccines were rolled out.\n\n“It is unprecedented in the history of obstetrics that [the different institutions in charge] would violate the eternal commandment and golden rule of pregnancy: ‘Never ever use a new drug or vaccine in pregnancy without years of experience and extensive long-term safety experience and pregnancy outcomes data,'” he said.\n\nThorp also shared a letter from the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology that warned doctors against going out of line. Any physician sharing “misinformation” about the vaccine and the disease itself may be subjected to “disciplinary actions, including suspension or revocation of their medical license.”\n\nBack in December 2021, Thorp joined Ohio attorney and Brighteon.TV host Tom Renz on the latter’s “Lawfare with Tom Renz” program. He denounced the bullying of medical boards.\n\n“It’s unethical, immoral, illegal and unconstitutional. I will not stand and die, [and] they are not going to pull this off,” Thorp said at the time.\n\nHead over to MedicalCensorship.com for more stories about doctors being silenced for opposing the COVID-19 narrative.\n\nWatch Dr. James Thorp exposing how medical boards bully doctors that go against the COVID-19 narrative on “Lawfare with Tom Renz.”\n\nThis video is from the BrighteonTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nDr. James Thorp: Medical boards bullying doctors that go against the narrative – Brighteon.TV.\n\nDr. James Thorp tells Pastor David Scarlett: COVID vaccines are causing massive pregnancy loss – Brighteon.TV.\n\n‘What I’ve seen in the last 2 years is unprecedented’: Physician on COVID vaccine side effects in pregnant women.\n\nDr. Jim Thorp tells Dr. Bryan Ardis: Medical cartel gag order is illegal, unethical, immoral and illegitimate – Brighteon.TV.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Doctors SUE Twitter: “Silenced” after posting truthful information about covid\n\nThree physicians who say they were wrongfully banned from Twitter for posting “truthful statements regarding COVID-19 policy, diagnosis and / or treatment” are suing the social media giant in pursuit of justice.\n\nDrs. Robert Malone, Peter McCullough, and Bryan Tyson filed their complaint in the Superior Court of California. It alleges that Twitter breached its own terms and policies by silencing their voices and refusing to provide them with official “verified” badges.\n\nThe plaintiffs also say that Twitter’s actions caused them harm, and are asking the judge to order Twitter to reactivate their accounts so they can reconnect with their followers.\n\nAll three doctors are represented by Bryan M. Garrie and Matthew P. Tyson, the latter of whom sent a letter on May 12 to the directors and managing agents of Twitter requesting that these three accounts as well as two others be immediately reinstated with “verified” badges. The company failed to respond.\n\nTyson the attorney, who has no relation to Dr. Tyson, acknowledged that Twitter is a “private company,” and that it can “suspend user accounts for any or no reason.”\n\n“However, Twitter also implemented specific community standards to limit COVID-19 misinformation on the platform, and Twitter was bound to follow those terms,” he added.\n\nIf this lawsuit is a success, it will have far-reaching implications for Twitter\n\nTwitter’s content-moderation terms, the complaint adds, included removal procedures for ineffective treatments and false diagnostic criteria, as well as measures for “labeling” information as “misleading.”\n\nThe company failed to follow these procedures and instead gave the three doctors and numerous others the axe, rather than follow its so-called “five-strike policy.”\n\n“The consequences for violating our COVID-19 misleading information policy depend on the severity and type of the violation and the account’s history of previous violations,” Twitter’s website states.\n\n“In instances where accounts repeatedly violate this policy, we will use a strike system to determine if further enforcement actions should be applied.”\n\nStrike 1 involves “no account-level action,” followed by a 12-hour lock for Strike 2. Strike 3 results in another 12-hour account lock, followed by a seven-day account lock for Strike 4. Five more strikes and a user’s account gets permanently “suspended” – meaning banned.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that they relied on Twitter to fairly and in good faith enforce its terms, which they say the company did not do. Tweeting truthful information about covid, they say, does not violate Twitter’s terms of service, community standards, content moderation policies, or misinformation guidelines.\n\n“None of these physicians posted false or misleading information, nor did they receive five strikes before suspension,” Tyson the attorney added in his letter.\n\n“It’s no accident that Twitter violated its own COVID-19 misinformation guidelines and suspended the accounts of Drs. Zelenko, Malone, Fareed, Tyson and McCullough.”\n\nKeep in mind that all of the plaintiffs are licensed physicians. They are respectable people, unlike Twitter’s censorship trolls who willy-nilly throughout the plandemic shut down accounts of people and companies they do not like, applying its rules and policies unfairly and in a discriminatory way.\n\nIf successful, this lawsuit will set a precedent for social media free speech, and possibly lead to other lawsuits from other Twitter users who were unfairly targeted by the company.\n\n“These doctors are simply truth tellers,” wrote a commenter at The Epoch Times about the plaintiffs. “I want Twitter to expose any false or misinformation that these doctors supposedly posted. Show me!”\n\nAnother wrote that these doctors may also be able to sue for “harassment due to ideological motives,” as there is clearly a systemic bias at Twitter against truthful covid information.\n\nThe latest news about Twitter and other social media platforms can be found at Censorship.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Three doctors sue Twitter over censorship of COVID-related posts\n\nThree medical professionals sued Twitter for censoring their posts regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The suit also accused Twitter of refusing to grant the doctors “verified” badges even though they met the criteria.\n\nDrs. Robert Malone, Peter McCullough and Brian Tyson were named as plaintiffs in the suit filed June 27 at the Superior Court of California in San Francisco. The lawsuit argued that Twitter breached its own terms of service when it suspended the three plaintiffs for posting the truth. Thus, it asked the court to order Twitter to reinstate their accounts.\n\n“A truthful tweet regarding COVID-19 policy, diagnosis and/or treatment would not violate [Twitter’s] terms of service, community standards, content moderation policies or misinformation guidelines,” noted the lawsuit. It also argued that the Big Tech platform violated its own terms by permanently suspending accounts that did not have five strikes. (Related: Federal judge: Twitter must explain why it CENSORED journalist Alex Berenson, who exposed many unpopular truths about COVID.)\n\nUnder the five-strike policy, the first one does not result in punishment. The second and third strikes merit a 12-hour suspension, while the fourth results in a seven-day suspension. Users who incur five strikes are permanently banned from Twitter.\n\nThe plaintiffs pointed out that they were banned from the platform even though “none of [their] tweets qualified as a strike or otherwise violated [Twitter’s] stated rules.” They added that they seek to hold the social media giant liable “as the counter-party to a contract” and “as a promisor who has breached the terms it put in place.”\n\nFurthermore, the three doctors mentioned that Twitter refused to grant their accounts “verified” badges – shown as a blue check mark beside their names – on their respective profiles. “Notable and active” users such as “activists, organizers and other influential individuals” are qualified for these badges, which Twitter said were necessary “to encourage and maintain trust” on the platform.\n\nSuit follows earlier letter by the plaintiffs’ counsel\n\nThe June 27 lawsuit followed a May 12 letter by attorney Matthew Tyson, legal counsel for the three doctors. The letter addressed to Twitter’s legal department called on the Big Tech giant to reinstate the plaintiffs’ accounts, alongside those of Dr. George Fareed and the late Dr. Vladimir “Zev” Zelenko.\n\nTyson wrote that the five doctors were among “the most knowledgeable and helpful voices in the world regarding COVID-19 treatment” that was “disturbingly” blocked on Twitter. He added that the five “used Twitter as a valuable tool to share their firsthand experiences in treating COVID-19, relay important facts, express their personal viewpoints and opinions, and promote their products and services.”\n\n“They were widely followed on Twitter and likely saved thousands of lives by posting messages from their accounts before each of them was suspended,” noted the lawyer.\n\nTyson noted that while Twitter is a private company and that it was not bound by the First Amendment, it puts “specific community standards to limit COVID-19 misinformation on the platform” which it was bound to follow. “None of these physicians posted false or misleading information, nor did they receive five strikes before suspension,” he pointed out.\n\n“It’s no accident that Twitter violated its own COVID-19 misinformation guidelines and suspended the accounts of [the five doctors]. Twitter received express and implied threats from government officials to censor certain viewpoints and speakers, lest [it faces] the amendment or revocation of Section 230, or antitrust enforcement,” the lawyer continued.\n\n“Drs. Zelenko, Malone, Fareed, Tyson and McCullough are not bots, scammers or spammers. They are internationally recognized physicians with compelling messages that can save lives. Twitter should let them post, whether it or the current administration agrees with them or not.”\n\nWatch Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American interviewing Drs.

        "Doctor verifies VAERS data showing COVID-19 vaccines increase dangers to women’s reproductive health\n\nA board-certified obstetrics and gynecology physician verified the recent Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data showing the increased dangers posed by the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines to women’s reproductive health.\n\nDr. James Thorp diligently analyzed the numbers and found that the vaccines have increased by 1,000-fold cases of menstrual irregularities, such as abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nThorp told the Epoch Times last week that “COVID-19 vaccines are associated with increases in menstrual disorders, miscarriage, fetal chromosomal abnormalities, fetal cystic hygroma, fetal malformations, fetal cardiac arrest, fetal cardiac arrhythmias, fetal cardiac disorders, fetal vascular mal-perfusion abnormalities, abnormal fetal surveillance testing, abnormal fetal growth patterns, placental thrombosis and fetal death.”\n\nHis analysis found fetal chromosomal abnormalities to be 100-fold greater; fetal cardiac arrest 200-fold greater; fetal vascular mal-perfusion is a 100-fold greater; miscarriages, fetal malformation and fetal arrhythmia 50-fold greater; fetal cystic hygroma (major malformation) 90-fold greater; fetal placental thrombosis 70-fold greater; fetal cardiac disorders and growth abnormalities 40-fold greater; and fetal abnormal surveillance tests 20-fold greater.\n\nThorp conducted the analysis with a Department of Defense statistical consultant, who agreed to help but requested anonymity.\n\nAccording to Thorp, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG) should have demanded the safety data prior to pushing these dangerous vaccines – especially to pregnant women.\n\n“These institutions have violated the golden rule of pregnancy. New substances, be it nutraceuticals, drugs or vaccines, have never been allowed in pregnancy until long-term outcome data are available.”\n\nOther doctors stand by Thorp’s opinion that vaccines should be pulled out.\n\nJessica Rose Ph.D., who co-authored a VAERS analysis that got withdrawn by the academic journal Elsevier, said: “I do believe it is not only important but necessary to pull these products from pregnant/breastfeeding women and infants since there is no long-term safety data and the short-term data looks bad.”\n\nDr. Christiane Northrup, an ACOG fellow, also supports Thorp’s analysis.\n\n“Having been on the front lines of the DES disaster as a young OB/GYN, I am astounded that we are repeating the same kind of mistake but on a far more devastating level. COVID-19 shots must be stopped immediately in all pregnant women before further damage is done to the next generation,” Northrup stated.\n\nThese disconcerting pharmacovigilance signals from VAERS encouraged Thorp and other doctors to call for a ban on vaccines.\n\n“The COVID-19 vaccines make prior obstetrical disasters of diethylstilbestrol and thalidomide look like prenatal vitamins. I am calling for a worldwide ban and moratorium on the use of any experimental gene therapy and/or COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy until long-term safety data are irrefutable,” Thorp said.\n\nGag orders on healthcare professionals exposed in a paper\n\nThorp, who has practiced obstetrics for over 42 years, said many of the around 7,000 high-risk pregnant patients he had seen over the past year were vaccinated. (Related: ‘What I’ve seen in the last 2 years is unprecedented’: Physician on COVID vaccine side effects in pregnant women.)\n\nThe OB/GYN explained that although there has been an obvious increase in fetal deaths and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with the COVID-19 vaccination, attempts to quantify this effect are hampered by the imposition of gag orders on physicians and nurses that were imposed in September 2021.\n\nThe paper titled “Patient Betrayal: The Corruption of Healthcare, Informed Consent, and the Physician-Patient Relationship,” which the doctor co-wrote with his colleagues, including renowned cardiologist Peter A. McCullough, exposed the disciplinary threats made to healthcare professionals by their governing bodies in the United States.\n\nIn particular, healthcare professionals were prohibited from writing about complications related to the COVID-19 vaccines and data from VAERS, including those related to pregnant women and women of reproductive age.\n\n“Until further testing can be completed, including but not limited to studies of long-term outcomes, governing bodies of healthcare professionals, including ABOG, FSMB [Federation of State Medical Boards], ABMS [American Board of Medical Specialties], AMA [American Medical Association], AACN [American Association of Critical-Care Nurses], SMFM [Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine], ACOG and others should retract their injunctions aimed at eradication of vaccine hesitancy and focus instead on the promotion of truthful, honest communication which is integral to a patient’s informed consent,” the paper pointed out.\n\nIn just 12 months of the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines, the authors have reviewed 1,013 peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals. According to the paper, this has never occurred in the history of medicine for any drug, vaccine or medical device.\n\nThe authors encourage ABOG staff and examiners to review all these studies as the resources and references they cited in the said research all lead to the fact that the COVID-19 gene-therapy injections are dangerous in the population at large, particularly for women of reproductive ages, pregnant women and their offspring.\n\n“The dangers of the COVID-19 experimental gene-therapy are evident. ABOG must acknowledge the facts and retract its September 2021 threats. We and ABOG must make a strong public statement regarding the risks of this injection in women of reproductive age and in pregnancy, as a matter of ethical due diligence,” the researchers said.\n\nWatch this video that discusses the increase in miscarriages among vaccinated women.\n\nThis video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nALL covid vaccines destroy natural immunity, including in pregnant women and their babies.\n\nSTILLBIRTHS GALORE: The infant death wave has begun as pregnant women continue getting jabbed for “covid.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers suddenly concerned with tracking software, say it could be used to ‘hunt’ women seeking abortions.\n\nSources include:\n\nThe EpochTimes.com 1\n\nNCBI.NLM.NIH.gov\n\nThe EpochTimes.com 2\n\nTheGMS.co\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Dr. Peter McCullough: COVID-19 should be fought with early intervention, not vaccines\n\nDr. Peter McCullough is staying true to his message that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) can be defeated with early treatment – not vaccines – despite being relentlessly attacked by Big Pharma.\n\nMcCullough, an internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist and expert on early interventions against COVID-19, reiterated his stance during an interview with host Alex Newman in “Conversations That Matter.”\n\n“I proposed that COVID-19 illness should be treated in high-risk patients to prevent hospitalization and death,” said McCullough, claiming that this is why he has been relentlessly attacked by Big Pharma, who seek to only sell more COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“That proposal, in my view, should be uncontroversial,” he added. McCullough noted that Big Pharma’s insistence on pouring more resources to the experimental and deadly COVID-19 vaccines instead of properly funding early treatment options is killing a lot of people. (Related: Dr. Peter McCullough: Early treatment key to preventing COVID-19 deaths.)\n\nSeveral months ago, McCullough noted that more people in the United States have died due to the COVID-19 vaccines than those who have died in all wars the country has been involved in except the Civil War and World War II. Back then, the data suggested that as many as 187,000 Americans have lost their lives after vaccination. This far surpasses the approximately 120,000 Americans who lost their lives during World War I.\n\n“The treatment will evolve and change over time. We’ve had better and better drugs, better and better tools. [But] the shortcoming is patients not getting treatment who needs them. Patients who get hospitalized because they’ve not had access to or gotten high quality, early treatment,” said McCullough. “Being hospitalized has nothing to do with taking a vaccine. It has to do with whether or not someone was treated before the hospital.”\n\nMcCullough’s treatment program, known as the McCullough Protocol, involves at-risk individuals taking a mix of medicines like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin with vitamins and supplements like quercetin, zinc sulfate and vitamins C and D3.\n\n“Bio-pharmaceutical complex” doesn’t want to treat COVID-19 patients, only give them vaccines\n\nMcCullough’s main antagonist and the one thing preventing his and other early treatment protocols from becoming more widespread is what he calls the “bio-pharmaceutical complex.”\n\n“The bio-pharmaceutical complex is a private and public partnership consisting of … international foundations [like] the Rockefeller and the Gates Foundations … also the Wellcome Trust in England and the World Economic Forum in Switzerland,” noted author John Leake in the same interview with Newman.\n\nThese organizations have partnered with established Big Pharma companies and startups like Moderna and, through the generous application of funding, have crafted “a very elaborate international partnership expressly for pandemic response,” explained Leake.\n\n“The bio-pharmaceutical complex … has done a splendid job of driving the [pandemic] policy,” he continued. “Now, the most salient point about the bio-pharmaceutical complex is they’re relentlessly and almost exclusively focused on vaccine development and mass vaccine deployment as the policy response.”\n\nBecause of this single-mindedness, McCullough and Leake came to the clear conclusion that the bio-pharmaceutical complex is not actually interested in ending the COVID-19 pandemic, but in creating a worldwide monopoly on public health through vaccine development and mass vaccinations.\n\n“There’s an incredible amount of money floating around there, too,” agreed Newman.\n\nLearn more about Big Pharma greed at BigPharmaNews.com.\n\nWatch this episode of “Conversations That Matter” with Alex Newman as he interviews Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake about fighting both the COVID-19 pandemic and Big Pharma.\n\nThis video can be found on the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nFDA denies generic drug fluvoxamine emergency use authorization as COVID treatment.\n\nVACCINE GENOCIDE: Dr. Peter McCullough says COVID vaccines have now killed more Americans than World War I.\n\nBreggin, McCullough warn that vaccines are more dangerous than COVID-19 – Brighteon.TV.\n\nThe Big Logic: Lack of COVID-19 treatment protocol is reckless, says Dr. Peter McCullough.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nInfoWars.com\n\nCOVID19.OneDayMD.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Stanford, UCLA and others admit that risk benefit to covid “vaccines” is NEGATIVE\n\nA pre-print study authored by Peter Doshi from the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy reveals that the risk benefit to getting “vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is negative, meaning the shots are far more harmful than potentially beneficial.\n\nEntitled, “Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest Following mRNA Vaccination in Randomized Trials,” the paper bears the names of many other high-profile academics as well, including Sander Greenland from the University of California Los Angeles and Robert M. Kaplan from Stanford University.\n\nThe paper is currently undergoing peer review, and it will be a doozy to witness what happens next as its findings will technically be considered “misinformation” in the State of California if Assembly Bill 2098 gets passed, which Kirsch personally believes is unlikely.\n\nAB 2098, in case you missed our earlier coverage about this bill, would criminalize doctors who advise or prescribe patients with anything other than the government-approved “treatments” for disease, which in the case of the Fauci Flu means vaccines and only vaccines.\n\nIn a nutshell, the new pre-print article defies the narrative in that it exposes the injections as unsafe and ineffective. Any doctor who relies on its findings as part of his medical practice, however, could lose his medical license in the California if AB 2098 passes.\n\n“That’s how things work in California,” writes Steve Kirsch on his Substack.\n\n“It’s not about ‘follow the science’ anymore. That is not a defense. As a doctor you must ‘follow the herd.’ If you disagree with the masses, even if you are right, kiss your medical license good-bye!!”\n\nCovid jabs are genocide\n\nOne of the things that makes AB 2098 unpassable, in Kirsch’s opinion, is the fact that its wording makes it impossible for a physician to ever change his opinion on a matter, including vaccine safety.\n\n“Either 100% of the doctors are for it, or 100% will be against it,” Kirsch notes. “There can’t be a middle ground of you get your license revoked so everyone has to stick with the initial narrative.”\n\n“This means the vaccines will always be safe and effective in California even when they aren’t … If that doesn’t enforce conformity, I don’t know what will.”\n\nFortunately for people not in California, such restrictions are not the law of the land – at least not yet. In Tennessee, for instance, there is an effort to stop Chinese Virus injections from going into the arms of anyone under five, period.\n\n“Yesterday, I was joined by @tnhousegop Leadership in requesting that @GovBillLee direct the @TNDeptofHealth to halt any distribution, promotion or recommendation of the Covid vaccine for children under 5,” tweeted Rep. Jason Zachary.\n\nThe Publix supermarket chain, which is based out of Florida, is similarly refusing to inject children under five with the toxic brew – though children over five can still get jabbed at any Publix store if their parents wish.\n\n“I wonder if it has been considered the idea of starting a new medical accreditation board,” wrote someone at Kirsch’s Substack about a possible alternative to the current status quo in places like California.\n\n“Leading physicians such as Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Ryan Cole, Dr. Robert Malone and many other heroic doctors could form a new AMA accrediting board licensing physicians and providing a board that does not threaten to revoke licensure based on early treatment for covid or medical freedom [from] vaccines.”\n\n“If the licensing accrediting board for physicians is so corrupt, it may not be redeemable, and worth starting a new according board for physicians.”\n\nThe latest news about the Fauci Flu shot push can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nSteveKirsch.substack.com\n\nLegislature.ca.gov\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "ReFounding America: WHO cancelled doctors who were saving lives at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – Brighteon.TV\n\nWhen the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began in 2020, doctors such as Pierre Kory and Paul Marik treated patients with steroids, ivermectin and vitamin C. But these doctors, who effectively saved lives, were canceled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and government agencies despite patients dying by the thousands.\n\nKory testified in front of the U.S. Senate in May 2020 about adopting the use of steroids to contain the COVID-19 virus. Despite the positive outcomes of his treatments, he was shut down and disallowed to continue his treatment plan in favor of waiting for experimental vaccines using never-before-tested mRNA technology.\n\nIn the June 15 episode of “Refounding America” on Brighteon.TV, host Peter Breggin and guest Michael Capuzzo talked about COVID-19 treatments in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n“Ivermectin got more evidence for being helpful to people who are sick, and it is generally agreed upon that hydroxychloroquine is very, very good for the early stages of the disease,” Capuzzo said. In the first four or five days of the disease, when people get fever and cough, ivermectin produced positive results when administered in patients.\n\nOn the other hand, hydroxychloroquine is better for use as early treatment. That has become part of the ruse: so-called experts only tested it on already very sick patients, and not when the doctors recommend it. They purposefully poisoned sick patients and then told doctors to never use the drug.\n\nMainstream media outlets, which are connected to Big Pharma companies, picked up the story of doctors poisoning their patients with hydroxychloroquine. (Related: Dr. Robert Malone vows to resist vaccine mandate for children, talks about the Great Reset.)\n\nSuppression of effective drugs paves way for EUA of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nCapuzzo said those drugs were suppressed to pave the way for the Food and Drug Administration‘s (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“They can’t put the EUA into effect if they have one effective treatment that doctors can use. This means that they can’t move billions of dollars to drug companies to create vaccines for their globalist agenda as they move toward the ‘Great Reset,'” he explained.\n\nBig Pharma and their investors could lose a lot of money if FDA-approved drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are used to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe vaccines are not safe and only result in mass murder. Children, who are almost immune from the disease, are dying after getting their shots.\n\n“I think the reason for that is their ultimate aim is to make us submissive. [They want to know] if they can get mothers and fathers to sacrifice their children for drugs,” Capuzzo said.\n\n“If the parents listened or looked a little bit, they would learn the kids are not in danger of dying. You can have parties to get the disease and they would get a better immunity than they would ever get from the vaccines.” (Related: World Economic Forum wants to take advantage of coronavirus to enact “the Great Reset.“)\n\nAuthorities previously went through this kind of problem with the AIDS pandemic, where they kept saying that affected individuals should wait for the vaccine because there are no treatments. A lot of people died from bacterial pneumonia that went with immune deficiency diseases, and these people could have been saved.\n\nMainstream media and authorities like Anthony Fauci are trying to fool the world yet again.\n\nWatch the full June 15 episode of “ReFounding America” below.\n\n“ReFounding America” with Peter Breggin airs every Wednesday at 6-7 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nLeading virologist and mRNA pioneer Dr. Robert Malone predicts Great Awakening in response to Great Reset.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic was PLANNED as part of the Great Reset, warns Catholic priest Fr.

        "Biden administration sued over records covering COVID-19 treatment rationing\n\nThe Functional Government Initiative (FGI), an organization dedicated to raising public awareness about the officials, decisions and priorities of the government, sued President Joe Biden’s administration for not providing records of the distribution of a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) treatment on time.\n\nFGI is seeking records that will explain why the administration stopped shipments of monoclonal antibodies to Florida and other states.\n\nHowever, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and sub-agencies National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have not complied with legal requirements outlined in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), prompting FGI to file a case.\n\nCombat COVID, an official U.S. government site, encourages people who are at risk for serious COVID-19, have tested positive for the disease or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive to consider a monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment.\n\n“The mAb treatment can block the virus that causes COVID-19 from entering cells in your body and limit the amount of the virus within your body. This means you may have milder symptoms and may decrease the likelihood of you needing to stay in the hospital,” the website said.\n\nIn April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted this on its website: “The Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency use authorizations for certain antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick.”\n\nThe mAb treatment has been authorized by regulators against strains of SARS-CoV-2, and Florida is one of the first states to promote the treatment. (Related: Medical scientists cautiously describe 100% CURE for cancer using new monoclonal antibody treatment.)\n\nFGI has requested all records of communications referencing the development and implementation of the processes for determining the amount of mAbs to be distributed to each state or territory that had requested them.\n\n“The only way we’re going to be able to obtain these documents is through a lawsuit and that’s why we are suing HHS, NIH, and NIAID,” FGI Communications Director Peter McGinnis told the Epoch Times.\n\nMonoclonal antibody rationing decision could be politically motivated\n\nMcGinnis revealed that the rationing decision was “potentially motivated by politics,” noting that top administration officials and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have had arguments over the move in public.\n\nFGI emphasized that this makes it important to see emails and other records concerning the decision.\n\n“Hopefully, it’s not. I would hate to live in a world where we have a pandemic on our hands and the White House is restricting essential medical supplies over, ‘We don’t like this governor in the way that he attacks us, we’re not going to let him have this,'” McGinnis pointed out.\n\nAdditionally, the federal government handed out doses for free to the states, but the arrangement largely left states unable to order any doses themselves when the Biden administration started rationing in the fall of 2021, hitting states such as Florida and Texas.\n\nAt the same time, other states saw no change or an increase in allocation.\n\nFGI filed the requests for information back in February and the HHS acknowledged them, but no update has been provided since. The law states that within 20 days the agency should notify the requester whether they will comply or not. The NIH sent an automatic acknowledgment and had an employee reach out for clarification, but only after the 20-day limit. After FGI responded to the questions, the NIH stopped replying.\n\nFurthermore, NIAID told FGI on May 10 that the requests were being reviewed and expressed that the estimated time was six months. There was no clear feedback on whether a search was underway or whether a review merely referred to deciding whether or not to process the requests.\n\nFGI asked the court to order the plaintiffs to provide the records within 10 days.\n\nVisit Pandemic.news for more news related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWatch this video that talks about why Joe Biden banned monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThis video is from the JosephJenkins channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nDEATH MARCH: FDA orders doctors in eight states to stop treating covid patients with monoclonal antibodies.\n\nBiden cuts off America’s supply of monoclonal antibodies – only “vaccines” allowed.\n\nAmerican Journal host Harrison Smith slams “racist” monoclonal antibodies treatment for COVID-19.\n\nAnother 14 states have been cut off from monoclonal antibody treatments, compliments of the Biden regime.\n\nNow New York is refusing monoclonal antibodies for white people.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nCombatCovid.HHS.gov\n\nCDC.gov\n\nDocumentCloud.org\n\nNewsweek.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast Updated on July 20, 2022\n\nNBA all-star and reigning champion Andrew Wiggins says that despite all of his recent accomplishments, he regrets taking the COVID-19 jab. Wiggins, a forward with the Golden State Warriors, was required to accept the jab under a San Francisco vaccine mandate or be forced to sit out all of his team’s home games, having been denied a religious exemption by the NBA.\n\nDuring a recent interview with the sports media site FanSided, Wiggins was asked about taking the COVID vaccine ahead of the 2021-2022 NBA season, which ended in his Golden State Warriors winning the league championship. To the apparent surprise of the FanSided interviewer, Wiggins said that he regrets taking the shot, despite his all-star season and championship run, and that he feels like he didn’t really have a choice in the matter.\n\n“I still wish I didn’t get it, to be honest with you,” Wiggins said. “But you gotta do what you gotta do, you know?”\n\n“I did it and I was an all-star this year, and a champion. So that was the good part, just not missing out on the year. Best year of my career,” Wiggins went on, before expressing concerns about what he was forced to put in his body, saying that it “wasn’t my choice.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“But for my body, I just don’t like putting all that stuff in my body. So I didn’t like that and I didn’t like that it wasn’t my choice. I didn’t like that,” Wiggins said, remarking that he had been given an ultimatum of “get this or don’t play.”\n\nAhead of the 2021-2022 NBA season, Wiggins’ vaccine status was the topic of much media scrutiny, alongside others like Brooklyn Nets player Kyrie Irving, who has yet to accept the vaccine and successfully waited out New York City’s mandate. As a member of the Golden State Warriors, Wiggins is subject to San Francisco’s vaccine mandate, which bars the unvaccinated over the age of 14 from partaking in indoor events, including NBA basketball games and practices. He applied for a religious exemption from the NBA, which would have allowed him to skirt the San Fransico vaccine mandate, but was denied.\n\nWhile the NBA itself has no vaccine mandate, as the players’ union has staunchly opposed them implementing one, several cities that house teams do, and the NBA has co-operated fully with them, seemingly at the expense of their own players.\n\nOther professional sports leagues have faced similar issues, notably Major League Baseball, where multiple teams’ cross-border trips to play the Toronto Blue Jays have become a frequent news topic as several MLB players have been barred from entering the country due to their COVID vaccine status.\n\nIn the world of tennis, Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic was even detained over his vaccine status during a trip to Australia and has been barred from entering the United States to compete in the US Open under Biden’s COVID rules, due to being unvaccinated."

        "As bad as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 sickness it causes are, warning cries are increasing over a much bigger threat with the potential to kill 90% of the U.S. population. And, unlike the virus, Washington has known of the threat for decades and done little to nothing.\n\n“We have seen this movie before and are living through it now,” said Peter Pry, one of the nation’s leading experts on electromagnetic pulse, the electric grid killer that threatens naturally from the sun and from weapons held by China.\n\n“If we are not even prepared for the coronavirus, imagine the consequences if we get hit with a real existential threat, like EMP,” he said.\n\nAdvocates for protecting the nation’s electric grid and other vital systems, including military bases, from an EMP attack are seizing on the virus crisis to inject urgency into budgeting to protect electric transformers, transfer stations, and wires from disruption or meltdown.\n\n“For the $2 trillion that will be spent on the coronavirus, we could harden all critical infrastructures against EMP, deploy space-based missile defense Brilliant Pebbles before the end of a second Trump term, modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent from top to bottom (delivery vehicles, weapons, scientific-industrial base), and have over $1 trillion to spare,” said Pry, a key member of congressional EMP commissions and author of the new book The Power and the Light: The Congressional EMP Commission’s War to Save America 2001 – 2020.\n\nBrian Sullivan, a government and military security analyst, said, “Can you imagine if our grid went down and we lost electricity for an extended period of time? As bad as our current situation is, it could always be a lot worse. We relied on our government leaders to prepare our country for a pandemic, and we see what that got us. We rely on that same leadership now to protect our electric grid.”\n\nWhile warnings of the current pandemic have been around for less than a year, reports have been written about EMP attacks for decades. The first congressional EMP panel, for example, warned of a yearlong blackout following an attack on the electric grid.\n\n“The EMP Commission estimates a nationwide blackout of the United States lasting one year could kill 90% of Americans from starvation and societal collapse,” said Pry. That would be about 295 million people.\n\nIn the past, warnings have been met inside the government and energy industry with eye-rolling. But President Trump has taken the threat seriously, especially as China and other foes have developed EMP weapons, and signed an executive order to move toward protecting the grid. The military has also taken steps to protect its operations.\n\nBut Pry details in his new book the efforts inside the “deep state” federal bureaucracy and electric industry to “slow-roll and sabotage” Trump’s agenda while making it look like they’re making progress.\n\n“The strategy of pretending to do something but really doing nothing and then throwing money at the threat when it happens will get millions of Americans killed when there is an EMP,” he told Secrets."

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe roll out of the Monkeypox “Plandemic” has been carefully planned and coordinated, much like the COVID Plandemic of 2020, including having simulations on how this “plandemic” will evolve, much like the 2019 Event 201 which simulated, with almost precision accuracy, how the COVID plandemic would evolve. See:\n\nThis past weekend the World Health Organization officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Kit Knightly of Off-Guardian.org reported:\n\nThe World Health Organization has officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Following their second emergency meeting on monkeypox in less than a month, WHO Director-General Thedros Adhanom told the press: In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations […] For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” For anyone living under a rock for the past two years, a PHEIC is defined as: an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response” It is the highest alert WHO can issue, and grants them legal authority to issue travel warnings or restrictions, inspect and critique the public health measures of member states and other things of that nature. Exactly what that means in this instance, and what form the “coordinated international response” will take, it is currently too early to tell. (Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop “plandemics”:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.”\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.” Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. “I would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven’t been used in this context and in this scale before,” Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public."

        "As the cost of essential goods rises faster than it has in decades, billionaires in the food and energy sectors are increasing their fortunes by $1 billion dollars every two days\n\nby OXFAM, Canada\n\nFor every new billionaire created during the pandemic — one every 30 hours — nearly a million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 at nearly the same rate, reveals a new Oxfam brief today.\n\n“Profiting from Pain” is published as the World Economic Forum in Davos takes place for the first time face-to-face since COVID-19, a period during which billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost to their fortunes.\n\nIn Canada, the wealth of billionaires has increased by 57.1 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic, in March 2020. The 41 richest billionaires own as much as the poorest 40 per cent of Canadians.\n\n“Billionaires gathered in Davos have enjoyed an obscene surge in their fortunes over the last two years. The pandemic and now the steep rise in food and energy prices have been a bonanza for the wealthiest, while millions of people face hunger and poverty as the cost living shoots up,” said Ian Thomson, manager of policy for Oxfam Canada.\n\nThe brief shows that 573 people became new billionaires during the pandemic, at the rate of one every 30 hours. We expect this year that 263 million more people will crash into extreme poverty, at a rate of a million people every 33 hours.\n\nBillionaires’ wealth has risen more in the first 24 months of COVID-19 than in 23 years combined. The total wealth of the world’s billionaires is now equivalent to 13.9 per cent of global GDP. This is a three-fold increase (up from 4.4 per cent) in 2000.\n\n“Billionaire wealth is growing because the super-rich have rigged the system for decades and are now reaping the benefits. The wealthiest — most of whom are men — are benefiting from privatization, pharmaceutical monopolies, fossil fuel subsidies and rollbacks of workers’ rights. Meanwhile, low-income people are working harder and earning less in pay,” said Thomson. “Inequality risks tearing apart our societies if we don’t stop it.”\n\nOxfam’s new research also reveals that corporations in the energy, food and pharmaceutical sectors — where monopolies are especially common — are posting record-high profits, even as wages have barely budged and workers struggle with decades-high prices amid COVID-19. The fortunes of food and energy billionaires have risen by $453 billion in the last two years, equivalent to $1 billion every two days. Five of the world’s largest energy companies (BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and Chevron) are together making $2,600 profit every second, and there are now 62 new food billionaires.\n\nFrom Sri Lanka to Sudan, record-high global food prices are sparking social and political upheaval. Sixty per cent of low-income countries are on the brink of debt distress. While inflation is rising everywhere, price hikes are particularly devastating for low-wage workers whose health and livelihoods were already most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly women, racialized and marginalized people. People in poorer countries spend more than twice as much of their income on food than those in rich countries.\n\nToday, 2,668 billionaires — 573 more than in 2020 — own $12.7 trillion, an increase of $3.78 trillion.\n\nThe world’s 10 richest men own more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of humanity, 3.1 billion people.\n\nThe richest 20 billionaires are worth more than the entire GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA worker in the bottom 50 per cent would have to work for 112 years to earn what a person in the top one per cent gets in a single year.\n\nThe pandemic has created 40 new pharma billionaires. Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer are making $1,000 profit every second just from their monopoly control of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite its development having been supported by billions of dollars in public investments. They are charging governments up to 24 times more than the potential cost of generic production. Eighty-seven per cent of people in low-income countries have still not been fully vaccinated.\n\n“The extremely rich and powerful are profiting from pain and suffering. This is unconscionable. Some have grown rich by denying billions of people access to vaccines, others by exploiting rising food and energy prices. They are paying out massive bonuses and dividends while paying as little tax as possible. This rising wealth and rising poverty are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to do,” said Thomson. “The Canadian government talks a good game about taxing extreme wealth inequality but we need to see more action. In the last two federal budgets, new taxes on luxury goods and increased tax rates on big banks have been announced but not implemented. The true test will be if Canada and other major economies find the political will to finally tax billionaire wealth.”\n\nRead the full report at OXFAM, Canada.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public."

Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public."

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 46,618 deaths and 4,682,268 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines (details below).\n\nIn the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS) is now reporting 29,635 deaths and 1,350,950 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there has been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020. (833,968 cases, 9,279 deaths – source.)\n\n46,618 Deaths and 4,682,268 Injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,618 fatalities, and 4,682,268 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,126,925) are serious injuries.\n\n“Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here.

women. (Source.)\n\nThis has to be the saddest, most criminal activity of Big Pharma and the FDA by allowing these COVID-19 shots to be injected into pregnant and young women.\n\nPfizer had data showing how dangerous these shots were for pregnant women, but the FDA gave authorization anyway.\n\nDr. Byram W. Bridle addressed this human tragedy on his blog earlier this week:\n\nI Am In Shock. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) had requested 75 years to release the documents that they reviewed from Pfizer prior to issuing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b mRNA ‘vaccine’ (Comirnaty) against SARS-CoV-2, which can cause COVID-19. However, a judge over-ruled this and issued a court order that the documents be released in large monthly installments. Today, an absolutely shocking set of data were brought to my attention. They are not new. They are from a document that was in the data dump released back in May of this year. However, I want to help my fellow scientists in making sure that this science gets widely distributed throughout the world. This is for the sake of ‘fully informed consent’, something that regulatory agencies, public health officials and too many physicians seem to have abandoned over the past couple of years. For a long time I have been arguing that our children need to be left out of the massive conflicts over the science underpinning COVID-19. In my opinion, adults can conduct their own risk-benefit analyses regarding whether they want to receive one of the current COVID-19 inoculations. However, far too many adults are making these decisions based on pseudo-science, data from flawed studies, misinformation, and outright disinformation being propagated by physicians and public health officials, many of whom are unqualified to opine on anything in the field of vaccinology. I have never felt comfortable about these injections being used in ‘children, adolescents and young-adults of child-bearing age’. This was the precise terminology I used in a parent’s guide to COVID-19 vaccines that I wrote more than one year ago. The highest quality data for assessing a novel medical product are derived from clinical studies. This is because these types of experiments in people are typically well-controlled and include what is known as ‘active monitoring’; there is follow-up to assess safety and efficacy. This is why the clinical testing phases should never be compromised. With this in mind, let’s explore a stunning set of data that Pfizer provided to the US-FDA. The data in this document were accumulated up until February 28, 2021. Notably, on page 9, safety concerns based on the US Pharmacovigilance Plan included “missing information” on “Use in Pregnancy and lactation”. The data that had accumulated up to the end of February, 2021 were from too small of a sample size (i.e., # of pregnant or lactating women) to justify its use in these populations. However, here are the data that were available at that time regarding outcomes in pregnant women that had received Pfizer’s COVID-19 inoculation; this is quoted from the top of table 6 (I have italicized and/or bolded the most important points)… Pregnancy cases: 274 cases including: • 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3 mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins). • Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted). Apparently, outcomes will never be known for 88% (238/270) of the pregnancies. Why was the follow-up rate on these cases so abysmal? NutriTruth has a great graph on their website that summarizes the results from cases for which follow-up data were available… It appears that data would be available for five of the pregnancies, but these outcomes were still unknown at the time that Pfizer’s document was written. As such, there are solid data available from 29 pregnancies. One out of 29 of these pregnancies resulted in a ‘normal’ outcome. This means that 28 out of the 29 babies died! That is a 97% death rate. I don’t care which trustworthy data set you look at to determine a ‘background’ death rate, none of them come close to 97%. Spontaneous abortions are more common than many people appreciate, but, again, they are nowhere near the rate in this study. Even in the case of the ‘normal outcome’, this means there was an apparently healthy baby. However, one cannot be certain that the outcome was ‘normal’, until the baby has had all of their physiological systems fully mature, which means early adulthood. I have looked at Pfizer’s pre-clinical reproductive toxicity data and they are fatally flawed. Issues included ‘vaccinating’ the females only; apparently it was forgotten that ‘it takes two to tango’. Also, the rodent models that were used express the low-affinity version of the receptor for the spike protein encoded by the ‘vaccines’. People express the high-affinity receptor. This means the rodent models aren’t capable of revealing toxicities that might be associated with the spike protein. In short, the pre-clinical studies could provide no assurance whatsoever that Pfizer’s vaccine would be safe in the context of pregnancy. Now there is proof that data were in the hands of regulatory agencies that suggested the potential for a 97% fatality rate for babies from ‘vaccinated’ women. I have collaborated with scientists and physicians about the post-rollout ‘real-world’ studies on pregnancy and the COVID-19 shots. They are highly flawed. I co-authored a paper about this, but have yet to find an editor that will even allow it to undergo peer review (I have had no problems with this for any of my cancer- or basic virology-focused papers). Regardless, many other reputable scientists and physicians have been addressing this. Further, these ‘real-world’ studies should never have been authorized based on the data presented here. Many countries have pushed Pfizer’s COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ on pregnant women, often via mandates. This was been done with the full blessing of their societies for obstetrics and gynecology. Are obstetricians and gynecologists going to continue to make these recommendations with these data in-hand? At the end of the day, couples experiencing pregnancies or who wish to do so must make it their own responsibility to educate themselves to facilitate fully informed consent. Too many obstetricians and gynecologists are either too superficially trained in the immunological sub-discipline of vaccinology or are too afraid of contradicting a narrative for which dissent is punished. Some physicians are starting to speak up about this. Unfortunately, their singular personal observations are simply deemed anecdotal. However, as a scientist, I have been trained to observe the cumulative nature of these reports; to not dismiss them out-of-hand, and to use them to formulate legitimate scientific questions. If you or your baby have experienced any issues post-inoculation, please report these to your physician. They are obligated to submit an adverse event report, without opining on whether or not they think it might or might not be related. The accumulation of these reports is the only way scientists can help identify safety signals during a public rollout of a novel medical product. A 97% death rate among babies from pregnant mothers that were ‘vaccinated’ is appalling. And this was from Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. This suggests a massive breakdown in the health regulatory process. The public, whom health regulatory agencies are to be serving, should demand accountability from these government-run institutions. If I were a regulatory scientist assessing the pregnancy outcome data from Pfizer, there is no way that I would ever have supported the use of their inoculation in pregnant women. And I would never have allowed ‘real-world’ data from flawed studies to replace proper pre-clinical and clinical trials. Nor would I remain silent about this knowledge. Regulators who know better need to start speaking up.\n\nRead the full article at COVID Chronicles.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper was recently interviewed where she stated:\n\n“For a first-trimester woman to get this injection, they have more of a chance of having a miscarriage or stillbirth than if they were to actually take an abortifacient.”\n\n2 Young Mothers Talk About Losing Their Unborn Babies Just After a COVID-19 Vaccine:\n\nReports of Brain Damage, Seizures, Bowel Disease Continue for Babies 6 Months Old to 4 Years Old\n\nAnother 103 records of COVID-19 vaccine injuries were added to VAERS yesterday (July 22, 2022) for the 6-month to 4-years-old age group, continuing to show horrible side effects that include brain injuries, anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, eye infections, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes, since these shots were approved for this age group a few weeks ago, in June.\n\nI put the latest 103 records on the second page here. I read through every one of them, and I have to admit that emotionally, it is not an easy thing to do.\n\nSome “highlights” from the write-ups of these infants who were injected.\n\nA 6-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2370120:\n\nwithin 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing; within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend and describes the occurrence of RESPIRATORY ARREST – On 30-Jun-2022, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening) and LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant).\n\nA 4-year-old boy from VAERS ID 2369485:\n\nThursday, July 7th, I picked him up from school and walked him home. He only ate part of his fig bar because he said it didn”t taste good. He also didn”t want any dinner which is very rare. He said that his tummy hurt. I assumed it was the fig bar. He finally ate 2 bites of soup but didn”t want any more. When I brushed his teeth I only brushed half because he said it hurt. He went to bed pretty easily but he looked so exhausted. About 10:00pm he woke up and he was sweaty and clammy. He wasn”t feeling well and seemed a bit delirious because he didn”t realize I was really in the room with him as I rocked him. He cried about his tummy hurting and pointed to below his belly button. He cried and said he wanted to go home. He didn”t realize he was home.\n\nA 3-year-old girl from VAERS ID 2366237:\n\nThe night of the vaccine, she developed a fever and woke up. She has had a fever ever since the vaccine. She is lethargic and will not eat. I took her to the urgent care on 7/8/2022. She had a strep and COVID-19 test that were negative. Her highest fever was 104. I also took her to the ER yesterday. She is currently still sick.\n\nA one and a half year old boy from VAERS ID 2365977:\n\nAfter receiving vaccination, patient was out of it for approximately ~15 mins, after that period seemed lethargic but otherwise normal. Patient showed no other adverse reaction until time for his nap at 12:40p, when he felt warm to the touch but underarm temperature reading was 98.7. He woke up atypically early at 2:50p, but laid in crib seemingly playing quietly. At 3:56p, mother heard whimpering sound and went to check on patient who was convulsing and unconscious until EMS arrived at 4:03p, he was very hot but EMS was unable to get an accurate temperature reading. Convulsions stopped when paramedics arrived at approx. 4:03p and patient was unresponsive for an additional approx. 10 mins. Patient was placed under ice by EMS and had a temperature reading of 102.4 when he arrived Hospital in approx 20-30 mins later.\n\nA six-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2362981:\n\n24 hours post-vaccine baby had a BRUE (brief resolved unexplained event). While changing his diaper he went unresponsive and I questioned if he was breathing. I startled him back with shouting his name. He then became unresponsive again. This occurred 4-5 times over 1-2 minutes. I attempted startling and tryingg go to get a reaction and he became alert again. I took him to the ER where he was diagnosed as having a BRUE and was kept on monitors overnight.\n\nI shudder to think what awaits those in the future who allow these little ones to suffer so much. “Vengeance is mine” says the Lord, and there will be justice.\n\nRescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? (Proverbs 24:11-12)\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public."

        "(NaturalHealth365) Not too long ago, when the media first began talking about new COVID shots from Big Pharma companies Pfizer and Moderna, experts and everyday people – all of whom were swiftly labeled “conspiracy theorists” – warned that these hastily made mRNA jabs would almost certainly give way to vax mandates and an endlessly increasing, vice grip-like control over individuals’ bodily autonomy. One dose or even two doses would never be enough – Pharma and government officials would demand that people take three or more doses to function in society and put food on their families’ tables.\n\nNow, a recent move from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seems to perfectly exemplify this concerning prediction. The decision is sure to boost Pfizer’s and Moderna’s profits, paid for with taxpayer money. But will these shots actually “boost” Americans’ health?\n\nDid the U.S. government just set a precedent for unending COVID shot boosters?\n\nOn June 29, 2022, President Biden’s Administration announced a $3.2 billion deal to “secure 105 million doses of Pfizer’s latest COVID-19 vaccine for [a] fall vaccination campaign.” The deal came with an option to buy up to 300 million doses.\n\nThe very next day after this deal was made, the FDA came out and said that these fall booster shots would need to be modified to target specific variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nSo, in addition to using taxpayer money to purchase billions of dollars worth of shots from these companies, the government is now telling these companies to make new versions of the shots – effectively reinforcing that whatever COVID shots people already got earlier in the pandemic are useless and likely won’t “count” toward future vax mandates.\n\nIs this what we can expect to see every fall from now on, just like flu shots?\n\nDr. David Gortler is a pharmacologist and FDA reform advocate at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. In an email to Children’s Health Defense, he writes, “Nobody is taking the booster shots, and the White House just keeps ordering them and ordering them from Pfizer,” adding that “Pfizer is on track to make $50 billion off vaccines in 2022 alone and the government keeps on ordering.”\n\nNotably, no human clinical trials to date have tested modified COVID shots with Omicron subvariants, according to Children’s Health Defense (although Pfizer and Moderna will reportedly begin such trials shortly).\n\nIn a Twitter post, Children’s Health Defense founder Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. stated that the White House “has dropped all pretenses that this is about protecting public health,” calling the move an “unsheathed corporate welfare project to further enrich the shareholders of the most profitable industry in history.”\n\nPay attention: You can never be “fully vaxxed” against COVID-19\n\nYou’ll remember at the beginning of the vax rollout how people would brag about being “fully vaxxed” and how government officials would say that “fully vaxxed” individuals were doing their part to protect themselves and each other … notice how quickly this argument fell apart, for a few reasons.\n\nFor one thing, we now know that these COVID shots do NOT stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and that vaxxed individuals infected with the virus are as infectious as vax-free individuals who are infected (and building natural immunity). The idea that getting jabbed will prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is simply not grounded in reality.\n\nFor another thing, and according to the U.S. government, there is no such thing as “fully vaxxed” anymore.\n\nOn its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not refer to people as fully vaxxed but instead says that people should “stay up to date with the recommended vaccines.” They use the term “up to date” to describe anyone who has received “all doses [of the COVID shots] in the primary series and all boosters recommended for you, when eligible.”\n\nThis might seem like a subtle change in terminology, but the implication is significant: anyone who agrees to get a vax is effectively agreeing to get as many doses of it as deemed necessary by the government.\n\nThis also means that as soon as someone decides to decline any further shot, they too must suffer the consequences that the government has gotten away with, such as banning you from travel, access to public spaces, and even employment.\n\nHaving to perpetually consume drugs to participate in society is not ethical, yet many will argue that this is precisely the groundwork laid for the American public.

        "(NaturalHealth365) On July 8, 2022, Big Pharma company Pfizer proudly announced that their highly profitable gene-based COVID shot received the stamp of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 12- to 15-year-old kids and teens.\n\nChildren’s Health Defense president and general counsel Mary Holland says this news is “head-spinning.” Let’s see why.\n\nTwo big problems with Pfizer’s money-making COVID shot that received full FDA approval for kids 12 to 15 years old\n\nThere is no hiding at least two facts when it comes to these mRNA COVID shots:\n\nFirst, these shots are making some people very sick – from heart inflammation to paralysis to blood clots and an untold number of other health issues.\n\nThese shots are making some people very wealthy. According to various sources, Pfizer earned a whopping $37 billion in sales from its mRNA COVID shot in 2021. Like Moderna, it is making about $65,000 per minute – that’s over $1,000 per second – with no small thanks to its heavily propagandized drug.\n\nThe company – whose history is rife with criminal activity, including bribing of doctors and unethical and dishonest clinical trial practices – stated that their COVID shot, called COMIRNATY®, “is the first and only COVID-19 vaccine to be granted FDA approval for adolescents 12 years and older, following emergency use authorization in May 2021.”\n\nThe move is certainly not without criticism. Children’s Health Defense president Mary Holland was quoted as saying that the FDA “failed to convene an expert committee and failed to appropriately weigh the risk-benefit profile of this vaccine for this age group. Even Vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit acknowledged FDA decisions are being made based on political pressure, not science when, in commenting on the agency’s vote last week to allow reformulated booster shots, he said it felt like ‘the fix was in.’”\n\nPfizer itself says that this decision was largely based on data showing that the COVID shots provoked a strong immune response and high antibody levels in adolescents “one month after the second dose.” Notice how easily Pfizer (and the FDA) ignore the fact that this immune response wanes incredibly quickly not long after a month out in virtually all other age groups.\n\nThey also ignore the fact that just because a drug provokes a strong immune response does not necessarily mean there’s any clinical significance to such an observation – in other words, having high levels of antibodies doesn’t necessarily prove that a person is any more protected against COVID-19 than they would have been without the shot. Even members of the FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) have acknowledged this oversight.\n\nAnd to think that “public health” officials want to expose American adolescents to such uncertainties and grey areas?\n\nPlenty of other glaring issues surrounding this new FDA approval of COVID-19 shots for kids and teens\n\nAside from relying on questionable interpretations of clinical data, both Pfizer and FDA have made several other unusual moves in their quest to approve these shots for younger and younger kids. Among these moves:\n\nPfizer cited old data on 16- to 25-year-olds (pre-Delta and Omicron) while arguing their case for getting their mRNA shot approved for the 12- to 15-year-old age group\n\nCOMIRNATY is not yet available in the U.S. , Children’s Health Defense notes – any pharmacy, hospital, or clinic is still giving out the unapproved and “legally distinct” version of the shot, which is available under Emergency Authorization Use (EUA) only\n\n, Children’s Health Defense notes – any pharmacy, hospital, or clinic is still giving out the unapproved and “legally distinct” version of the shot, which is available under Emergency Authorization Use (EUA) only The Pfizer COVID shot available under EUA does not even have the same clinical formula as its FDA-approved version – COMIRNATY contains a compound called tromethamine (Tris) buffer, which is considered a category C drug. So far, no studies have been done to determine the safety of this new formula (which will become relevant when and if COMIRNATY is actually made available).\n\nLike many, Holland believes this lightning-quick FDA approval “is a move by Pharma to ensure liability protection.” It’s a nod to the fact that Pfizer can’t be sued for damages caused by its COVID-19 shots if the shots become a part of the childhood vaccine schedule recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as stipulated by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.\n\nWe are reluctant to see how long it will take the FDA and its Big Pharma Buddies to fully approve these gene-based shots for kids under 12. But, at this point, it really just seems like a matter of time, regardless of what the safety data indicates.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nPfizer.com\n\nWPXI.com\n\nReliefweb.int\n\nFDA.gov\n\nTheguardian.com\n\nDrugs.com"

        "(NaturalHealth365) As we continue to report on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic, we’re beginning to realize there’s so much more to 2019-nCoV than mainstream media would have you believe. We only need to start with the virus’s origin story to start pulling back the layers of deception and misinformation.\n\nAs we’ve stated in an earlier article, the prevalent theory has been that the coronavirus began in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Now, blistering new revelations from an American bioweapons expert shatter this theory and point to a much more sinister beginning for the virus, which has amassed a current death toll of over 800 people.\n\nDeadly virus created in a Wuhan laboratory, says U.S. international law professor – a laboratory specially designated by the World Health Organization\n\nDr. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He holds multiple prestigious degrees, including a doctor of law degree from Harvard Law School and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He’s best known for drafting The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.\n\nIn a recent interview published on January 30 to YouTube, Dr. Boyle gave a detailed account of how 2019-nCoV didn’t originate in the wet market of the Hubei province. Was the virus ever actually present in the market, and could its presence have accelerated the rapid viral outbreak? Absolutely, Dr. Boyle and others argue.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the virus actually began there.\n\nSo, where did this dangerous strain of coronavirus begin? Dr Boyle contends that the virus was manufactured and bio-engineered in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory – a laboratory that just so happens to be located directly in Wuhan.\n\nThis laboratory is specially designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the only lab in China that can contain and work with the world’s deadliest viruses. Dr. Boyle asserts this is proof that the WHO knows far more about the outbreak than they are letting on.\n\nThe allegation is consistent with a January 2020 paper published by The Lancet, which found that more than a third of the patients tested in their sample had NO contact with the Wuhan wet market, including “Patient Zero.”\n\nIn other words, growing evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory and into the surrounding community, where it would go on to infect thousands of unsuspecting people – a number that’s steadily rising.\n\nNow scrambling to contain the epidemic, the Chinese government initially tried to cover it up. They even threatened and attempted to silence a Chinese doctor named Li Wenliang who first warned of the coming outbreak.\n\nSadly, breaking reports tell us that Wenliang succumbed to the virus on February 7.\n\nNew coronavirus has links to manufactured SARS virus, HIV virus\n\nWhy manufacture and design a lethal and unprecedented virus? Simple, Dr. Boyle asserts: to create biological weapons for warfare.\n\nIn the interview (which hopefully won’t be removed from YouTube), he hypothesizes that WHO-affiliated Wuhan scientists genetically tinkered with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV) until it became the monstrosity it is now (2019-nCoV). The current coronavirus reportedly has a 15 percent greater fatality rate and 83 percent greater infection rate than SARS did, which ransacked the world in 2002 to 2004.\n\nDr. Boyle also cites evidence indicating that Chinese officials smuggled coronavirus materials out of a Canadian lab that’s known for leading research, development, and testing of biological warfare weapons.\n\nAdditionally, a team of Indian virologists just revealed in a January 2020 paper that the 2019-nCoV shares an “uncanny similarity” of genetic inserts with the virus that causes AIDS. (Their paper has been withdrawn…another thinly-veiled cover up attempt?)\n\nTellingly, Chinese doctors have reportedly been using the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir as an off-label treatment for people with 2019-nCoV…so clearly there’s no denying at least some link between these two viruses.\n\nMeanwhile, other scientists seem to be wasting no time to continue tinkering with viruses and trying to capitalize on the outbreak.\n\nIn an article published by CNN on February 7, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, states rather bluntly: “What’s important is that as a global community we maximize our effort to get a vaccine available in the shortest possible time.” Big Pharma experts are hopeful that a vaccine will be available as soon as 2021 – “faster than it’s been done before,” brags Shattock.\n\nStay tuned for regular updates about the coronavirus and more tips on keeping your family healthy.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nGreatgameindia.com\n\nCDC.gov\n\nWSJ.com\n\nBusinessinsider.com\n\nReuters.com\n\nLivescience.com\n\nTheLancet.com\n\nLaw.illinois.edu\n\nBiorxiv.org"

        "(NaturalHealth365) Will a COVID-19 vaccine return us to a sense of “normalcy,” quelling the global pandemic and putting an end to one of the worst years in human history? Or, is it destined to be just another rabbit hole in which roll-out and distribution are a logistical nightmare, negative side effects more common than initially predicted, and where pharma giants make huge profits from free-riding on research carried out by the public sector?\n\nEven worse, thought of by many people, this “solution” could very well be part of a depopulation agenda by the global elite. Whatever you think, there is one simple problem being overlooked – that we’ll point out today…\n\nAccording to researchers and environmental health scientists, a successful COVID-19 vaccine could be hindered by the widespread contamination of PFAS chemicals found in everyday products. These man-made chemicals, or forever chemicals, have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s and exist in everything from non-stick pans and waterproof clothes to pizza boxes and fast-food wrappers.\n\n“Forever chemicals” are inside 99% percent of Americans and can influence the results of a COVID-19 vaccine\n\nOnce hailed as a miracle of modern chemistry, PFAS are now a public scourge and national health crisis, having been linked to liver damage, decreased fertility, and cancer. Scientists are now warning that PFAS might reduce the effectiveness of certain administered vaccines.\n\nCurrently, it’s uncertain if PFAS contamination will disrupt the messenger RNA genetic material in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. However, research has shown that children exposed to PFAS had significantly reduced antibody concentrations after given tetanus and diphtheria vaccinations. (Why does this matter? Keep reading…)\n\nHow confident should we be in a vaccine? Take this news with a grain of salt\n\nIn a recent press conference, the German company BioNTech and the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said that their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine outperformed expectations in phase 3, proving 90% effective. BioNTech’s CEO even went so far as to say that the vaccine will “bash the virus over the head.”\n\nOn the surface … this may appear to be positive news. As COVID-19 numbers spike, grim milestones are met (over 250,000 dead in the U.S.) and new lockdowns and restrictions enforced around the world, many people are desperate to see – and believe in – “the light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nBut the idea that forever chemicals might hinder the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine casts a (huge) long shadow, and one can’t help but wonder if two “miracles of modern chemistry” will result in a terrible outcome.\n\nIn critic and essayist Elisa Gabbert’s book on disaster, The Unreality of Memory and other essays, she writes: “My research into past disasters – the plagues and the almost nuclear wars – was often oddly comforting. We’re still here, after all. But I can only take so much comfort in the past. This point in history does feel different, like we’re nearing an event horizon.”\n\nWhat if that event horizon isn’t COVID-19 but the inability to develop a fully effective pharmaceutical “solution” because of the PFAS chemicals we’ve polluted our bodies with? This is exactly the reason why we – at NaturalHealth365 – promote (so strongly) the importance of supporting a strong immune system.\n\nThe point is simple: a strong immune system is your best defense against bacterial and viral infections.\n\nFor more SHOCKING information about PFAS, listen to this highly-informative NaturalHealth365 podcast with Jonathan Landsman and environmental attorney, Robert Bilott.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheguardian.com"

        "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is declaring war on our children and it’s on each of us to be unrelenting as we defend the next generation from Big Pharma and its allies. We must stop the FDA’s attack, beginning with a campaign to end unethical and unsubstantiated Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) that will subject younger and our most vulnerable children to the unnecessary risks of COVID shots.\n\n\n\nTell the FDA to get their #HandsOffOurChildren and let regulatory authorities know that #ParentsAreWatching.\n\n\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is scheduled to meet on four separate occasions in June to discuss additional EUAs that would provide cradle-to-grave COVID shots and consider a “Future Framework” that will permanently lower the bar for safety and efficacy going forward.\n\n\n\nTheir itinerary is as follows:\n\n\n\n• June 7 — Emergency Use Authorization for Novavax’s COVID shot for adults.\n\n\n\n• June 14 — Amendment to Moderna's EUA to include primary series for children and adolescents 6 years through 17 years of age.\n\n\n\n• June 15 — Amendment to Moderna’s EUA to include primary series for children 6 months to 5 years and amendment to Pfizer’s EUA to include the primary series to children 6 months through 4 years of age.\n\n\n\n• June 28 — Proposed “Future Framework” for COVID shots.\n\n\n\nDr. Toby Rogers aptly calls the June meetings a “blitzkrieg” because it is an overwhelming all-out attack (on informed consent) designed to create psychological shock and demoralizing chaos. But we can change the outcome by arming up with real data and creating a blitzkrieg of our own.\n\n\n\nWe need Defenders like YOU to hold the line and stop the approval of EUA amendments that profoundly impact the health and safety of our kids. Tell VRBPAC members that:\n\n\n\n▶︎ THERE IS NO COVID EMERGENCY FOR CHILDREN.\n\nChildren under 18 with no comorbidities have virtually no risk of death. They have a 99.995% recovery rate and the vast majority of children have minimal symptoms. A study published in Nature described how children between 3 and 11 years of age mount effective, robust and sustained immune responses to COVID. The CDC’s own data show that at least 75.2% of children ages 0 to 11 years and 74.2% of adolescents ages 12 to 17 years already have superior natural immunity.\n\n\n\n▶︎ mRNA SHOTS OFFER LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PROTECTION.\n\nThere is no clinically significant health benefit from the mRNA vaccines. Moderna’s own press release acknowledges that “the absence of any severe disease, hospitalization or death in the study precludes the assessment of vaccine efficacy against these endpoints.” Preliminary data showed the shots were only about 44% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in children 6 months to 2 years old, and 37% effective in children ages 2 to 5 — both below the 50% level that regulators had generally called the minimum level for EUA approval in 2020. In New York, officials observed that Pfizer’s efficacy against Omicron plummeted from 68% to 12% after 7 weeks in children ages 5 to 11.\n\n\n\n▶︎ INJURIES FROM COVID SHOTS IN CHILDREN ARE CATASTROPHIC.\n\nVaccinated children face a substantial risk of myocarditis. Moderna’s EUA application, originally filed in June 2021, has already been held up because of a clear safety signal for myocarditis, which has prompted a number of European countries to prohibit its use in young people. Additionally, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) has over 48,500 reports of adverse events in children, including 112 deaths (as of May 20, 2022) and a growing number of reports of encephalopathies, clotting issues, diabetes and neurological issues in children following COVID shots.\n\n\n\nThe FDA is poised to make decisions regarding our children and the future of this country that may have a devastating impact on children’s health.\n\n\n\nPlease use the button at the top of this page to send a message to FDA and CDC officials, VRBPAC members and elected representatives demanding that they reject the Pfizer and Moderna EUAs for children and ensure our government agencies are following the science."

        "The recent brief heatwave in the U.K. and parts of Europe provides a textbook case of how the weather is being catastrophised to serve the interests of the command-and-control Net Zero agenda. The U.K. heatwave was exceptionally hot, but according to Professor Cliff Mass, this “extraordinary extreme event” is a sign that ”global warming played a very small role in this event”.\n\nAccording to Mass, the golden rule of climate extremes is: “The more extreme a climate or weather record is, the greater the contribution of natural variability and the smaller the contribution of human-caused global warming.”\n\nMass is Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington. He does not rule out the involvement of human-caused global warming, but is dismissive of much of the ludicrous scaremongering that dominates the media. “The truth and overwhelming evidence provide a different story: the recent European heatwave is mainly the result of natural processes, but was enhanced modestly by human-caused global warming,” he writes.\n\nOf course the term “modestly” is being fiercely debated by many scientists. To date, there is no credible science paper that has conclusively linked single weather events to long-term changes in the climate. But, of course, this doesn’t stop the BBC’s green activist-in-residence Justin Rowlatt quoting the opinion from the Met Office that the recent extreme heat was made “ten times” more likely because of climate change. Far from questioning this statement, Rowlatt added: “We are being warned that it can pose a life-threatening risk to even normally healthy people and just look at the impact it is having in our hospitals, schools and transport systems.”\n\nRowlatt saw no need to provide a detailed meteorological explanation for the high temperatures. According to Professor Mass it was caused by a large ridge of high pressure, which produced warming by sinking and moving air northwards on its western flanks. Meanwhile, a trough of lower pressure on the southwest side in Europe enhanced the southerly flow, and acted as a supercharger for the warmth.\n\nIronically, notes Mass, such a pattern, as shown above, produces enhanced cooling to the east and west. Needless to say, this was rarely, if ever, mentioned in the relentless media concentration on the localised heat. But Mass is clear about the ridge: “There is no evidence that the ridge in question resulted from global warming.”\n\nSimilar climate agitprop was evident last year in North America when it was struck by a heatwave in the northeast. Again, talk of Thermogeddon ‘heat domes’ was common across the media. Now, says Mass, “a shocker”. Below is the same kind of chart for this heatwave.\n\n“OMG! Very similar, including the low to the southwest,” notes Mass.\n\nThe U.S. meteorologist Anthony Watts is another person to bring some scientific sanity to discussion of the recent heatwave. “Each of these stories trying to link climate change to the heatwave does so without any proof whatsoever. They are nothing more than speculative fearmongering,” he said. Fearmongering he might have had in mind would include Piers Morgan who told TalkTV that we could be “heading for an apocalypse”, and BBC weatherman Ben Rich, who was of the opinion that “it feels like a tipping point”.\n\nPublishing the BBC photo featured at the top of this article, he noted that TV stations were using colour “to make it seem like a crisis”. He also drew attention to the dramatic temperature differences across the UK and Europe as a “sure sign of this being a weather pattern, and not global scale climate change, aka global warming as the media would have you believe”. The same, he added, applied to last year’s northeast heatwave in the United States. Indeed, he went on to note that in recent decades, heatwaves in the US had been far less frequent and severe than they were in the 1930s.\n\nWatts has researched and written extensively on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect for many years. In 2017 he wrote that the majority of weather measuring centres used by NOAA in the U.S. had been compromised by UHI. “The result is an inflated temperature that needs to be corrected,” he said. Estimates of the UHI effect in cities vary, but often reach a number of degrees centigrade. “If this were forensic science, such polluted and corrupted data would be tossed out as being unsuitable for the purpose of making a legal decision. Yet entire economies and national policies are being modified based on trends seen in the data, as well as the future projections. When science refuses to own up to bad data, it is no longer science”, he charged.\n\nAs the Daily Sceptic recently reported, about half of all land surface temperature measurements used to promote the fading global warming scare are now taken near or adjacent to airport runways. Adjustments are made to the raw data, but – some might say mysteriously – the recent temperatures are all continually adjusted upwards, and historic recordings moved downwards. As a result, the three main datasets run by NASA, the Met Office and the NOAA now show an obvious disconnect with accurate satellite and meteorological balloon recordings.\n\nThe atmospheric scientists Professors William Happer and Richard Lindzen didn’t pull any punches over the changes when they recently told the U.S. Government that over the last several decades, “NASA and NOAA have been fabricating temperature data to argue that raising CO 2 levels have led to the hottest year on record”. The large adjustments meant they were “totally inconsistent” with other temperature data. What was claimed to be false and manipulated data, was said to be an “egregious violation of the scientific method”.\n\nWatts concluded his recent thoughts on the U.K.’s heatwave by noting that it is well known that UHI can contribute to warmer temperatures. He noted that the population of the U.K. had increased by 11 million people since the hot summer of 1976, and it is not in the least bit surprising that UHI increased as infrastructure was built to support the rise. The BBC is said to have reported that the record recent high U.K. temperature was recorded at Coningsby in Lincolnshire [some reports said it was the village of Coningsby] but what it didn’t tell you was that the record was set at RAF Coningsby, “next to the heat absorbing sea of runway asphalt and tarmac”.\n\nAs the Daily Sceptic noted, in joint second place for the temperature record was Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. Also in second place was Kew Gardens in London, which prompted numerous social media critics to inquire if there was a runway in the park. There is not, but the Met Office co-ordinates do place the measuring device about 150m from the Palm House. This is an ornate, tropical greenhouse with 16,000 panes of glass, measuring 62 feet high and 362 feet long. It does not seem the most obvious structure to have next to a temperature measurer.\n\nChris Morrison is the Daily Sceptic’s Environment Editor."

        "Bone Broth Protein laboratory testing results from the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. (October 5, 2017) - The non-profit Consumer Wellness Center has completed testing of eight popular bone broth and bone broth protein products to determine the possible presence of chemical pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, toxicological chemicals and food additive chemicals.\n\nNo companies paid the CWC to be included or excluded from these tests. All products were purchased from Amazon.com in the year 2017. Lot numbers of each product tested are included in the full results. No one involved in this testing has any financial stake in the success or failure of any bone broth product.\n\nTests were conducted by CWClabs.com, an ISO-accredited analytical laboratory headed by Mike Adams, author of Food Forensics. Adams is a published science author whose papers have appeared in the LC/GC science journal and the Natural Science Journal. Adams is noted for co-developing a pioneering LC-MS-TOF method for quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts. He's also an inventor with two patents approved by the U.S. patent office; one patent describes an invention for the removal of radioactive cesium isotopes from the human body following nuclear events. Another patent describes an invention for removing toxic heavy metals from the digestive tract through the use of ion exchange technology.\n\nAs a pioneer in forensic food science, Adams has also spearheaded science warnings over lead in rice protein products and zeolites \"detox\" supplements. Adams does not sell bone broth products and has no financial conflicts of interest with the bone broth product industry.\n\nChemical analytes were confirmed using five different scientific analysis methods. Those methods, encompassed in LC-MS-TOF analysis, include accurate mass, retention time, isotopic ratios, isotopic spacing and ion fragmentation \"fingerprint\" analysis. Adams explains the science behind the analysis in a one-hour press release video to be posted at ConsumerWellness.org.\n\nA summary of the findings is offered below, but full details of the results are being released exclusively through Good Gopher Mail, a free online email system developed by Adams to bypass scientific censorship of Google, Facebook and other internet gatekeepers that routinely censor science conducted in the public interest. Users may sign up for new Good Gopher Mail accounts at GoodGopher.com.\n\nBone broth product brands tested\n\nAncient Nutrition\n\nJarrow Formulas\n\nSports Research\n\nPrecisionNaturals\n\nLeft Coast\n\nLonoLife\n\nUpdate and page modification: 10/11/2017\n\nAfter reviewing consumer feedback about the lab tests, Consumer Wellness Center has learned that many people are misinterpreting these results, and some are taking them out of context. For this reason, we have edited this page to remove chemistry details that we believe may be confusing to consumers, and we are working on a simpler system for communicating the scientific testing results with the public (perhaps a red / yellow / green light system based on lab testing results).\n\nTo clarify, these tests were conducted on non-organic products derived from animals, and in that category almost every product on the shelf will likely show trace amounts of antibiotics, insecticides and certain pharmacological drugs. These are widely used throughout the animal-based food supply, and many of those chemicals remain intact through processing and packaging.\n\nAnother important point is that the chemicals originally detected were not ingredients nor overwhelming signals that would indicate any sort of acute health risk or illegality. Although this was stated in the CWC video, at no point did the CWC assert that the products tested were acutely dangerous or running afoul of FDA regulations. The FDA allows astonishing levels of many chemicals in non-organic products, and this is frequently reflected and affirmed in scientific lab testing results.\n\nFinally, we don't wish for CWC lab testing results to be mis-appropriated or mis-used by non-science-trained members of the public to inaccurately describe the composition or safety of the products we are testing. Based on public feedback, we have come to realize that those who are not trained in analytical food science testing are often not able to properly grasp or communicate risk vs. safety when it comes to chemical exposure. For these reasons, we are working on an improved way to communicate our findings to the public without running the risk of people misinterpreting the results we publish. We also believe that food manufacturers will find our signaling system easier to understand and thus more \"fair\" when it comes to how the public perceives the results.\n\nThank you for your understanding. Our aim is to help consumers make informed, science-based decisions on the products they wish to purchase or avoid. The simpler we can make the signaling on all this, the more effective we think this program will be.\n\nWe are also currently testing organic varieties of bone broth products, and we hope to share those results with the public in just a few days. We hope to bring you positive news on those products in the very near future.\n\n###\n\nMore News & Press Releases"

        "Pioneering citizen scientists launch non-profit water testing initiative to test every U.S. city water supply for lead\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. (February 16, 2016) - Two citizen scientists who lead a non-profit food and water laboratory in central Texas have teamed up to prevent children across America from being poisoned with lead in municipal water supplies. Forensic food scientist Mike Adams has teamed with a former NASA contract scientist to conduct nationwide scientific analysis of heavy metals in the tap water of U.S. cities. The effort is being organized by the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (ConsumerWellness.org), with executive director Mike Adams leading the scientific analysis. Over the next three months, the team plans to test the water of at least 100 large U.S. cities, reporting the results to the public on the website EPAwatch.org. The water tests are being conducted via ICP-MS using an Agilent 7700x instrument and EPA methodology 200.8. Analysis is sensitive to low parts per billion concentrations for lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, copper and other toxic elements. Results will be published on EPAwatch.org and NaturalNews.com.\n\n\"In the spirit of citizen science and the democratization of science, we are taking on this task because the EPA has failed the citizens of Flint, Michigan,\" explained Adams. \"When government regulators refuse to do their jobs, it is the duty and responsibility of citizen scientists to take on that task in the public interest. The health and lives of millions of children are at stake,\" Adams explains. \"We don't have time to wait for the EPA to someday decide to do its job. We need to protect our children right now.\"\n\nWatch the full EPAwatch announcement video at this link or below:\n\nWater samples for the analysis are being crowdsourced from health professionals across America. A downloadable form (PDF) with instructions is available at this link at EPAwatch.org.\n\nAbout the Lab\n\nOver the last two years, forensic food scientist and clean food activist Mike Adams has built a world-class laboratory with state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation for identifying contaminants in food and water. The lab features ICP-MS, Ion Chromatography, Liquid Chromatography and Time Of Flight Mass Spec instrumentation capable of detecting heavy metals, pesticides, hormone disruptors, fluoride and thousands of other chemical contaminants. The lab is 100% privately funded and receives no grant money from any government entity. Adams, a noted clean food activist, is also the inventor of the Food Rising Mini-Farm Grow Box (FoodRising.org) and holder of two patents related to protection from heavy metals and radioactive water. (HeavyMetalsDefense.com and CesiumEliminator.com.) Adams also conducted all the heavy metals tests of popular water filters shown at WaterFilterLabs.com. He is widely considered one of the world's leading independent voices on food science, nutrition, heavy metals and chemical contaminants.\n\n###\n\nMore News & Press Releases"

        "by Paromita Datta published on - October 05, 2020\n\nCOVID-19 shows a wide range of manifestations among those affected. While some show severe symptoms, many remain asymptomatic. A study carried out by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute shed clarity on why these cases are so variable. It revealed how a subset of patients with an affected immune system shows a severe form of the disease.\n\nPublished under two papers in the journal Science, the study narrowed down two sets of patients with a specific make-up in their immunity system. The first set was of patients with a key mutation in their immunity genes. The second set of patients had auto-antibodies that attack the same areas in the immune system instead of fighting the disease. [1] [2]\n\nThese observations were based on cross-country collaboration of clinicians across the world. The study enrolled people with a severe form of the disease with a plan to study their genetic profile. The number of participants was more than 3000 candidates, enrolled in the period between February and March. As the team analyzed the genetic samples, they observed harmful mutations present in certain patients, both young and old.\n\nOf every 659 patients, 23 carried genetic mutations that are involved in generating the antiviral interferons. This amounts to 3.5 percent of the patients with COVID-19 who showed these mutations. Another 10 percent of the patients showed the creation of auto-antibodies that targeted the immune system.\n\nFor the latest updates on COVID-19, please visit the CDC & NIH. [3] [4]"

        "by Raksha Hegde published on - September 28, 2020\n\nAn online psychological test of university students in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak revealed that all of them were in the clinical range for stress and anxiety. This assessment was completed during a pre-intervention stage of a study on the effects on mind-body intervention for students in week four of quarantine in Italy. Furthermore, the study conducted by the University of Salerno, Italy, published in the Frontiers of Psychology journal, found that the negative affect, which implies feelings of emotional distress, during the pandemic were substantially above average. [1]\n\nIn the assessment, 311 undergraduate and graduate students (mean age of 31.3 years) scored high on selected measures for stress, anxiety, and global distress. The majority of the students in the sample size for this research were female. This is also consistent with the recent studies conducted on undergraduate college students in China and in the US that have found that students are suffering higher levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19-related stressors in these studies generally include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays for university students. The findings of these studies indicate that public health measures are vital to monitor the mental health of students during the pandemic and in its aftermath.

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe roll out of the Monkeypox “Plandemic” has been carefully planned and coordinated, much like the COVID Plandemic of 2020, including having simulations on how this “plandemic” will evolve, much like the 2019 Event 201 which simulated, with almost precision accuracy, how the COVID plandemic would evolve. See:\n\nThis past weekend the World Health Organization officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Kit Knightly of Off-Guardian.org reported:\n\nThe World Health Organization has officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Following their second emergency meeting on monkeypox in less than a month, WHO Director-General Thedros Adhanom told the press: In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations […] For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” For anyone living under a rock for the past two years, a PHEIC is defined as: an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response” It is the highest alert WHO can issue, and grants them legal authority to issue travel warnings or restrictions, inspect and critique the public health measures of member states and other things of that nature. Exactly what that means in this instance, and what form the “coordinated international response” will take, it is currently too early to tell. (Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop “plandemics”:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.”\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.” Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. “I would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven’t been used in this context and in this scale before,” Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé\n\nSee Also:"

        "As the cost of essential goods rises faster than it has in decades, billionaires in the food and energy sectors are increasing their fortunes by $1 billion dollars every two days\n\nby OXFAM, Canada\n\nFor every new billionaire created during the pandemic — one every 30 hours — nearly a million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 at nearly the same rate, reveals a new Oxfam brief today.\n\n“Profiting from Pain” is published as the World Economic Forum in Davos takes place for the first time face-to-face since COVID-19, a period during which billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost to their fortunes.\n\nIn Canada, the wealth of billionaires has increased by 57.1 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic, in March 2020. The 41 richest billionaires own as much as the poorest 40 per cent of Canadians.\n\n“Billionaires gathered in Davos have enjoyed an obscene surge in their fortunes over the last two years. The pandemic and now the steep rise in food and energy prices have been a bonanza for the wealthiest, while millions of people face hunger and poverty as the cost living shoots up,” said Ian Thomson, manager of policy for Oxfam Canada.\n\nThe brief shows that 573 people became new billionaires during the pandemic, at the rate of one every 30 hours. We expect this year that 263 million more people will crash into extreme poverty, at a rate of a million people every 33 hours.\n\nBillionaires’ wealth has risen more in the first 24 months of COVID-19 than in 23 years combined. The total wealth of the world’s billionaires is now equivalent to 13.9 per cent of global GDP. This is a three-fold increase (up from 4.4 per cent) in 2000.\n\n“Billionaire wealth is growing because the super-rich have rigged the system for decades and are now reaping the benefits. The wealthiest — most of whom are men — are benefiting from privatization, pharmaceutical monopolies, fossil fuel subsidies and rollbacks of workers’ rights. Meanwhile, low-income people are working harder and earning less in pay,” said Thomson. “Inequality risks tearing apart our societies if we don’t stop it.”\n\nOxfam’s new research also reveals that corporations in the energy, food and pharmaceutical sectors — where monopolies are especially common — are posting record-high profits, even as wages have barely budged and workers struggle with decades-high prices amid COVID-19. The fortunes of food and energy billionaires have risen by $453 billion in the last two years, equivalent to $1 billion every two days. Five of the world’s largest energy companies (BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and Chevron) are together making $2,600 profit every second, and there are now 62 new food billionaires.\n\nFrom Sri Lanka to Sudan, record-high global food prices are sparking social and political upheaval. Sixty per cent of low-income countries are on the brink of debt distress. While inflation is rising everywhere, price hikes are particularly devastating for low-wage workers whose health and livelihoods were already most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly women, racialized and marginalized people. People in poorer countries spend more than twice as much of their income on food than those in rich countries.\n\nToday, 2,668 billionaires — 573 more than in 2020 — own $12.7 trillion, an increase of $3.78 trillion.\n\nThe world’s 10 richest men own more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of humanity, 3.1 billion people.\n\nThe richest 20 billionaires are worth more than the entire GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA worker in the bottom 50 per cent would have to work for 112 years to earn what a person in the top one per cent gets in a single year.\n\nThe pandemic has created 40 new pharma billionaires. Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer are making $1,000 profit every second just from their monopoly control of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite its development having been supported by billions of dollars in public investments. They are charging governments up to 24 times more than the potential cost of generic production. Eighty-seven per cent of people in low-income countries have still not been fully vaccinated.\n\n“The extremely rich and powerful are profiting from pain and suffering. This is unconscionable. Some have grown rich by denying billions of people access to vaccines, others by exploiting rising food and energy prices. They are paying out massive bonuses and dividends while paying as little tax as possible. This rising wealth and rising poverty are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to do,” said Thomson. “The Canadian government talks a good game about taxing extreme wealth inequality but we need to see more action. In the last two federal budgets, new taxes on luxury goods and increased tax rates on big banks have been announced but not implemented. The true test will be if Canada and other major economies find the political will to finally tax billionaire wealth.”\n\nRead the full report at OXFAM, Canada.\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe roll out of the Monkeypox “Plandemic” has been carefully planned and coordinated, much like the COVID Plandemic of 2020, including having simulations on how this “plandemic” will evolve, much like the 2019 Event 201 which simulated, with almost precision accuracy, how the COVID plandemic would evolve. See:\n\nThis past weekend the World Health Organization officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Kit Knightly of Off-Guardian.org reported:\n\nThe World Health Organization has officially declared the “monkeypox outbreak” a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Following their second emergency meeting on monkeypox in less than a month, WHO Director-General Thedros Adhanom told the press: In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations […] For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.” For anyone living under a rock for the past two years, a PHEIC is defined as: an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response” It is the highest alert WHO can issue, and grants them legal authority to issue travel warnings or restrictions, inspect and critique the public health measures of member states and other things of that nature. Exactly what that means in this instance, and what form the “coordinated international response” will take, it is currently too early to tell. (Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop “plandemics”:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.”\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a “clinical study” for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the “effectiveness of the vaccine.” Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. “I would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven’t been used in this context and in this scale before,” Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a “clinical trial” to determine the vaccine’s efficacy. “And therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,” he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox “outbreak” was reported by The Exposé yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these “outbreaks” of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox “outbreaks,” and “coincidentally” they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n“Monkeypox” is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Exposé\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven’t then you’re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it’s most definitely not because we’re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt’s because we’re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing ‘The Great Reset’.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven’t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don’t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you’re being told is “monkeypox” is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn’t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer’s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but “experts” believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we’re all being told about? It’s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency’s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 –\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn’t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you’re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n“Monkeypox” is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere’s a list of articles relating to just a few examples –\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people’s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won’t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Exposé\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 46,618 deaths and 4,682,268 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines (details below).\n\nIn the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS) is now reporting 29,635 deaths and 1,350,950 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there has been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020. (833,968 cases, 9,279 deaths – source.)\n\n46,618 Deaths and 4,682,268 Injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,618 fatalities, and 4,682,268 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,126,925) are serious injuries.\n\n“Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here.

women. (Source.)\n\nThis has to be the saddest, most criminal activity of Big Pharma and the FDA by allowing these COVID-19 shots to be injected into pregnant and young women.\n\nPfizer had data showing how dangerous these shots were for pregnant women, but the FDA gave authorization anyway.\n\nDr. Byram W. Bridle addressed this human tragedy on his blog earlier this week:\n\nI Am In Shock. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) had requested 75 years to release the documents that they reviewed from Pfizer prior to issuing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b mRNA ‘vaccine’ (Comirnaty) against SARS-CoV-2, which can cause COVID-19. However, a judge over-ruled this and issued a court order that the documents be released in large monthly installments. Today, an absolutely shocking set of data were brought to my attention. They are not new. They are from a document that was in the data dump released back in May of this year. However, I want to help my fellow scientists in making sure that this science gets widely distributed throughout the world. This is for the sake of ‘fully informed consent’, something that regulatory agencies, public health officials and too many physicians seem to have abandoned over the past couple of years. For a long time I have been arguing that our children need to be left out of the massive conflicts over the science underpinning COVID-19. In my opinion, adults can conduct their own risk-benefit analyses regarding whether they want to receive one of the current COVID-19 inoculations. However, far too many adults are making these decisions based on pseudo-science, data from flawed studies, misinformation, and outright disinformation being propagated by physicians and public health officials, many of whom are unqualified to opine on anything in the field of vaccinology. I have never felt comfortable about these injections being used in ‘children, adolescents and young-adults of child-bearing age’. This was the precise terminology I used in a parent’s guide to COVID-19 vaccines that I wrote more than one year ago. The highest quality data for assessing a novel medical product are derived from clinical studies. This is because these types of experiments in people are typically well-controlled and include what is known as ‘active monitoring’; there is follow-up to assess safety and efficacy. This is why the clinical testing phases should never be compromised. With this in mind, let’s explore a stunning set of data that Pfizer provided to the US-FDA. The data in this document were accumulated up until February 28, 2021. Notably, on page 9, safety concerns based on the US Pharmacovigilance Plan included “missing information” on “Use in Pregnancy and lactation”. The data that had accumulated up to the end of February, 2021 were from too small of a sample size (i.e., # of pregnant or lactating women) to justify its use in these populations. However, here are the data that were available at that time regarding outcomes in pregnant women that had received Pfizer’s COVID-19 inoculation; this is quoted from the top of table 6 (I have italicized and/or bolded the most important points)… Pregnancy cases: 274 cases including: • 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3 mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins). • Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted). Apparently, outcomes will never be known for 88% (238/270) of the pregnancies. Why was the follow-up rate on these cases so abysmal? NutriTruth has a great graph on their website that summarizes the results from cases for which follow-up data were available… It appears that data would be available for five of the pregnancies, but these outcomes were still unknown at the time that Pfizer’s document was written. As such, there are solid data available from 29 pregnancies. One out of 29 of these pregnancies resulted in a ‘normal’ outcome. This means that 28 out of the 29 babies died! That is a 97% death rate. I don’t care which trustworthy data set you look at to determine a ‘background’ death rate, none of them come close to 97%. Spontaneous abortions are more common than many people appreciate, but, again, they are nowhere near the rate in this study. Even in the case of the ‘normal outcome’, this means there was an apparently healthy baby. However, one cannot be certain that the outcome was ‘normal’, until the baby has had all of their physiological systems fully mature, which means early adulthood. I have looked at Pfizer’s pre-clinical reproductive toxicity data and they are fatally flawed. Issues included ‘vaccinating’ the females only; apparently it was forgotten that ‘it takes two to tango’. Also, the rodent models that were used express the low-affinity version of the receptor for the spike protein encoded by the ‘vaccines’. People express the high-affinity receptor. This means the rodent models aren’t capable of revealing toxicities that might be associated with the spike protein. In short, the pre-clinical studies could provide no assurance whatsoever that Pfizer’s vaccine would be safe in the context of pregnancy. Now there is proof that data were in the hands of regulatory agencies that suggested the potential for a 97% fatality rate for babies from ‘vaccinated’ women. I have collaborated with scientists and physicians about the post-rollout ‘real-world’ studies on pregnancy and the COVID-19 shots. They are highly flawed. I co-authored a paper about this, but have yet to find an editor that will even allow it to undergo peer review (I have had no problems with this for any of my cancer- or basic virology-focused papers). Regardless, many other reputable scientists and physicians have been addressing this. Further, these ‘real-world’ studies should never have been authorized based on the data presented here. Many countries have pushed Pfizer’s COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ on pregnant women, often via mandates. This was been done with the full blessing of their societies for obstetrics and gynecology. Are obstetricians and gynecologists going to continue to make these recommendations with these data in-hand? At the end of the day, couples experiencing pregnancies or who wish to do so must make it their own responsibility to educate themselves to facilitate fully informed consent. Too many obstetricians and gynecologists are either too superficially trained in the immunological sub-discipline of vaccinology or are too afraid of contradicting a narrative for which dissent is punished. Some physicians are starting to speak up about this. Unfortunately, their singular personal observations are simply deemed anecdotal. However, as a scientist, I have been trained to observe the cumulative nature of these reports; to not dismiss them out-of-hand, and to use them to formulate legitimate scientific questions. If you or your baby have experienced any issues post-inoculation, please report these to your physician. They are obligated to submit an adverse event report, without opining on whether or not they think it might or might not be related. The accumulation of these reports is the only way scientists can help identify safety signals during a public rollout of a novel medical product. A 97% death rate among babies from pregnant mothers that were ‘vaccinated’ is appalling. And this was from Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. This suggests a massive breakdown in the health regulatory process. The public, whom health regulatory agencies are to be serving, should demand accountability from these government-run institutions. If I were a regulatory scientist assessing the pregnancy outcome data from Pfizer, there is no way that I would ever have supported the use of their inoculation in pregnant women. And I would never have allowed ‘real-world’ data from flawed studies to replace proper pre-clinical and clinical trials. Nor would I remain silent about this knowledge. Regulators who know better need to start speaking up.\n\nRead the full article at COVID Chronicles.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper was recently interviewed where she stated:\n\n“For a first-trimester woman to get this injection, they have more of a chance of having a miscarriage or stillbirth than if they were to actually take an abortifacient.”\n\n2 Young Mothers Talk About Losing Their Unborn Babies Just After a COVID-19 Vaccine:\n\nReports of Brain Damage, Seizures, Bowel Disease Continue for Babies 6 Months Old to 4 Years Old\n\nAnother 103 records of COVID-19 vaccine injuries were added to VAERS yesterday (July 22, 2022) for the 6-month to 4-years-old age group, continuing to show horrible side effects that include brain injuries, anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, eye infections, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes, since these shots were approved for this age group a few weeks ago, in June.\n\nI put the latest 103 records on the second page here. I read through every one of them, and I have to admit that emotionally, it is not an easy thing to do.\n\nSome “highlights” from the write-ups of these infants who were injected.\n\nA 6-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2370120:\n\nwithin 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing; within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend and describes the occurrence of RESPIRATORY ARREST – On 30-Jun-2022, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening) and LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant).\n\nA 4-year-old boy from VAERS ID 2369485:\n\nThursday, July 7th, I picked him up from school and walked him home. He only ate part of his fig bar because he said it didn”t taste good. He also didn”t want any dinner which is very rare. He said that his tummy hurt. I assumed it was the fig bar. He finally ate 2 bites of soup but didn”t want any more. When I brushed his teeth I only brushed half because he said it hurt. He went to bed pretty easily but he looked so exhausted. About 10:00pm he woke up and he was sweaty and clammy. He wasn”t feeling well and seemed a bit delirious because he didn”t realize I was really in the room with him as I rocked him. He cried about his tummy hurting and pointed to below his belly button. He cried and said he wanted to go home. He didn”t realize he was home.\n\nA 3-year-old girl from VAERS ID 2366237:\n\nThe night of the vaccine, she developed a fever and woke up. She has had a fever ever since the vaccine. She is lethargic and will not eat. I took her to the urgent care on 7/8/2022. She had a strep and COVID-19 test that were negative. Her highest fever was 104. I also took her to the ER yesterday. She is currently still sick.\n\nA one and a half year old boy from VAERS ID 2365977:\n\nAfter receiving vaccination, patient was out of it for approximately ~15 mins, after that period seemed lethargic but otherwise normal. Patient showed no other adverse reaction until time for his nap at 12:40p, when he felt warm to the touch but underarm temperature reading was 98.7. He woke up atypically early at 2:50p, but laid in crib seemingly playing quietly. At 3:56p, mother heard whimpering sound and went to check on patient who was convulsing and unconscious until EMS arrived at 4:03p, he was very hot but EMS was unable to get an accurate temperature reading. Convulsions stopped when paramedics arrived at approx. 4:03p and patient was unresponsive for an additional approx. 10 mins. Patient was placed under ice by EMS and had a temperature reading of 102.4 when he arrived Hospital in approx 20-30 mins later.\n\nA six-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2362981:\n\n24 hours post-vaccine baby had a BRUE (brief resolved unexplained event). While changing his diaper he went unresponsive and I questioned if he was breathing. I startled him back with shouting his name. He then became unresponsive again. This occurred 4-5 times over 1-2 minutes. I attempted startling and tryingg go to get a reaction and he became alert again. I took him to the ER where he was diagnosed as having a BRUE and was kept on monitors overnight.\n\nI shudder to think what awaits those in the future who allow these little ones to suffer so much. “Vengeance is mine” says the Lord, and there will be justice.\n\nRescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nIn a sign that perhaps even the pro-pharma pro-vaccine medical professionals are starting to get tired of the constant COVID hype and are beginning to speak out against health politicians who are appointed bureaucrats and never elected by the people to their public office, LA County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brad Spellberg went public recently to humiliate Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer’s announcement that COVID-19 cases were on the rise and new face mask mandates were needed soon.\n\nKaty Grimes of The Globe reports:\n\n…. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer’s announcement on Thursday that Los Angeles County has officially reached the “High” level of new COVID-19 cases and County hospitalization rates, giving the County two weeks to fall back below or else mandatory indoor masking mandates return… In a news conference on July 13, Brad Spellberg, the chief medical officer of Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center, and epidemiologist Paul Holtom, said that there have been no changes in the transmission levels of COVID-19. “Our Covid situation – it’s just the same. It has not changed,” Spellberg said. He showed a graph and said, “it’s plateaued and has not gone down.” Dr. Spellberg said they are seeing thousands of people with Covid, “but it is mild, and they go home,” he said. He said of the patients who are admitted to the hospital, “90% of the time it is not due to Covid. Only 10% of our Covid-positive admissions are due to Covid.” “None of them go to the ICU, and when they do, it is not for pneumonia,” he added. “They are not intibated. We have not seen one of those since February.” “A lot of people have really bad colds is what we are seeing, Spellberg said. “’It is just not the same pandemic that it was, despite all the media hype to the contrary… I mean … a lot of people have bad colds is what we’re seeing,” Spellberg added.” (Full article.)\n\nLater in the day today, Grimes published a second article at The Globe regarding the reaction of the Health Department, which of course must have a public “health crisis” at all times always to justify their bloated budget and reason for existence.\n\nIt appears there must have been some significant blowback against Los Angeles County over of the information provided by the two surprisingly forthright LA County+USC physicians on Sunday, as the Globe reported Monday in LA County Chief Medical Officer Rejects COVID-19 ‘Media Hype’. We reported that the two LA doctors rejected Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer’s statements about another wave of COVID-19 hitting the region as “media hype.” The L.A. County Department of Health issued a statement Monday, clearly indignant that people shared the video on social media and in news articles of the two doctors rejecting the claims that hospitalizations are up, and that Covid is still very serious. Ferrer has been teasing that with the impending “high” level of COVID-19 transmission,” indoor mask mandates will likely come back. But as is her way, she never offered any details about whether or not people who were hospitalized were sick with Covid or from Covid – or if they were not sick much at all. The letter is almost funny claiming that it is because of the vaccines that people aren’t hospitalized. Sure. “Importantly, one of the reasons we are seeing low rates of ICU admission currently is due to high rates of vaccination across Los Angeles County,” the unsigned letter from LA County Health Services says. It’s almost as if these two doctors may have exposed the Los Angeles County Medical Industrial Complex. (Full article.)\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nWe are now seeing more records of side effects from the pediatric COVID-19 vaccines for the most recent age group authorized by the FDA, babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old. This age group was authorized to be injected with COVID-19 vaccines less than 1 month ago, on June 17th.\n\nIn the most recent update to the national Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database this past Friday (July 8, 2022), 123 new records were added to this age group, with 137 cases now recorded since the FDA authorization. (Source.)\n\nAs we reported on July 6th, when the first few cases were beginning to show up in VAERS for the babies and toddlers, hallucinations are a very troubling side effect in this very young age group.\n\nWith these 137 cases recorded in the past few weeks, other troubling side effects including brain injuries, seizures, and skin rashes are showing up in the database.\n\n27 of the 137 cases listed “Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome” as a side effect.\n\nCleveland Clinic defines “Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome” as:\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare and life-threatening reaction to the use of any neuroleptic medication. Neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotic medications, treat and manage symptoms of many psychiatric conditions. (Source.)\n\nI am tempted to write my emotional reaction to this news, but I want to keep this clean and G-rated.\n\nWhat kind of parent would willingly inject their baby with something that has the same “rare and life-threatening reaction” as antipsychotic drugs?? No wonder some of these babies and toddlers are hallucinating!\n\nOther side effects among these first 137 cases recorded in VAERS for babies and toddlers who are injected with the COVID-19 vaccines are: anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes. (Source.)\n\nThe most common reason for recording a case to submit to VAERS for this age group, by far, is “medication error,” where the pharmacist or doctor injected the baby with the wrong dose, either an adult dose, or a dose for an older child.\n\nSuch gross incompetency among medical staff should not surprise us, since most of the good, ethical doctors have quit or been fired over their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, or inject others with one. The ones remaining are either vaccine zealots, or worse, they know full well that these vaccines are killing and harming children, but they fear losing their job more than standing up for what is right.\n\nAs I read through the write-ups of each of these cases, it is clear that many of the toddlers are putting up a fight to resist being injected, but if it results in only getting a partial dose of the vaccine, they just inject them again.\n\nI also noted in several of the write-ups that instead of referring to the “parent” of the child, reference is made to the “guardian,” which suggests that some of these babies and toddlers are in the foster care system, where their “guardians” have no choice but to inject their “foster children” because the child is technically a ward of the State, and the State has the right to administer any medical procedure, even experimental ones, without parental notification.\n\nPlease pray for America’s children, as the United States is one of the few, if not only, places in the world where babies this young are being injected with these toxic shots.\n\nThose who are participating in this Satanic ritual will be held accountable at some point, and the Judge of the universe will not accept ignorance as an excuse, even if your “pastor,” or the nurse or doctor at your church, told you that these vaccines are “safe,” and you trusted them.\n\nChristian churches are one of the most dangerous places for children today, because if you refuse to submit to the Satanic practice of vaccinating your child, you risk being reported to CPS and having your child medically kidnapped where they will remove them from your home and put them into a nice “Christian” foster home where they will receive all recommended medical procedures.\n\nRescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 46,160 deaths and 4,623,724 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines, while the United States’ Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS) is now reporting 29,162 deaths and 1,314,594 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nWe know that as huge as these numbers are which are official government statistics, that they only represent a very small fraction of the total number of deaths and injuries suffered by those who chose to receive COVID-19 vaccines during the past 18 months.\n\nLast year, Dr. Jessica Rose did a comprehensive analysis to determine the “under-reported factor” in VAERS, and came up with 41X, meaning that the recorded data for adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in VAERS had to be multiplied by 41 to get more accurate numbers. See:\n\nHowever, now that more time has elapsed since this study was performed, many feel that 41X is significantly too low, and should be closer to 100X, which is the number that was previously used based on a 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nSo if we take the publicly available data from VAERS and the European EMA and multiply by 100, these would be the true numbers of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines: 7,532,200 deaths and 593,831,800 injuries in Europe and the U.S.\n\n46,160 deaths and 4,623,724 injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,160 fatalities, and 4,623,724 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,106,816) are serious injuries.\n\n“Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started publishing this, others from Europe have also calculated the numbers and confirmed the totals.*\n\nHere is the summary data through July 2, 2022.\n\nTotal reactions for the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran

The fatalities are grouped by symptoms, and some fatalities may have resulted from multiple symptoms.\n\nParents Offer Up Their Babies and Toddlers to the Demonic Vaccine Cult – Hallucinations Among Reported Side Effects\n\nLast month (June, 2022) the FDA gave parents authorization to start offering their babies and toddlers to the COVID-19 Vaccine Cult, and injections began in children under the age of 5.\n\nThere are currently 476 cases of COVID-19 injuries in this age group in VAERS (source), although many of these cases were before the authorization was given.\n\nI have listed all current 476 cases on one page that can be viewed here. The most current cases, after the authorization, can be seen at the bottom.\n\nRemarkably, many of the cases listed prior to the authorization, were entries made by health officials because after injecting the child, they found out that the child was under the age of 5, and not yet authorized to receive the shots.\n\nIn other words, the parents were so desperate to inject their toddlers, that they lied about their child’s age to get the shot, which would have been a dose made for older children, and the health official felt compelled to enter it into VAERS to cover themselves legally after they found out.\n\nStaff was misled by mother, regarding the patient”s age. This resulted in the child being vaccinated despite bing ineligible (due to being 4). The vaccination process otherwise went without incident. Patient was observation for approx. 15 minutes after, in accordance with current guidelines. Afterwards, the patient left with her mother again without incident. (VAERS ID 2264666) The patient received a pediatric Pfizer Covid vaccine, but she is only 4 years old, which is under the approved age. The parents falsified the child”s date of birth during check in and on the paperwork. They called the pharmacy the next day (4/21/22) to apologize and let us know that she was actually under age. There were no adverse effects reported during the time of the vaccine, at the time of the phone call on 4/21/22 or at the time of the follow up call on 4/25/22. (VAERS ID 2250179) Patient falsified DOB when registering for vaccination, stating the minor was born 10 days earlier than actual DOB. Guardian consented to the vaccination. Department of Health verified with statistical records the patients actual DOB, which made the vaccine a contraindication. No known adverse reactions noted. (VAERS ID 2283077)\n\nIn at least one case, a doctor approved the shot even though it was not yet authorized by the FDA:\n\nNo symptoms or adverse events noted. Patient is traveling in June of 2022 with her family. Her parents requested to get her first dose of the vaccine early since she is traveling. Ok”d per Dr. to give a couple of months early. (VAERS ID 2281214)\n\nCases where the new vaccines were given to the babies and toddlers under the age of 5 after the FDA authorization and there was an adverse reaction are just now starting to trickle in.\n\nIn one case, a 2-year-old baby girl started hallucinating within 6 hours of being injected:\n\nPatient developed sudden onset hallucinations (visual, possibly auditory) and psychosis beginning 6 hours after vaccination and lasting for 7 hours, then fell asleep. Reawakened with more hallucinations/psychosis 16 hours after vaccination (6 am today) lasting for another 1.5 hours. Transported to Pediatric ED where psychosis/hallucinations resolved. Examination normal. Remained at baseline (normal) upon discharge from ED. (VAERS ID 2329230)\n\nOne mother reported on Twitter that her 8-year-old daughter started hallucinating and having feelings of suicide after the shots.\n\nI never heard my 8 year old talk about suicide or have hallucinations or feeling of bugs crawling on her until we have the #safeandEffective vaccine. (Source.)\n\nEarly reports in VAERS show that the poor toddlers are putting up a good fight in trying to reject the shots, but sadly, they are over-matched and sometimes just end up getting jabbed twice for resisting.\n\nPatient moved during vaccination attempt and over half of COVID 19 vaccine was not injected intramuscularly. Patient returned on 6/23/22 to another mobile vaccine clinic to receive full dose appropriate for her age. (3 years old – VAERS ID 2329682) Vaccinator inserted needle into pt”s arm. Mother did not have a good hold and pt moved. Needle came out before vaccinator was able to inject. Pt was then vaccinated with full dose. (3 years old – VAERS ID 2327250) Nurse stuck needle in child”s arm to vaccinate, but child pulled arm away before vaccine was administered. Nurse wasted that dose and administered the vaccine in the opposite arm. (2 years old – VAERS ID 2326989) EUA – young moderna dose 1. Patient moved away during administration and only received a partial dose (majority of solution was not injected). Parent informed and clinical team. Patient was re-vaccinated per guidelines. (2 years old – VAERS ID 2328918) Needle inserted into patients L thigh, but vaccine was not administered. Patient slapped the syringe and the needle bent. RN was able to remove entire needle. Small scratch noted on L thigh. (2 years old – VAERS ID 2325671)\n\nSteve Kirsch reported that nurses told him that many of these children 2 and 3 years old are having seizures.\n\nI’m getting multiple reports from my nurse friends about kids 2 and 3 years old having seizures. It is ONLY happening on vaccinated kids, and symptoms start 2 to 5 days after the COVID vaccine. Doctors are mystified by a rash of seizures, rashes, etc. happening to 2 and 3-year-old kids. The only thing these kids have in common is that they were given the COVID vaccine just days earlier (two to five days earlier). The doctors cannot figure out what is causing the seizures (since it couldn’t be the vaccine since those are safe and effective). The medical staff is not permitted to talk about the cases to the press or on social media or they will be fired. One nurse posted something to the effect of “how is this legal????” I had to paraphrase to protect the poster. This is why you are hearing these reports from me. They can’t fire me. There is nothing on the mainstream media about this since the nurses and doctors aren’t allowed to talk about it. This will all come out some day, but for now, everyone is keeping quiet about it and the doctors are instructed to convince the parents that it isn’t vaccine related and that they are the only ones having the problem. Because that’s how science works. (Source.)\n\nMeanwhile, state legislators and the U.S. Congress are overwhelmingly passing laws to criminalize anyone who denies that millions of Jews were killed in the Holocaust during WW II, but if you deny the fact that millions of children and adults are being killed and harmed by COVID-19 shots, you can have your own corporate news show and earn tons of money from Big Pharma ads, or you can be given a job working at the FDA or CDC.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nIs there any more doubt that the COVID-19 plandemic, which was used to transfer America’s wealth to Big Pharma with literally TRILLIONS of taxpayer funds transferred into their accounts, has now allowed Pfizer to have complete control of the country by buying the White House and President of the United States?\n\nIt began with fellow billionaire Donald Trump, of course, in 2020 who strong-armed the FDA into giving fast-track emergency use authorization to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. (This is from our Bitchute channel.)\n\nThen Biden was installed as President and kept the coffers full, and now that 80% of Americans have already received a COVID-19 vaccine and demand is waning, with 98 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine currently sitting unused due to lack of demand, the call was put in to Joe this week to keep the faucet running, and the White House obliged and pledged another $9 BILLION for 300 million more doses of the deadly COVID-19 shots.\n\nTrump and Biden might disagree on a lot of things, but Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines ain’t one of them. (This is also on our Bitchute channel.)\n\nThe top three firms who hold the most stock in Pfizer are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street (source), and there probably are very few investment firms who do NOT own some Pfizer stock, so when you see officials with the FDA, CDC, and others promoting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, they are probably all shareholders and cashing in, as are most members of Congress (unfortunately, these records at opensecrets.org only go through 2018; it would be interesting to see from 2020 and later.)\n\nOf course we’ve known for a long time that Pfizer owns most of the corporate media:\n\nAnd they are the largest criminal organization in the world, based on settled criminal cases with the Department of Justice.\n\nDrug Cartel: Biden Admin agrees to pay Pfizer 56% more for their COVID shot\n\nThe pharma giant is already shattering profit records, and is expected to generate well over $100 billion in 2022 revenue.\n\nby Jordan Schachtel\n\nThe Dossier\n\nPfizer is already swimming in record profits, but that hasn’t stopped the drug company from gouging the American taxpayer for every last dollar.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Biden Administration signed off on a new vaccine supply deal with Pfizer for $3.2 billion for 105 million COVID injections, but that’s only for the first batch of mRNA shots. The contract will generate well over $9 billion for Pfizer, as this latest purchase agreement tops off at 300 million doses. Compared to previous settlements with Pfizer, this public-private no-bid arrangement will come at a much higher cost to the U.S. taxpayer.\n\nThe Biden Administration has justified the deal by claiming that it needs to restock supply to prepare for seasonal spikes. The data does not support such a claim. According to the CDC, almost 100 million taxpayer-funded Pfizer shots (and 169 million total shots) have gone unused, resulting in billions of dollars in waste.\n\nAccording to CDC data there are currently over 168 million unused doses of the vaccines.\n\n– 59M unused Moderna shots\n\n– 98M unused Pfizer shots\n\n– 12M unused Janssen shots 762 million shots distributed and 594 shots administered. That 50,751 unused shots for every 100K US citizens pic.twitter.com/LFdN2RimoH — Justin Hart (@justin_hart) June 30, 2022\n\nThe new arrangement allows for the Biden Administration to buy Pfizer’s authorization-pending COVID injections, which the company claims is reformulated for newer variants.\n\nHowever, even the new formulation is already outdated. It was designed and trialed for an Omicron subvariant (BA.1) that was popular last Winter, but no longer exists in circulation, potentially rendering it just as useless as the Wuhan strain shot. The deal includes the infant and toddler formulations, which are based on the non-existent Wuhan strain.\n\nNone of the shots for this deal will be supplied under an FDA approved label. Instead, they will be distributed under emergency use authorization (EUA). Pfizer has never deployed its FDA-approved vaccine in the United States. The company recently acknowledged that it never intends on producing its original FDA approved vaccines.\n\nThe original deal with Pfizer was negotiated by the Trump Administration during the days of Operation Warpspeed. It paid the pharma giant $19.50 a dose. The new pact gives Pfizer $30.48 per dose, resulting in an astronomical 56% hike from the deal negotiated by the last administration.\n\nThe price hike conflicts with the probability that Pfizer’s costs are likely much lower than they were with the original purchase order. The infant and child shots have a fraction of the active agreement as the adult supply, and each vial stores more doses . Moreover, Pfizer has added an ingredient to the formula that allows for a significant shelf life extension, making the logistics much more cost effective.\n\nPfizer’s margins were already through the roof prior to the Wednesday announcement.\n\nPfizer’s May earnings report showed that the company logged a record breaking $26 billion in Q1 sales, marking a quarterly profit of $7.86 billion. Revenue was up 77% from 2021, while profit was up 61%. Now absorb these 2022 numbers in the context of Pfizer’s 2021 revenue outperforming its 2020 revenue by 95%.\n\nBefore the new vaccine purchase order, Pfizer was already on track to bring in over $100 billion in revenue and $32 billion in net income this year. In financial statements, the company has acknowledged that it has transformed itself into a COVID-19-driven business. All of its new income is coming from the American taxpayer and other government “customers” via their taxpayers, who have virtually no say in the matter.\n\nRead the full article at The Dossier.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe vaccine industry is committing suicide.\n\nIt was announced this week that the CDC has ordered 1.6 million doses of Bavarian Nordic’s smallpox and monkeypox vaccines to be injected into people during the second half of 2022, starting with 56,000 doses immediately, another 240,000 doses in the coming weeks, then another 750,000 doses over the rest of the summer with another 500,000 doses in the fall.\n\nWith the carnage that has just occurred for the past 18 months where 7,478,300 people were killed and 583,023,500 people were injured by experimental COVID shots in the U.S. and Europe, who in the world would fall for the lies of Big Pharma and their crony politicians again, and sign up to get these shots?\n\nCertainly not the anti-vaxxers, and certainly not those who were foolish enough to get the COVID shots, were injured by them, and then woke up to the fact that they were lied to and hence suffered tremendously.\n\nNo, these shots are obviously targeting those who survived the COVID shots, believed the shots somehow conferred benefit on them since they are still alive and breathing, and trust the medical tyrants to cure their fear of the fake monkeypox pandemic which has not even really started yet.\n\nMost of them are probably suffering some kind of skin infection that was probably produced as a side effect from the COVID shots, such as shingles, and they will be led to believe they have some dreaded new form of monkeypox that needs another vaccine.\n\nThis is vaccine marketing suicide, as they are killing off and crippling the vaccine cult members, and destroying their repeat business. Obviously reducing the world’s population is a worthy goal in their minds, so much so they are sacrificing the future of the vaccine business model by destroying their future customers.\n\nAmid monkeypox outbreak, US officials plan to release 1.6M doses of Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine\n\nby Eric Sagonowsky\n\nFiercePharma\n\nAs a monkeypox outbreak quietly gains steam in the U.S. and elsewhere, American health officials are laying out a plan to stop it. One major component is vaccinations. Tuesday, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed a plan to make available 1.6 million doses of Bavarian Nordic’s smallpox and monkeypox vaccine Jynneos by the end of the year, according to press reports. Of that total, officials will immediately make available 56,000 doses in areas of high transmission. They’ll follow that release with another 240,000 doses in the coming weeks, then with another 750,000 doses over the rest of the summer, USA Today reports. The officials plan to release another 500,000 doses in the fall, taking the total supply to around 1.6 million doses. The doses are intended for people with known exposures to the virus or those who are at high risk. At a briefing, CDC official Jennifer McQuiston said that intimate or sexual contact appears to be a “primary driver for transmission,” as quoted by USA Today. Officials say people should get vaccinated if they have had a sexual partner diagnosed with the illness. Men who have sex with men—and who have had multiple partners in areas of high transmission—should seek vaccination as well, officials said. Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos vaccine has been in high demand for more than a month since monkeypox cases started cropping up in Europe and North America. In the U.S., the vaccine won approval in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox in people determined to be at high risk. Outside of the U.S., Bavarian Nordic in mid-May inked a vaccine order with an unnamed European country. After that order, the company has twice lifted its 2022 revenue forecast after more orders came in. Also on Tuesday, CDC officials said they’re starting up a Emergency Operations Center to respond to the monkeypox outbreak. The center will be staffed by 300 people.\n\nRead the full article at FiercePharma.\n\nRelated:\n\nSee Also:"

        "Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nMore evidence that the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs were specifically designed to reduce the world’s population to fit the “Green Agenda” that the earth can no longer support current population levels continues to be reported, as now statistics show declining birthrates worldwide following the COVID-19 vaccine roll outs in 2021.\n\nAs we have recently reported, the COVID-19 vaccines cause a higher percentage of miscarriages than even the abortion pills.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see how evil and criminal our health officials in government, such as CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, have become when they go on TV and blatantly lie to the American people about the safety and efficacy of these killer COVID vaccines. The pharma-funded corporate media is also complicit with mass murder and criminal intent to harm.\n\nThis is a worldwide catastrophe unfolding right before our eyes, as labor shortages are already crippling our economy due to how many people have died and been crippled by the vaccines, and now we see that there is little hope of replenishing the work force anytime soon, as birth rates rapidly decline and young, child-bearing adults become infertile.\n\nWe truly live in evil times!\n\nIf there is any small consolation in all of this, it is the fact that the “anti-vaccine” people who still have their minds and souls in tact because they did not bow down and submit to these evil demonic tyrants, will be the ones who are still fertile and reproducing human life in the future.\n\nThe pro-Darwinian motto of “survival of the fittest” is going to take on a whole new meaning in the years ahead, if God does not completely destroy the planet first and start over with the promised Messianic New World Order.\n\nCovid Vaccines and Infertility\n\nWhy are birth rates plummeting in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Taiwan — nine months after mass covid vaccinations?\n\nby KanekoaTheGreat\n\nGermany\n\nGermany reported a 13% decline in births between January and March 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom reported a 7.7% decline in births with 75,670 births between January and February 2022 compared to 82,042 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, birth rates have also plummeted since the introduction of the covid vaccines.\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaiwan reported a 23.2% decline in births in May 2022 compared to the same month in 2021.\n\nIgor Chudov, the author of a popular covid newsletter wrote, “When expressed in “sigmas”, units of standard deviation, the 23.24% drop in the birth rate in Taiwan is a 26-sigma event! This is can be described as “unimaginable” in terms of the likelihood of happening due to random chance.”\n\nSweden\n\nSweden, without lockdown and school closures, reported a 6.6% decline with 35,454 births between January and April 2022 compared to 37,950 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nThe decline in birth rates is 6.9% for that same time period when compared to the average of 2019-2021.\n\nNetherlands\n\nNetherlands reported a 6.3% decline with 53,090 births between January and April 2022 compared to 56,671 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, data from around the world shows a substantial monthly decrease in birth rates from January 2022 to April 2022 compared to previous years.\n\nBiodistribution studies show that Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine lipid nanoparticles do end up in the ovaries and testes and subsequent studies have shown that covid-19 and covid vaccines lower sperm counts.\n\nFurthermore, the rate of fertility problems reported on the CDC’s VAERS database for the covid vaccines are astronomical.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the mRNA vaccines, there were about 1,500 reports of fertility problems over the 31-year history of VAERS for all vaccines combined.\n\nThere are 15,000 reports of fertility issues from the covid vaccine alone, which accounts for 95% of all the fertility issues in the history of VAERS.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are more than 30,000 reports of menstrual changes after covid vaccinations.\n\nWhy are birth rates plummeting in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Taiwan — nine months after the beginning of covid mass vaccinations?\n\nChildren are statistically at-or-near zero risk of being hospitalized or dying from covid-19.\n\nThe mass vaccination of children must stop now.\n\nRead the full article at Kanekoa’s Newsletter.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nNow that all age groups for children starting with babies 6 months old have been approved to be injected with the deadly COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC announced last week that they also want to start injecting children with a monkeypox vaccine. Time reports:\n\nU.S. health officials are looking to expand use of the monkeypox vaccine for children as the outbreak continues to spread across the U.S. and in countries around the world, with more than 3,300 cases reported globally. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing a protocol aimed at allowing use of Bavarian Nordic A/S’s Jynneos vaccine in children, if needed, according to documents prepared for a meeting of agency advisers that took place this week. The vaccine is currently cleared for use in adults and is considered safer than Emergent BioSolutions Inc.’s ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine, which can also be used against monkeypox. (Source.)\n\nThese are untested vaccines, and the rate of heart disease as a side effect, such as myocarditis, is even higher than the COVID-19 experimental vaccines.\n\nHere is what the CDC currently states regarding the rate of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination:\n\nOver 350 million mRNA vaccines were given during the study period and CDC scientists found that rates of myocarditis were highest following the second dose of an mRNA vaccine among males in the following age groups: 12–15 years (70.7 cases per one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech)\n\n16–17 years (105.9 cases per one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech)\n\n18–24 years (52.4 cases and 56.3 cases per million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, respectively) Source.\n\nOf course, the CDC is lying, and we have shown this using their own data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) which reveals much higher rates of heart disease among young people than they are claiming.\n\nThe two current vaccines approved for smallpox/monkeypox, however, have even higher rates of myocarditis.\n\nThe CDC admits that the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine has a rate of 5.7 cases of myocarditis per 1,000 doses administered.\n\nThat’s 5,700 cases of myocarditis per one million doses!\n\nThe monkeypox vaccine they want to inject into children, Jynneos, according to the CDC’s Dr. Brent Petersen, has zero cases of myocarditis.\n\nBut according to Dr. Meryl Nass, he is lying (is anyone surprised?) Dr. Nass pulled the 200 page FDA licensure review of the Jynneos smallpox-monkeypox vaccine which documents two studies:\n\nI discovered that 2 studies of Jynneos found that 11% in one and and 18% of recipients in the other had developed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (troponin). This implies heart muscle damage of some kind. It was not studied further, and the reviewers admitted they did not know whether myocarditis was caused by the Jynneos vaccine, or not. And that they would need to perform future surveillance to find out. I wonder why Dr. Petersen, one of CDC’s monkeypox leads, brazenly lied to the committee about this? Was he so instructed? Or was he incompetent and ignorant? We can probably assume that CDC’s employees know on which side their bread is buttered. Since CDC has made the decision that Jynneos is to be used against monkeypox, despite its apparently awful risk-benefit ratio (see my monkeypox article) I imagine all its employees will be sticking to this story. (Source.)\n\nJust taking the lower of the two numbers, 11%, would produce 110,000 cases of heart disease per one million doses!\n\nWe are well into the Globalists’ population control by means of vaccines now, and America’s children are in extreme danger from ignorant parents who still believe in vaccines.\n\nHere are the full notes from Dr. Nass of the CDC ACIP meeting this past week discussing monkeypox vaccines and drugs.\n\nACIP discussed Monkeypox drugs and vaccines at yesterday’s ACIP meeting, and were lied to about both by CDC briefer. Here is the truth.\n\n3 Drugs that might be used for monkey pox\n\n1. Brincidofovir. Brincidofovir is licensed (since 1996) for treatment of smallpox but is not available in the US stockpile (termed the National Strategic Stockpile) and CDC is considering obtaining an expanded access IND (a legal permission from FDA to test/use it in people) so that it could legally be used if needed. But it could be used off-label, since it is licensed. Why is CDC jumping through unnecessary hoops? Probably in order to control the supply, in a similar though not identical manner to what FDA did with donated hydroxychloroquine.\n\n2. TPOXX, the controversial drug made by SIGA Technologies. When the Obama administration first tried to buy this drug, Congress had a fit and the media helped blow up the deal. From David Willman, writing for the LA Times in 2011:\n\nOver the last year, the Obama administration has aggressively pushed a $433-million plan to buy an experimental smallpox drug, despite uncertainty over whether it is needed or will work. Senior officials have taken unusual steps to secure the contract for New York-based Siga Technologies Inc., whose controlling shareholder is billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, one of the world’s richest men and a longtime Democratic Party donor. When Siga complained that contracting specialists at the Department of Health and Human Services were resisting the company’s financial demands, senior officials replaced the government’s lead negotiator for the deal, interviews and documents show. When Siga was in danger of losing its grip on the contract a year ago, the officials blocked other firms from competing… Negotiations over the price of the drug and Siga’s profit margin were contentious. In an internal memo in March, Dr. Richard J. Hatchett, chief medical officer for HHS’ biodefense preparedness unit, said Siga’s projected profit at that point was 180%, which he called “outrageous.”\n\nSo the Obama administration simply waited out the media storm, and bought the drug for $30 million more in 2013. Here is what the NYT said about it in 2013, when the purchase was finalized:\n\nThe United States government is buying enough of a new smallpox medicine to treat two million people in the event of a bioterrorism attack, and took delivery of the first shipment of it last week. But the purchase has set off a debate about the lucrative contract, with some experts saying the government is buying too much of the drug at too high a price. A small company, Siga Technologies, developed the drug in recent years. Whether the $463 million order is a boondoggle or bargain depends on which expert is talking… Dr. Henderson and Dr. Philip Russell, who formerly headed the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and served on the advisory panel with him, said they expected the government to pay much less for an antiviral drug since they cost little to make and the alternative, vaccines, cost the government $3 a dose. “If they’re talking $250 a course, they’re a bunch of thieves,” Dr. Russell said.\n\nAsked how much TPOXX (Tecovirimat) and 3. Vaccinia Immune Globulin there is in the stockpile, the CDC’s Dr. Petersen would not answer, only saying there was enough. He didn’t know that I recalled the NY Times had spilled the beans on the initial purchase of 2 million courses. How much have they bought since? Presumably someone decided it would not be in the governments’ best interest for the public to know how much of these unproven products were purchased from a top Dem donor.\n\nIn 2018, FDA gave the drug a license. The NYT explained how this happened:\n\nThe antiviral pill, tecovirimat, also known as Tpoxx, has never been tested in humans with smallpox because the disease was declared eradicated in 1980, three years after the last known case. But it was very effective at protecting animals deliberately infected with monkeypox and rabbitpox, two related diseases that can be lethal. It also caused no severe side effects when safety-tested in 359 healthy human volunteers, the F.D.A. said… The F.D.A. approval of the drug went to Siga Technologies of Corvallis, Ore., a private company that developed the medicine under a federal biomedical defense contract… Research on tecovirimat — originally designated ST-246 — began at the institute (NIAID) after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Dr. Fauci said.\n\nSo the taxpayer paid to develop it, and paid through the nose to buy it, Fauci-style, no doubt paying royalties back to the NIAID.\n\nIs there a public health emergency?\n\nDr. Maldonado asked about the possible designation of a public health emergency of International Concern by WHO, and how this would impact CDC.\n\nYes, WHO had a meeting to discuss this today, said Dr. Petersen, and CDC participated but he does not know what the result was. EUAs could eventuate if there are emergency declarations.\n\nDr. Maldonado further noted that the presentation (the severity and overall clinical picture) of monkeypox is unexpected for orthopox viruses… and then asks what to do about children. There have been NO child cases internationally (excluding Africa?—Nass) said Dr. Rao. She says cases in Nigeria have been strange too, but I was confused about whether they were equivalent to those in the west or more like historical cases. Dr. Petersen agreed. Melinda Wharton (the new exec secretary of the ACIP as well as having been a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee) says that recommended PPE for monkeypox includes gloves and respirator, and was not sure if medical providers would be considered at risk after seeing a patient, particularly if they used no respirator.\n\nDr. Rao says she will need to get back to the committee on this; the risk exposure assessment is being revised, it seems, by CDC.\n\nDr. Fryhofer asked about expected adverse events of the proposed drugs. Cidofovir has renal toxicity and is used with cimetidine in an effort to prevent that. Brincidofovir has liver and GI toxicity.\n\nTPOXX is “quite safe and well tolerated” says Dr. Petersen.\n\nHowever, it was only tested in 359 people in a phase 3 trial, according to the label. At least one experienced EKG (cardiac) changes, and at least one had a drop in their blood count. Another had palpable purpura, which can be quite serious, usually the result of autoimmune vasculitis. Facial swelling suggests anaphylaxis. That is a rate of more than 1% experiencing serious adverse events after only taking the drug for 14 days or less. This was the first lie I caught him on.\n\nRegarding how monkeypox spreads, Dr. Rao says “the cases we are aware of are due to skin contact or towels, bedding”. 99% of cases recently were attributed to gay males, I read elsewhere. Dr. Long persists with her original question, asking whether the general US population should be worried about normal casual contacts, like going to the grocery store? Dr. Rao hedges, saying that Americans don’t need to worry about this, and at first said it seems to require “pretty intimate contact.” But then she qualified it, noting, “The risk to the general public at this time is still very low.”\n\nDr. Rao is asked to comment on a CDC statement that the virus is transmitted through respiratory secretions. She says it is due to saliva, respiratory droplets, implying no airborne spread.\n\nDr. Sanchez asks how severe the disease actually is. The briefer said hospitalizations have been for pain control, like proctitis. 197 courses of TPOXX have been distributed and 8 cases have received the drug…but none have gotten it iv, so I am again confused by the answer. I think what was meant is that no one has received immune globulin (an iv drug) yet. Dr. Petersen admits cases have been mild.\n\nDr. Grace Lee says she was exhausted, they have been meeting so much to provide info to the public, and it is time to adjourn.\n\n__________________\n\nMy computer saves the day\n\nI am so glad my computer started broadcasting the end of the ACIP meeting when I finally got to my destination—as soon as it connected to wifi and before I had even plugged it in, it began talking to me. I heard the second part of Dr. Brent Petersen’s presentation, and the questions, described above.\n\nWhy am I glad? Because I caught Dr. Petersen lying to the ACIP. Twice. He claimed that there were 5.7. cases of myocarditis per 1,000 recipients due to ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine [true], but none from Jynneos.\n\nThis reminded me that before I began live-blogging some of the meetings, years ago, I had discovered from reading the abbreviated ACIP meeting minutes [who knows how accurate they are?] that the CDC briefers were lying to the ACIP about anthrax vaccine. It seems they leave nothing to chance in order to get their desired vaccine approvals.\n\nIf you read my post on Monkeypox published June 22, you would know that I looked over the 200 page FDA licensure review of the Jynneos smallpox-monkeypox vaccine. That is where I discovered that 2 studies of Jynneos found that 11% in one and 18% of recipients in the other had developed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (troponin). This implies heart muscle damage of some kind. It was not studied further, and the reviewers admitted they did not know whether myocarditis was caused by the Jynneos vaccine, or not. And that they would need to perform future surveillance to find out.\n\nI wonder why Dr. Petersen, one of CDC’s monkeypox leads, brazenly lied to the committee about this? Was he so instructed? Or was he incompetent and ignorant? We can probably assume that CDC’s employees know on which side their bread is buttered. Since CDC has made the decision that Jynneos is to be used against monkeypox, despite its apparently awful risk-benefit ratio (see my monkeypox article) I imagine all its employees will be sticking to this story.\n\n__________________\n\nHere is what the Jynneos label (aka package insert, the legal document explaining the studies that led to licensure) has to say. 1.3% of recipients had a cardiac adverse event of special interest, and 2.1% if they had previously been vaccinated for smallpox. That seems pretty serious, and it seems like a very high rate: 1 in 75. From the label:\n\nCardiac AESIs were reported to occur in 1.3% (95/7,093) of JYNNEOS recipients and 0.2% (3/1,206)\n\nof placebo recipients who were smallpox vaccine-naïve. Cardiac AESIs were reported to occur in\n\n2.1% (16/766) of JYNNEOS recipients who were smallpox vaccine-experienced. The higher\n\nproportion of JYNNEOS recipients who experienced cardiac AESIs was driven by 28 cases of\n\nasymptomatic post-vaccination elevation of troponin-I in two studies: Study 5, which enrolled\n\n482 HIV-infected subjects and 97 healthy subjects, and Study 6, which enrolled 350 subjects with\n\natopic dermatitis and 282 healthy subjects. An additional 127 cases of asymptomatic post-vaccination\n\nelevation of troponin-I above the upper limit of normal but not above 2 times the upper limit of normal\n\nwere documented in JYNNEOS recipients throughout the clinical development program, 124 of which\n\noccurred in Study 5 and Study 6. Proportions of subjects with troponin-I elevations were similar\n\nbetween healthy and HIV-infected subjects in Study 5 and between healthy and atopic dermatitis\n\nsubjects in Study 6. A different troponin assay was used in these two studies compared to the other\n\nstudies, and these two studies had no placebo controls. The clinical significance of these\n\nasymptomatic post-vaccination elevations of troponin-I is unknown.\n\nAmong the cardiac AESIs reported, 6 cases (0.08%) were considered to be causally related to\n\nJYNNEOS vaccination and included tachycardia, electrocardiogram T wave inversion,\n\nelectrocardiogram abnormal, electrocardiogram ST segment elevation, electrocardiogram T wave\n\nabnormal, and palpitations.\n\nNone of the cardiac AESIs considered causally related to study vaccination were considered serious.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 45,752 deaths and 4,522,307 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines, while the United States’ vaccine adverse events recording system (VAERS) is now reporting 29,031 deaths and 1,307,928 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nWe know that as huge as these numbers are which are official government statistics, that they only represent a very small fraction of the total number of deaths and injuries suffered by those who chose to receive COVID-19 vaccines during the past 18 months.\n\nLast year, Dr. Jessica Rose did a comprehensive analysis to determine the “under-reported factor” in VAERS, and came up with 41X, meaning that the recorded data for adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in VAERS had to be multiplied by 41 to get more accurate numbers. See:\n\nHowever, now that more time has elapsed since this study was performed, many feel that 41X is significantly too low, and should be closer to 100X, which is the number that was previously used based on a 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nEarlier this week Albert Benavides, who downloads the VAERS data each week and reports on it, contacted me and informed me that VAERS was deleting many records of COVID-19 vaccines, and that this has been going on for 10 weeks now. He had found over 20,000 records purged from VAERS.\n\nWhile these government health agencies are required by law to publish these adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, it is clear they are trying to hide these numbers from the public. All of it is available to the public, but not a single corporate news outlet has ever reported on this data, only the Alternative Media.\n\nSo if we take the publicly available data from VAERS and the European EMA and multiply by 100, these would be the true numbers of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines: 7,478,300 deaths and 583,023,500 injuries in Europe and the U.S.\n\nIs there any evidence available to corroborate these kinds of numbers of people who died and were injured from the COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nOh yes, there most certainly is!\n\nFormer Blackrock Fund Manager Edward Dowd was one of the first to sound the alarm about the massive increase in payouts for life insurance and health insurance benefits in February of this year (2022), as insurance companies began reporting on their earnings from 2021, the year the COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out. Here is an interview he did with Kristi Leigh.\n\nAnd here is a more recent interview from earlier this month (June, 2022) with the New American.\n\nWe also published an article about a week ago from Margaret Menge reporting that a 163% increase in death benefits was paid out for group life insurance policies by the 5th largest life insurance company in the U.S. in 2021.\n\nThis is creating tremendous shortages of human resources in the economy as the entire financial system is heading towards a collapse.\n\nAnd yet almost nobody in the media, not even much in the Alternative Media, is addressing the fact that this labor shortage is due to massive deaths and injuries from the COVID vaccines.\n\nWhile most of the food I consume comes from my own company, I still go to town from time to time and visit a local grocery store to stock up on certain items, and for the past few weeks, it has been extremely difficult to check out, because the store has had a very difficult time keeping people employed, and many of their employees are frequently sick.\n\nYesterday I was waiting to check out, and the manager of the store came up front to help with the long checkout lines. It used to be that when I shopped at this particular store, that the standard way the checkout people started the checkout, was to ask me: “Did you find everything you were looking for?”\n\nThey don’t ask this question anymore. In fact, there was a particular product I used to stock up on that I had not seen in my past two trips to the store, and I mentioned it to the manager who was checking me out, and he said: “We don’t even know anymore why some things are out of stock, and we have no idea when they might be restocked.”\n\nThis situation is not going to get better anytime soon, that’s for sure. Where will the future labor be found, when the COVID-19 vaccines have a better success rate in causing miscarriages than the abortion pill (see: 82% Pregnant Women Getting COVID Vaccine have Miscarriages – More than the Abortion Pill), and now a study has shown that men are becoming infertile as well after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSeldom now does a day go by where I do not hear someone in my circle of friends and family report that someone they know has now died “suddenly.”\n\nWhen will the masses wake up to the fact that their governments and Big Pharma have an agenda, a very evil agenda, to reduce the world’s population which is now a year and half old?\n\nAnd when they finally do wake up, will it be too late? Will they be sitting in a FEMA camp somewhere hoping that the government is going to give them enough food to stay alive?\n\n45,752 deaths and 4,522,307 injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 45,752 fatalities, and 4,522,307 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,050,686) are serious injuries.\n\n“Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started publishing this, others from Europe have also calculated the numbers and confirmed the totals.*\n\nHere is the summary data through June 18, 2022.\n\nTotal reactions for the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran

Our much-loved friend and colleague Harry Gration very suddenly died today.”\n\nGration had for the largest part of his career presented BBC Yorkshire’s Look North news programme but worked elsewhere in the country and on sports programme Grandstand during his 40-year career with the broadcaster.\n\nHe joined the BBC in 1978 and Look North in 1982. He presented his last show in 2020, retiring the day before his 70th birthday. He said at the time he had “always lived the story.”\n\nDuring his career, Gration won two Royal Television Society (RTS) awards for sports documentaries and he won the RTS Best Presenter award twice. He was made a Member of the British Empire in 2013 for services to broadcasting.\n\nBBC Director-General Tim Davie said: “Harry Gration MBE was an outstanding broadcaster and commentator.\n\n“He had a real connection with the public who saw him as one of their own.\n\n“Loved everywhere, but especially in Yorkshire, he will be hugely missed by his many fans and friends. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.”\n\nHelp LAPD Bryan’s surviving family for future\n\n‘Kind and selfless’ husband and dad dies suddenly at work aged 38\n\nBy Shannen Headley\n\nleicestermercury.co.uk\n\nFamily and friends have paid tribute to a “loving, kind and selfless” husband and father, who has died at the age of 38. Christopher Houghton-Rai passed away “suddenly” while at work on Tuesday, June 21.\n\nThe Loughborough resident, who was a parts department manager at Toyota Vertu, collapsed unexpectedly while at work. His wife, Raj Houghton-Rai, said an air ambulance was despatched to the scene at Belton Road but after 90 minutes of “exhausting every measure” paramedics were unable to save her “soulmate”.\n\nWhile the details surrounding the father-of-one’s death are still unclear, his loved ones said they are still in a state of shock and have not yet come to terms with the tragic news. Raj said: “I’m feeling utter disbelief, shock, devastation, pain and panic.”\n\n“When I got there they explained what had happened and it was agreed that nothing else was to be done. I got the chance to speak to him as they turned off the equipment and I begged him to come back to us and told him that we loved him beyond words.\n\n“His colleagues were amazing.

But the Lakeland grocery company says it will not offer the vaccine approved for children ages 4 and under “at this time.” Spokesperson Hannah Herring said Tuesday that Publix will not release a statement explaining its decision. (Full article.)\n\nApparently Publix is not the only retail outlet in Florida refusing to inject babies with the toxic COVID shots.\n\nBrianna Andrews, writing in Jacksonville for News4Jax, reports:\n\nChildren under 5 years old are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, but some local parents say they are struggling to find appointments to get them. News4JAX reached out to multiple local pharmacies and hospitals, and most places didn’t carry the vaccine for young children. It’s still possible to get an appointment, but parents really need to plan ahead. News4JAX called a dozen local pharmacies in the area, and none of them offered the vaccine for children under 5. They told us they did not intend to. The only place that we found that offers local appointments is CVS.

Publix refused to explain their decision, suggesting that this is a legal can of worms.\n\nHospitals are apparently the only ones injecting the babies. Is it because they have Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) to handle the casualties, while retail outlets do not?\n\nIf you Want to Sacrifice Your Baby to the Vaccine Gods, Go to a Hospital\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

Three days later, she was referred to our clinic. She had the best corrected visual acuity of 5/20 on the snellen chart in both eyes. Conjunctiva of both eyes were hyperemic, corneal epithelial edema and keratic prepitates were observed in the lower quadrant. There was intense reaction in the anterior chamber and posterior synechia in the right eye. Intraocular pressure values were 60 mmHg in the right and 55 mmHg in the left with the Goldman applanation tonometer. Corneal edema was attributed to high intraocular pressure. The patient was hospitalized and necessary blood tests were taken.

(Source.)\n\nThat’s an average of 992 cases of eye disorders reported each month following COVID-19 vaccine injections, and this is most certainly NOT an exhaustive list of eye disorders.\n\nBut it does give us a sub-set of data to compare to all other FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years (360 months) prior to the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nUsing this exact same set of eye disorders, we find 11,898 cases filed for eye disorders over the course of 30 years following all other FDA-approved vaccines, which averages out to 33 cases a month.

        "URGENT: The Covid vaccine paper on declining sperm counts is even worse than it seems at first\n\nby Alex Berenson\n\nUnreported Truths\n\nOn Friday, the journal Andrology published a peer-reviewed paper showing large decreases in sperm counts among men after the second dose of Pfizer’s mRNA Covid jab.\n\nBased on counts from men who donated sperm to three fertility clinics in Israel, this finding is devastating – medically and politically.\n\nIt cuts to the heart of the hottest button question of all about the mRNA shots, whether they have hidden fertility risks. That issue has simmered since early 2021, following my reporting that data showed the shots had caused excess miscarriages in rats – and other reports showing that measurable amounts of vaccine reached the ovaries and testes in tests in rats.\n\nEver since, media “fact-checkers” and public health authorities have dismissed and mocked the concerns and anyone who raises them:\n\n—\n\nNow – after a half-billion men have received mRNA shots – the skeptics appear to be right. Again. The Israeli paper offers hard evidence that the vaccines may present a systemic risk to men’s sperm counts. What was a conspiracy theory is now just a theory. AGAIN.\n\nThe paper raises questions about mechanism of action that must be answered immediately. And on top of the myocarditis risk, the finding is more evidence that encouraging – much less forcing – men under 40 to take the mRNA vaccines was a catastrophic mistake.\n\n—\n\nHowever, the authors qualified their findings by reporting that after five months, sperm levels recovered. Thus the decreases were only temporary, they wrote.\n\nPut aside the fact that a five-month decrease hardly qualifies as temporary for someone trying to start a family – or compared to a “vaccine” that loses effectiveness against Omicron within weeks or months.\n\nAs other writers have pointed out, the actual data in the paper do not really support the argument that sperm levels returned to normal after five months. In fact, by some measures, levels continued to decline.\n\nRather than acknowledging this fact, the authors offered the best possible spin on their data, while at the same time publishing the figures themselves near the end of the paper so that other researchers could see the reality for themselves.\n\nThis tactic is now commonplace among researchers putting out data that might raise concerns about the mRNA shots. It is likely a response to the overwhelming political pressure to hide the deepening crisis around the safety and efficacy of shots that governments have given to over a billion people worldwide.\n\nBelow is the crucial chart, which shows that “total motile count” – the number of sperm in the ejaculated semen – plunged 22 percent three to five months after the second shot (T2) and barely recovered during the final count (T3), when it was still 19 percent below the pre-shot level.\n\nSOURCE\n\nEven more importantly, the fall in sperm counts CANNOT be blamed on short- or even medium-term inflammation as mRNA-generated spike proteins causes our immune cells to ramp up the systemic production of anti-spike antibodies. If that were the case, one would expect to see a short term decrease in sperm count that reverses over time. Instead, total sperm counts are unaffected shortly after the mRNA shots, then decrease months later and hardly recover.\n\nTo play down this unpleasant reality, the researchers instead focused on the fact that median rather than average counts did recover after five months. (The median is the numerical midpoint of a series; If a series goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, the median will be 3, but the average will be 30 divided by 5, or 6.)\n\nBoth the median and the average can be valuable statistics. Using the median rather than the average will hide extreme outliers. In this case, the fact that the average fell much more than the median is a sign that some of the men probably had near-zero sperm counts in both the second and third time periods – and that fact is arguably more important than the median change.\n\nAll of which is to say that this data cannot be easily explained away and should not be ignored, as badly as the media would like to do so. The fall in sperm counts is part of an emerging and increasingly dark picture about the long-term health impacts of the mRNA shots – and should all by itself convince parents not to risk exposing their children to these powerful biotechnologies.\n\nRead the full article at Unreported Truths.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

When you take that cohort out, the rate of miscarriage was 82%, right in line with findings from the Pfizer documents.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper:\n\n“For a first-trimester woman to get this injection, they have more of a chance of having a miscarriage or stillbirth than if they were to actually take an abortifacient.”\n\nRelated:\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Jordan Schachtel\n\nThe Dossier\n\nIt appears that the United States just became the only country in the world to “vaccinate” babies and toddlers with COVID injections.\n\nDespite what you are reading in the press, the U.S. seems to be, as of Friday, the only country in the world to partake in experimental COVID therapeutics for infants.\n\nOn Friday, the FDA authorized mRNA COVID shots (both Pfizer and Moderna) under emergency use authorization for children under 5 years old, all the way down to 6 months of age. As you’ll see in a moment, this is unprecedented anywhere in the world.\n\nThe approval made its way through the halls of the federal bureaucracy, regardless of any studies showing a positive benefit for injecting young children with mRNA shots, which, even in adults, do not effectively prevent coronavirus infection.\n\nMaking matters worse, our deceitful corporate press is actively engaged in a cover up operation to make it seem like the new policy is not particularly unique, when in fact, it is exclusively unique.\n\nFDA advisors just voted 21-0 to authorize Moderna’s vaccine for children 6 months old to 5 years old. Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland all suspended Moderna for people under 30 due to safety concerns. But in the US we’ll now be giving this product to infants. — alex gutentag (@galexybrane) June 15, 2022\n\nMany corporate press reports, in hailing the announcement, churned out stenography today that made a quick mention of the fact that “a dozen countries, including China, already vaccinate kids under 5.”\n\nBut when you break down the data further, a true scandal arises.\n\nAs of a couple weeks ago there were only 7 countries where kids under 5 were given COVID injections, though the WHO now claims that number is 12.\n\nThe seven countries on record are:\n\n-Argentina\n\n-Bahrain\n\n-Chile\n\n-China\n\n-Cuba\n\n-UAE\n\n-Venezuela\n\n(the territory of Hong Kong, which uses the Chinese-made shots, is sometimes listed as the eighth country on record)\n\nBut that’s only the beginning of the madness.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba are the only countries that allow for COVID shots between the ages of two and three. The rest of the countries only go as young as three.\n\nMoreover, none of the nations are using mRNA. 5 out of 7 are using Chinese manufactured inactivated vaccines. Cuba and Venezuela are using the Cuban homebrew shot.\n\nAnd NONE of these countries are allowing for COVID shots between the ages of 6 months to two years, which means that the United States has become the only country in the world to allow for experimental COVID injections shots for babies and 2 year old toddlers.\n\nRead the full article at The Dossier\n\nSee Also:\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nAs expected, the FDA rubber stamped Pfizer’s and Moderna’s request to start injecting babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and through 4 years old with toxic and deadly COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.\n\nEighteen months after authorizing adults to use COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna on an emergency basis, the FDA has done the same for preschoolers who are at least 6 months old. The endorsement comes two days after an independent FDA advisory committee voted unanimously—though with some reservations about efficacy—to recommend the shots. All that remains before young kids start to receive the vaccines is for the CDC to sign off on the two jabs. Also on Friday, the FDA gave a green light to the Moderna vaccine for use in children aged 6 to 17. For several months, the only vaccine available in the United States for kids in this age group was Pfizer’s, as Moderna struggled to gain sanction because of concerns that it increased the risk of heart inflammation. (Source.)\n\nThe FDA is simply a branch of Big Pharma and this was just a formality, as the Biden Administration had already purchased 10 million doses for this age group weeks ago, and began distributing them to the states in preparation. See:\n\nWhat was unexpected, however, was that it was reported that Florida and the DeSantis Administration was the lone State to refuse to participate in this pre-purchase of 10 million doses from the Biden Administration.\n\nMcClatchyDC broke the story on Wednesday this week:\n\nEvery state has placed an order with the federal government to ensure coronavirus vaccines for young children are delivered as soon as regulators authorize their use — except for one. Florida missed a Tuesday deadline to request delivery of COVID-19 pediatric vaccines for children under 5, guaranteeing a delay in access for parents across the state, according to two U.S. government sources. All other 49 states placed pre-orders, which will be delivered in two tranches beginning as early as Monday to thousands of pediatricians’ offices, children’s hospitals, pharmacies and health centers across the country. Those facilities in Florida will not have access during this time and will remain without supply until Florida places an order. Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for the Florida Department of Health, confirmed the department “chose not to participate” in the vaccination program because the state health department is not following federal public health recommendations. “The Florida Department of Health has made it clear to the federal government that states do not need to be involved in the convoluted vaccine distribution process, especially when the federal government has a track record of developing inconsistent and unsustainable COVID-19 policies,” Redfern said. (Source.)\n\nWas the DeSantis Administration taking this position for political purposes, having seen how Donald Trump infuriated his voter base by continuing to promote the dangerous COVID-19 shots?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is escalating his feud with the White House over the COVID-19 response as he positions himself for a possible presidential campaign in 2024. DeSantis has been taking heat for his decision not to preorder from the federal government COVID-19 vaccines for infants and young kids. The White House initially made 10 million vaccines for young children available for states to preorder in anticipation that the shots will get the green light from federal regulators. Having a small stockpile of doses on hand will mean shots can start being administered shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorses their use. But Florida was the only state that decided not to place an order. During a press conference on Thursday, DeSantis said kids have “practically zero risk” of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 and that the state will not be devoting any resources to getting them vaccinated. “Doctors can get it. Hospitals can get it. But there’s not going to be any state programs that are going to be trying to get COVID jabs to infants and toddlers and newborns,” DeSantis said to applause from the crowd on hand. “That’s not where we’re gonna be utilizing our resources.” (Source.)\n\nThe Big Pharma drug pushers reacted in horror, with many doctors in Florida stating that they were not going to be able to order the vaccines if the State did not participate, and a Congressional Panel also took DeSantis to task.\n\nSome reports seem to indicate that Florida did reverse their decision, but apparently they simply clarified that doctors would be able to place orders through the federal system, but that the State Health Department would not be participating.\n\nA congressional panel established to oversee the federal government’s coronavirus response sent a letter to Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, on Friday, demanding an explanation of his decision not to order or distribute COVID-19 vaccines to children under 5 years old. The bipartisan House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is asking for a staff briefing from the DeSantis administration by June 30, unless the Florida governor reverses course. The DeSantis administration did so less than an hour after the letter was sent, at least partially, allowing Florida healthcare providers such as pediatricians and childrens’ hospitals to place orders through the federal system. State health facilities will still not be placing orders for vaccine doses, a Biden administration official said. (Source.)\n\nSo in the end, babies and toddlers in Florida can still be abused by their parents and doctors who choose to inject them with killer COVID-19 shots, but the DeSantis Administration will not endorse it.\n\nEven if this was simply a political decision, we applaud the Governor and his administration for taking this stance, one that no other Republican Governor has taken.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "BY\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nNow, data made available by the U.S. Government, but more specifically the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strongly suggests we’re not witnessing a monkeypox outbreak at all, but we’re instead witnessing a coverup of Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nAnd the vast majority of these reports have been a result of the mRNA Covid-19 injections by Moderna and Pfizer. The Janssen viral vector vaccine has had just 693 reports of herpes/shingles infections made against it. Whilst the Moderna vaccine has had 5,321, and the Pfizer jab a shocking 12,507.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMany would try to argue this increase is simply because so many Covid-19 injections have been administered. But anyone who argues this would be entirely wrong because official CDC data shows nearly 3 times as many Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 than Covid-19 injections administered as of June 3rd 2022.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020.\n\nBut according to ‘Our World in Data’, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs have been administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows –\n\nBased on official data available for 2008 to 2020, there were 0.6 adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered in the USA.\n\nBut based on official data available up to 3rd June 2022, there have been 30.7 adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered in the USA.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that the CDC have admitted they believe just 1 to 10% of adverse events are actually reported to VAERS, therefore the rates per 1 million doses could be significantly higher for both jabs.\n\nBut the available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization is set to meet on Thursday 23rd June 2022, to assess whether the alleged monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nBut it looks like they may actually be meeting to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the end of June 2022 over Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles.\n\nSee Also:"

        "Company cites “non-pandemic-related morbidity” and “unusual claims adjustments” in explanation of losses from group life insurance business: Stock falling, replaces CEO\n\nby Margaret Menge\n\nSubstack.com\n\nFive months after breaking the story of the CEO of One America insurance company saying deaths among working people ages 18-64 were up 40% in the third quarter of 2021, I can report that a much larger life insurance company, Lincoln National, reported a 163% increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021.\n\nThis is according to the annual statements filed with state insurance departments — statements that were provided exclusively to Crossroads Report in response to public records requests.\n\nThe reports show a more extreme situation than the 40% increase in deaths in the third quarter of 2021 that was cited in late December by One America CEO Scott Davison — an increase that he said was industry-wide and that he described at the time as “unheard of” and “huge, huge numbers” and the highest death rates that have ever been seen in the history of the life insurance business.\n\nThe annual statements for Lincoln National Life Insurance Company show that the company paid out in death benefits under group life insurance polices a little over $500 million in 2019, about $548 million in 2020, and a stunning $1.4 billion in 2021.\n\nFrom 2019, the last normal year before the pandemic, to 2020, the year of the Covid-19 virus, there was an increase in group death benefits paid out of only 9 percent. But group death benefits in 2021, the year the vaccine was introduced, increased almost 164 percent over 2020.\n\nHere are the precise numbers for Group Death Benefits taken from Lincoln National’s annual statements for the three years:\n\n2019: $500,888,808\n\n2020: $547,940,260\n\n2021: $1,445,350,949\n\nHere are the key numbers for 2021, below, shown on the company’s annual statement that was filed with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services. These are national numbers, not state-specific:\n\nLincoln National is the fifth-largest life insurance company in the United States, according to BankRate, after New York Life, Northwestern Mutual, MetLife and Prudential.\n\nThe company was founded in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1905, getting the OK from Abraham Lincoln’s son, Robert Todd Lincoln, to use his father’s name and likeness in its advertising.\n\nIt’s now based in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe annual statements filed with the states do not show the number of claims — only the total dollar amount of claims paid.\n\nGroup life insurance policies, in most cases, cover working-age adults ages 18-64 whose employer includes life insurance as an employee benefit.\n\nHow many deaths are represented by the 163% increase? It is not possible to determine by the dollar figures on the statements.\n\nBut the average death benefit for employer-provided group life insurance, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, is one year’s salary.\n\nIf the average annual salary of people covered by group life insurance policies in the United States is $70,000, this may represent 20,647 deaths of working adults, covered by just this one insurance company. This would represent at least 10,000 more deaths than in a normal year for just this one company.\n\nThe statements for the three years also show a sizable increase in ordinary death benefits — those not paid out under group policies, but under individual life insurance policies.\n\nIn 2019, the baseline year, that number was $3.7 billion. In 2020, the year of the Covid-19 pandemic, it went up to $4 billion, but in 2021, the year in which the vaccine was administered to almost 260 million Americans, it went up to $5.3 billion.\n\nThe statements show that the total amount that Lincoln National paid out for all direct claims and benefits in 2021 was more than $28 billion, $6 billion more than in 2020, when it paid out a total of $22 billion, which was less than the $23 billion it paid out in 2019, the baseline year.\n\nA $6 billion increase in expenses is something few companies could absorb, but Lincoln National has been working to do just that — by increasing sales of new insurance polices.\n\nIn the press release accompanying its annual report, and in its press release announcing the first quarter 2022 results — in which the company announces a $41 million loss in its Group Protection business — it trumpets an increase in sales. For first quarter 2022 that increase was 42 percent. The company also mentions that premiums have gone up 4 percent.\n\nInterestingly, in the press release accompanying the first-quarter 2022 results, Lincoln National attributes the $41 operating million loss to “non-pandemic-related morbidity” and “unusual claims adjustments.”\n\n“This change was driven by non-pandemic-related morbidity [emphasis added], including unusual claims adjustments [emphasis added], and less favorable returns within the company’s alternative investment portfolio.”\n\nMorbidity, of course, means disease. A lot of people are sick.\n\nThis matches what I was told by OneAmerica in January in emails following the publication of my story in The Center Square — that it was not only deaths of working-age people that shot up to unheard-of levels in 2021, but also short- and long-term disability claims.\n\nAnnual statements for other insurance companies are still being compiled and reviewed. So far, Lincoln National shows the sharpest increases in death benefits paid out in 2021, though Prudential and Northwestern Mutual also show significant increases — increases much larger in 2021 than in 2020, indicating that the cure was worse than the disease — much worse.\n\nLincoln National’s stock price fell from about $70 a share on January 3 to $50 a share this week, and last month, a new CEO was installed. It doesn’t appear to be a sudden change, but could have been timed to assuage major shareholders who have no idea what’s really happening and may think that a fresh face and fresh ideas can turn this around. Could I suggest instead an honest and thorough assessment of what’s really driving these stunning numbers?\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 “Vaccine” Casualties List\n\nSee Also:"

        "How are the globalists, who are desperate to reelect Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, attempting to stop the “red tidal wave” from sweeping over Michigan in November? They are deploying an array of dirty tricks to confuse and blunt the America First movement, using 1) the witches coven which occupies the state government, 2) RINOs in the State GOP, 3) the DeVos “never Trump” family (beyond RINOS), and 4) big money coming from the usual suspects, like Soros and Zuckerberg. As of mid-July, three weeks away from the August 2 Republican primary, 50 percent of Republicans are undecided in the governor’s race, thanks to a variety of chaos and psywar ops.\n\nHere's what the America First movement must do:\n\nUnify behind the proven, Trump-backed, and endorsed fighters, Matt DePerno for Attorney General and Kristina Karamo for Secretary of State. If we secure those positions, we have a fighting chance to protect the 2024 election. Ensure that Trump Republicans take the Michigan House and Senate. If you don’t know who they are, contact us. Don’t let the governor’s race be used to split the conservative movement. This is what the DeVos family is trying to do.\n\nAnd most importantly, outflank the bastards by transforming the Republican Party into the party of workers, producers, and patriots, as Donald Trump has pledged to do. LaRouchePAC’s new petition, “Hands Off Trump, Launch the Third America Revolution” is the clarion call for this fight.\n\nComing out of the August 2 primary, we must fully unify behind the GOP slate and ensure that we don’t let the globalist agenda lead to our self-defeat in November.\n\nOPERATION CHAOS\n\nGretchen Whitmer, her lesbian Attorney General, and her Soros-created Secretary of State will only be returned to office through the success of a many-front attack on the political process. We, and like-minded patriots, intend to stymie that attack.\n\nThe GOP governor’s race has been up-ended several times over. The two candidates leading in the polls were thrown off the ballot, due to petition problems, which were “uncovered” by Democratic Party investigations. One of the remaining GOP candidates was then arrested by the FBI in front of his young family, on the morning that the January 6 hearings began, on misdemeanor charges! The resulting publicity has shaken up the race. Another candidate received the backing of the DeVos family (Michigan’s version of the Cheneys—only richer), which opens the door to those who would create a civil war in the GOP and wreck its chances in November. No wonder half of Republican voters are still undecided\n\nOther pro-Trump candidates for Congress and State Legislature have been thrown off the ballot for petition irregularities and minor administrative infractions, in an effort to protect the RINO faction of the GOP. Somehow it was always the American First candidates who had petition problems.\n\nDespite a successful effort to recruit a full complement of Republican poll workers to serve at the infamous TCF Center (where the world watched the November 2020 election stolen), various regulations and rule-changes are already at play to again blunt Republican’s lawfully mandated election integrity efforts.\n\nIn some parts of the state, there are wide discrepancies between the number of Republican precinct delegates allocated to Trump supporters versus RINOs, due to obscure Republican party rules.\n\nThe Democratic Party, obviously with the backing of huge amounts of money, has just filed a citizens-initiative petition to amend the Michigan Constitution, which, if certified, will be on the ballot in November. If “Promote the Vote” stays on the ballot and passes, it will eliminate all effective voter identification, cripple election integrity efforts, and codify outside interference in the election (outside as in Zuckerberg and Soros, not the Russians). Patriots will have to devote a large amount of time and money to try to defeat it.\n\nObviously, this assault is not only going on in Michigan, and the enemy is so desperate it is exposing itself left and right (or left and left). Blatant actions by organizations connected to Mark Zuckerberg in Colorado and Democratic Party legal hitman Mark Elias in North Carolina show that the enemy knows what is at stake.\n\nThe solution: change the field of battle. While we must beat back these insane assaults, we must go on the offensive and shift the fighting to our terrain: namely the solution to the economic crisis. We must recruit broad forces to our economic agenda of abolishing the Federal Reserve and launching broad scale re-industrialization of our economy in manufacturing, energy, agriculture, transportation, and advanced technology. By unleashing the same spirit and productive forces that made Michigan the Arsenal of Democracy, we will bury the enemy’s radical cultural agenda with technological optimism. We will create a new Republican Party--a party of working people, other producers, and patriots--that will make Michigan great again and win statewide elections for years to come."

Départements with yellow (alert) status must reduce water usage for agricultural purposes by up to 50 percent (or simply prohibit withdrawals up to three days per week).'Yellow' level water restrictions do not only impact farmers -, with some water activities also being restricted.For those in orange départements, there are stronger limitations for watering gardens, green spaces, golf courses, and washing cars. In this scenario,At crisis (red) level, all non-priority water withdrawals are halted - only water usage for health and hydration purposes are authorised.Drought impacts everything from agriculture to tourism to even electricity production and the ability to cool nuclear reactors that power France.Thus far,. Tourists are also seeing the impacts of drought, particularly those in Charente-Maritime which has has banned outdoor beach showers to conserve water.For farmers, there is also serious concern about this year's harvest. \"TheIn order to cope with drought this summer in France, water agencies could spend up to an additional €100 million to help agricultural sectors adapt.Experts once again blame the climate crisis. \"The drought this year is clearly remarkable,\" said Florence Habets, hydroclimatologist and director of research at the CNRS to French daily Le Parisien The maps below show continued risk of drought across France from this point onward until the end of the summer, indicating much of the country will likely continue to be impacted.There are some points of particular concern, such as. It is located at the crossroads of the Hautes-Alpes and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence départements, and its water levelsMeanwhile, the National Federation of Fishing in France has launched a campaign to warn about the dangerous and continuous decline in river levels, which it believes is responsible for the disappearance of many species.said Loïc Obled, the deputy director general of the French Office of Biodiversity to Le Parisien"

        "Since the early days of the pandemic, evidence has consistently shown that Covid poses almost no risk to children. A major British study from last year estimated the survival rate for under 18s as 99.995%, and found that three quarters of under 18s who died from Covid had a serious underlying health condition.The study, authored by Valtyr Thors and colleagues, has one key advantage over previous studies: thanks to Iceland's small population and comprehensive record-keeping, the authors were able to identify all children infected with Covid up to August 31st 2021 (or very nearly all).This allows them to put upper bounds on the proportion of children who experience particular outcomes, such as death, hospitalisation or severe symptoms. It also means their findings can't be attributed to selection effects whereby certain types of children were more or less likely to take part.Thors and colleagues' main results are shown in the table below. Note: the criteria for \"mild\", \"moderate\" and \"severe\" symptoms are those given by the WHO (see Table 6.3 here ).Looking back at the table,, and more than 1 in 5 were completely asymptomatic. Interestingly, those aged 4-13 were more likely to be asymptomatic than both younger and older children.An important caveat is that Icelandic 16-17 year olds were vaccinated in April and May of 2021, which may have reduced the severity of symptoms in this group toward the end of the study period. However, this is unlikely to have had much impact on the results, since the vast majority of data correspond to unvaccinated children and/or the period prior to vaccination."

        "According to Icelandic online newspaper Fréttin , the Icelandic Medicines Agency has received 107 reports of side-effects of Covid vaccines in children, of which 11 are classified as serious.A serious adverse effect is defined as an effect of a drug that leads to death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation or that causes disability or birth defects in humans. Also, reports that are considered clinically important are classified as serious.The rate of reported versus experienced adverse effects, as well as the ratio of reported effects that actually are proven to be vaccine-induced, remain unclear, but according to estimates the reporting rate of adverse effects is quite low.What might then be the actual number and incidence rate of experienced serious adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines experienced by Icelandic children?In total, 41,814 children aged five to 17 have been injected (68.55% of the total number of children in this age group) and 11 serious adverse effects have been reported.It is interesting in this context to look at the findings from a recent Icelandic study, SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Icelandic Children , published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal. The study period is February 28th 2020 to August 31st 2021.Interestingly, two of the study authors took an active part in pushing for child vaccination early this year, despite their own findings.As reports of adverse effects are not investigated to determine causation, it is hard to determine what percentage of experienced adverse effects are actually caused by the vaccines. But the number of reports, coupled with the estimated reporting rate, compared with an expected rate of serious adverse effects from flu vaccines of one to two per million, indicates that the incidence is very high in comparison.This is similar to recent German figures Considering the aforementioned study which found serious complications from COVID-19 in children to be practically non-existent, this raises serious doubts about the continued push for child-vaccination.Thorsteinn Siglaugsson is an economist who lives in Iceland.

        "MASK-INEFFECTIVENESS\n\n1) Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers, Bundgaard, 2021 \"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results...the recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use.\"\n\n2) SARS-CoV-2 Transmission among Marine Recruits during Quarantine, Letizia, 2020 \"Our study showed that in a group of predominantly young male military recruits, approximately 2% became positive for SARS-CoV-2, as determined by qPCR assay, during a 2-week, strictly enforced quarantine. Multiple, independent virus strain transmission clusters were identified...all recruits wore double-layered cloth masks at all times indoors and outdoors.\"\n\n3) Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, Jefferson, 2020 \"There is low certainty evidence from nine trials (3507 participants) that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the outcome of influenza‐like illness (ILI) compared to not wearing a mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.18. There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory‐confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants)...the pooled results of randomised trials did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks during seasonal influenza.\"\n\n4) The Impact of Community Masking on COVID-19: A Cluster-Randomized Trial in Bangladesh, Abaluck, 2021\n\n\n\nHeneghan et al. A cluster-randomized trial of community-level mask promotion in rural Bangladesh from November 2020 to April 2021 (N=600 villages, N=342,126 adults. Heneghan writes: \"In a Bangladesh study, surgical masks reduced symptomatic COVID infections by between 0 and 22 percent, while the efficacy of cloth masks led to somewhere between an 11 percent increase to a 21 percent decrease. Hence, based on these randomized studies, adult masks appear to have either no or limited efficacy.\"\n\n5) Evidence for Community Cloth Face Masking to Limit the Spread of SARS-CoV-2: A Critical Review, Liu/CATO, 2021 \"The available clinical evidence of facemask efficacy is of low quality and the best available clinical evidence has mostly failed to show efficacy, with fourteen of sixteen identified randomized controlled trials comparing face masks to no mask controls failing to find statistically significant benefit in the intent-to-treat populations. Of sixteen quantitative meta-analyses, eight were equivocal or critical as to whether evidence supports a public recommendation of masks, and the remaining eight supported a public mask intervention on limited evidence primarily on the basis of the precautionary principle.\"\n\n6) Nonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings — Personal Protective and Environmental Measures, CDC/Xiao, 2020 \"Evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza...none of the household studies reported a significant reduction in secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the face mask group...the overall reduction in ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in the face mask group was not significant in either studies.\"\n\n7) CIDRAP: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data, Brosseau, 2020 \"We agree that the data supporting the effectiveness of a cloth mask or face covering are very limited. We do, however, have data from laboratory studies that indicate cloth masks or face coverings offer very low filter collection efficiency for the smaller inhalable particles we believe are largely responsible for transmission, particularly from pre- or asymptomatic individuals who are not coughing or sneezing...though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.\"\n\n8) Universal Masking in Hospitals in the Covid-19 Era, Klompas/NEJM, 2020 \"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic...The calculus may be different, however, in health care settings. First and foremost, a mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection...universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it's not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues. Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures.\"\n\n9) Masks for prevention of viral respiratory infections among health care workers and the public: PEER umbrella systematic review, Dugré, 2020 \"This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections. In the community setting, a possible reduced risk of influenza-like illness was found among mask users. In health care workers, the results show no difference between N95 masks and surgical masks on the risk of confirmed influenza or other confirmed viral respiratory infections, although possible benefits from N95 masks were found for preventing influenza-like illness or other clinical respiratory infections. Surgical masks might be superior to cloth masks but data are limited to 1 trial.\"\n\n11) Experimental investigation of indoor aerosol dispersion and accumulation in the context of COVID-19: Effects of masks and ventilation, Shah, 2021 \"Nevertheless, high-efficiency masks, such as the KN95, still offer substantially higher apparent filtration efficiencies (60% and 46% for R95 and KN95 masks, respectively) than the more commonly used cloth (10%) and surgical masks (12%), and therefore are still the recommended choice in mitigating airborne disease transmission indoors.\"\n\n12) Exercise with facemask; Are we handling a devil's sword?- A physiological hypothesis, Chandrasekaran, 2020 \"Exercising with facemasks may reduce available Oxygen and increase air trapping preventing substantial carbon dioxide exchange. The hypercapnic hypoxia may potentially increase acidic environment, cardiac overload, anaerobic metabolism and renal overload, which may substantially aggravate the underlying pathology of established chronic diseases. Further contrary to the earlier thought, no evidence exists to claim the facemasks during exercise offer additional protection from the droplet transfer of the virus.\"\n\n13) Surgical face masks in modern operating rooms-a costly and unnecessary ritual?, Mitchell, 1991 \"Following the commissioning of a new suite of operating rooms air movement studies showed a flow of air away from the operating table towards the periphery of the room. Oral microbial flora dispersed by unmasked male and female volunteers standing one metre from the table failed to contaminate exposed settle plates placed on the table. The wearing of face masks by non-scrubbed staff working in an operating room with forced ventilation seems to be unnecessary.\"\n\n14) Facemask against viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims: A challenging cluster-randomized trial, Alfelali, 2020 \"By intention-to-treat analysis, facemask use did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.1, p = 0.18) nor against clinical respiratory infection (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.4, p = 0.40).\"\n\n15) Simple respiratory protection-evaluation of the filtration performance of cloth masks and common fabric materials against 20-1000 nm size particles, Rengasamy, 2010 \"Results obtained in the study show that common fabric materials may provide marginal protection against nanoparticles including those in the size ranges of virus-containing particles in exhaled breath.\"\n\n16) Respiratory performance offered by N95 respirators and surgical masks: human subject evaluation with NaCl aerosol representing bacterial and viral particle size range, Lee, 2008 \"The study indicates that N95 filtering facepiece respirators may not achieve the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses. An exhalation valve on the N95 respirator does not affect the respiratory protection; it appears to be an appropriate alternative to reduce the breathing resistance.\"\n\n17) Aerosol penetration and leakage characteristics of masks used in the health care industry, Weber, 1993 \"We conclude that the protection provided by surgical masks may be insufficient in environments containing potentially hazardous sub-micrometer-sized aerosols.\"\n\n18) Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery, Vincent, 2016 \"We included three trials, involving a total of 2106 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the masked and unmasked group in any of the trials...from the limited results it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by members of the surgical team has any impact on surgical wound infection rates for patients undergoing clean surgery.\"\n\n19) Disposable surgical face masks: a systematic review, Lipp, 2005 \"From the limited results it is unclear whether wearing surgical face masks results in any harm or benefit to the patient undergoing clean surgery.\"\n\n20) Comparison of the Filter Efficiency of Medical Nonwoven Fabrics against Three Different Microbe Aerosols, Shimasaki, 2018 \"We conclude that the filter efficiency test using the phi-X174 phage aerosol may overestimate the protective performance of nonwoven fabrics with filter structure compared to that against real pathogens such as the influenza virus.\"\n\n21) The use of masks and respirators to preventtransmission of inﬂuenza: a systematic review of thescientiﬁc evidence21) The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence, Bin-Reza, 2012 The use of masks and respirators to preventtransmission of inﬂuenza: a systematic review of thescientiﬁc evidence\"None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some evidence suggests that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially hand hygiene.\"\n\n22) Facial protection for healthcare workers during pandemics: a scoping review, Godoy, 2020 \"Compared with surgical masks, N95 respirators perform better in laboratory testing, may provide superior protection in inpatient settings and perform equivalently in outpatient settings. Surgical mask and N95 respirator conservation strategies include extended use, reuse or decontamination, but these strategies may result in inferior protection. Limited evidence suggests that reused and improvised masks should be used when medical-grade protection is unavailable.\"\n\n23) Assessment of Proficiency of N95 Mask Donning Among the General Public in Singapore, Yeung, 2020 \"These findings support ongoing recommendations against the use of N95 masks by the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.5 N95 mask use by the general public may not translate into effective protection but instead provide false reassurance. Beyond N95 masks, proficiency among the general public in donning surgical masks needs to be assessed.\"\n\n24) Evaluating the efficacy of cloth facemasks in reducing particulate matter exposure, Shakya, 2017 \"Standard N95 mask performance was used as a control to compare the results with cloth masks, and our results suggest that cloth masks are only marginally beneficial in protecting individuals from particles<2.5 μm.\"\n\n25) Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: a randomized controlled trial, Jacobs, 2009 \"Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.\"\n\n26) N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel, Radonovich, 2019 \"Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.\"\n\n27) Does Universal Mask Wearing Decrease or Increase the Spread of COVID-19?, Watts up with that? 2020 \"A survey of peer-reviewed studies shows that universal mask wearing (as opposed to wearing masks in specific settings) does not decrease the transmission of respiratory viruses from people wearing masks to people who are not wearing masks.\"\n\n28) Masking: A Careful Review of the Evidence, Alexander, 2021 \"In fact, it is not unreasonable at this time to conclude that surgical and cloth masks, used as they currently are, have absolutely no impact on controlling the transmission of Covid-19 virus, and current evidence implies that face masks can be actually harmful.\"\n\n29) Community and Close Contact Exposures Associated with COVID-19 Among Symptomatic Adults ≥18 Years in 11 Outpatient Health Care Facilities — United States, July 2020, Fisher, 2020 Reported characteristics of symptomatic adults ≥18 years who were outpatients in 11 US academic health care facilities and who received positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (N = 314)* — United States, July 1-29, 2020, revealed that 80% of infected persons wore face masks almost all or most of the time.\n\n30) Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 in Europe: a quasi-experimental study, Hunter, 2020 Face masks in public was not associated with reduced incidence.\n\n31) Masking lack of evidence with politics, CEBM, Heneghan, 2020 \"It would appear that despite two decades of pandemic preparedness, there is considerable uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks. For instance, high rates of infection with cloth masks could be due to harms caused by cloth masks, or benefits of medical masks. The numerous systematic reviews that have been recently published all include the same evidence base so unsurprisingly broadly reach the same conclusions.\"\n\n32) Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study, Marks, 2021 \"We observed no association of risk of transmission with reported mask usage by contacts, with the age or sex of the index case, or with the presence of respiratory symptoms in the index case at the initial study visit.\"\n\n33) Non-pharmaceutical public health measures for mitigating the risk and impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza, WHO, 2020 \"Ten RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and there was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.\"\n\n34) The Strangely Unscientific Masking of America, Younes, 2020 \"One report reached its conclusion based on observations of a \"dummy head attached to a breathing simulator.\" Another analyzed use of surgical masks on people experiencing at least two symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Incidentally, not one of these studies involved cloth masks or accounted for real-world mask usage (or misusage) among lay people, and none established efficacy of widespread mask-wearing by people not exhibiting symptoms.

You compare the rates of infection in a masked cohort against rates of infection in an unmasked cohort. Here things have gone much, much worse for mask brigade. They spent months trying to prevent the publication of the Danish randomised controlled trial, which found that masks do zero. When that paper finally squeaked into print, they spent more months trying desperately to poke holes in it. You could feel their boundless relief when the Bangladesh study finally appeared to save them in early September. Every last Twitter blue-check could now proclaim that Science Shows Masks Work. Such was their hunger for any scrap of evidence to prop up their prior convictions, that none of them noticed the sad nature of the Science in question. The study found a mere 10% reduction in seroprevalence among the masked cohort, an effect so small that it fell within the confidence interval.

Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.\"\n\n60) Mouth-nose protection in public: No evidence of effectiveness, Thieme/ Kappstein, 2020 \"The use of masks in public spaces is questionable simply because of the lack of scientific data. If one also considers the necessary precautions, masks must even be considered a risk of infection in public spaces according to the rules known from hospitals... If masks are worn by the population, the risk of infection is potentially increased, regardless of whether they are medical masks or whether they are so-called community masks designed in any way. If one considers the precautionary measures that the RKI as well as the international health authorities have pronounced, all authorities would even have to inform the population that masks should not be worn in public spaces at all. Because no matter whether it is a duty for all citizens or voluntarily borne by the citizens who want it for whatever reason, it remains a fact that masks can do more harm than good in public.\"\n\n61) US mask guidance for kids is the strictest across the world, Skelding, 2021 \"Kids need to see faces,\" Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, told The Post. Youngsters watch people's mouths to learn to speak, read and understand emotions, he said.\"We have this idea that this disease is so bad that we must adopt any means necessary to stop it from spreading,\" he said. \"It's not that masks in schools have no costs. They actually do have substantial costs.\"\n\n62) Masking young children in school harms language acquisition, Walsh, 2021 \"This is important because children and/or students do not have the speech or language ability that adults have — they are not equally able and the ability to see the face and especially the mouth is critical to language acquisition which children and/or students are engaged in at all times. Furthermore, the ability to see the mouth is not only essential to communication but also essential to brain development.\"\n\n63) The Case Against Masks for Children, Makary, 2021 \"It's abusive to force kids who struggle with them to sacrifice for the sake of unvaccinated adults... Do masks reduce Covid transmission in children? Believe it or not, we could find only a single retrospective study on the question, and its results were inconclusive. Yet two weeks ago the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sternly decreed that 56 million U.S. children and adolescents, vaccinated or not, should cover their faces regardless of the prevalence of infection in their community. Authorities in many places took the cue to impose mandates in schools and elsewhere, on the theory that masks can't do any harm. That isn't true. Some children are fine wearing a mask, but others struggle. Those who have myopia can have difficulty seeing because the mask fogs their glasses. (This has long been a problem for medical students in the operating room.) Masks can cause severe acne and other skin problems. The discomfort of a mask distracts some children from learning. By increasing airway resistance during exhalation, masks can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. And masks can be vectors for pathogens if they become moist or are used for too long.\"\n\n64) Face Covering Mandates, Peavey, 2021 \"Face Covering Mandates And Why They AREN'T Effective.\"\n\n65) Do masks work?

With tens of millions of American kids headed back to school in the fall, their parents and political leaders owe it to them to have a clear-sighted, scientifically rigorous discussion about which anti-COVID measures actually work and which might put an extra burden on vulnerable young people without meaningfully or demonstrably slowing the spread of the virus...that a masking requirement of students failed to show independent benefit is a finding of consequence and great interest.\"\n\n69) World Health Organization internal meeting, COVID-19 - virtual press conference - 30 March 2020, 2020 \"This is a question on Austria. The Austrian Government has a desire to make everyone wear a mask who's going into the shops. I understood from our previous briefings with you that the general public should not wear masks because they are in short supply. What do you say about the new Austrian measures?... I'm not specifically aware of that measure in Austria. I would assume that it's aimed at people who potentially have the disease not passing it to others. In general WHO recommends that the wearing of a mask by a member of the public is to prevent that individual giving the disease to somebody else. We don't generally recommend the wearing to masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not been up to now associated with any particular benefit.\"\n\n70) Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: a systematic review, Cowling, 2010 \"Review highlights the limited evidence base supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of face masks to reduce influenza virus transmission.\"\"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H).\"\n\n71) Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Smith, 2016 \"Although N95 respirators appeared to have a protective advantage over surgical masks in laboratory settings, our meta-analysis showed that there were insufficient data to determine definitively whether N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks in protecting health care workers against transmissible acute respiratory infections in clinical settings.\"\n\n72) Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Offeddu, 2017 \"We found evidence to support universal medical mask use in hospital settings as part of infection control measures to reduce the risk of CRI and ILI among HCWs. Overall, N95 respirators may convey greater protection, but universal use throughout a work shift is likely to be less acceptable due to greater discomfort...Our analysis confirms the effectiveness of medical masks and respirators against SARS. Disposable, cotton, or paper masks are not recommended. The confirmed effectiveness of medical masks is crucially important for lower-resource and emergency settings lacking access to N95 respirators. In such cases, single-use medical masks are preferable to cloth masks, for which there is no evidence of protection and which might facilitate transmission of pathogens when used repeatedly without adequate sterilization...We found no clear benefit of either medical masks or N95 respirators against pH1N1...Overall, the evidence to inform policies on mask use in HCWs is poor, with a small number of studies that is prone to reporting biases and lack of statistical power.\"\n\n73) N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel, Radonovich, 2019 \"Use of N95 respirators, compared with medical masks, in the outpatient setting resulted in no significant difference in the rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza.\"\n\nEffectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks againstinfluenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis74) Masks Don't Work: A Review of Science Relevant to COVID-19 Social Policy, Rancourt, 2020 The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with alower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be rec-ommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact withinfluenza patients or suspected patients. \"No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public (more on this below). Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit.\"\n\n75) More Than a Dozen Credible Medical Studies Prove Face Masks Do Not Work Even In Hospitals!, Firstenberg, 2020 \"Mandating masks has not kept death rates down anywhere. The 20 U.S. states that have never ordered people to wear face masks indoors and out have dramatically lower COVID-19 death rates than the 30 states that have mandated masks. Most of the no-mask states have COVID-19 death rates below 20 per 100,000 population, and none have a death rate higher than 55.

No infections were found in any patient, regardless of whether a cap or mask was used. Thus, we found no evidence that caps or masks need to be worn during percutaneous cardiac catheterization.\"\n\n81) Do anaesthetists need to wear surgical masks in the operating theatre? A literature review with evidence-based recommendations, Skinner, 2001 \"A questionnaire-based survey, undertaken by Leyland' in 1993 to assess attitudes to the use of masks, showed that 20% of surgeons discarded surgical masks for endoscopic work. Less than 50% did not wear the mask as recommended by the Medical Research Council. Equal numbers of surgeons wore the mask in the belief they were protecting themselves and the patient, with 20% of these admitting that tradition was the only reason for wearing them.\"\n\n82) Mask mandates for children are not backed by data, Faria, 2021 \"Even if you want to use the 2018-19 flu season to avoid overlap with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC paints a similar picture: It estimated 480 flu deaths among children during that period, with 46,000 hospitalizations. COVID-19, mercifully, is simply not as deadly for children. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, preliminary data from 45 states show that between 0.00%-0.03% of child COVID-19 cases resulted in death. When you combine these numbers with the CDC study that found mask mandates for students — along with hybrid models, social distancing, and classroom barriers — did not have a statistically significant benefit in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in schools, the insistence that we force students to jump through these hoops for their own protection makes no sense.\"\n\n83) The Downsides of Masking Young Students Are Real, Prasad, 2021 \"The benefits of mask requirements in schools might seem self-evident — they have to help contain the coronavirus, right? — but that may not be so. In Spain, masks are used in kids ages 6 and older. The authors of one study there examined the risk of viral spread at all ages. If masks provided a large benefit, then the transmission rate among 5-year-olds would be far higher than the rate among 6-year-olds. The results don't show that. Instead, they show that transmission rates, which were low among the youngest kids, steadily increased with age — rather than dropping sharply for older children subject to the face-covering requirement. This suggests that masking kids in school does not provide a major benefit and might provide none at all. And yet many officials prefer to double down on masking mandates, as if the fundamental policy were sound and only the people have failed.\"\n\n84) Masks In Schools: Scientific American Fumbles Report On Childhood COVID Transmission, English/ACSH, 2021 \"Masking is a low-risk, inexpensive intervention.

In mid-March 2020, few could argue against erring on the side of caution.

Six-year-old children showed higher incidence than 5 year-olds (3·54% vs 3·1%; OR: 1·15 [95%CI: 1·08-1·22]) and slightly lower but not statistically significant SAR and R*: SAR were 4·36% in 6 year-old children, and 4·59% in 5 year-old (IRR: 0·96 [95%CI: 0·82-1·11]); and R* was 0·9 and 0·93 (OR: 0·96 [95%CI: 0·87-1·09]), respectively.\" Overall, facial covering mandates (face masks) in examined schools were not linked to lower SARS-CoV-2 incidence or spread, implying that these masks were not effective.\"\n\n99) Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe, Spira, 2022 \"The aim of this short study was to analyse the correlation between mask usage against morbidity and mortality rates in the 2020-2021 winter in Europe. Data from 35 European countries on morbidity, mortality, and mask usage during a six-month period were analysed and crossed. Mask usage was more homogeneous in Eastern Europe than in Western European countries. Spearman's correlation coefficients between mask usage and COVID-19 outcomes were either null or positive, depending on the subgroup of countries and type of outcome (cases or deaths). Positive correlations were stronger in Western than in Eastern European countries. These findings indicate that countries with high levels of mask compliance did not perform better than those with low mask usage.\"\n\n100) The Foegen effect\n\nA mechanism by which facemasks contribute to the COVID-19 case fatality rate, Fögen, 2022 \"The most important finding from this study is that contrary to the accepted thought that fewer people are dying because infection rates are reduced by masks, this was not the case. Results from this study strongly suggest that mask mandates actually caused about 1.5 times the number of deaths or ∼50% more deaths compared to no mask mandates. This means that the risk for the individual wearing the mask should even be higher, because there is an unknown number of people in MMC who either do not obey mask mandates, are exempted for medical reasons or do not go to public places where mask mandates are in effect. These people do not have an increased risk and thus the risk on the other people under a mask mandate is actually higher.\"\n\n101) Association between School Mask Mandates and SARS-CoV-2 Student Infections: Evidence from a Natural Experiment of Neighboring K-12 Districts in North Dakota, Sood &Høeg, 2022 Unique study \"of two adjacent K-12 school districts in Fargo, North Dakota, one which had a mask mandate and one which did not in the fall of the 2021-2022 academic year. In the winter, both districts adopted a masks-optional policy allowing for a partial crossover study design. We observed no significant difference between student case rates while the districts had differing masking policies (IRR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.07) nor while they had the same mask policies (IRR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.16). The IRRs across the two periods were also not significantly different (p = 0.40).\" Researchers concluded that school-based mask mandates have \"limited to no impact on the case rates of COVID-19 among K-12 students.\"\n\nMASK MANDATES\n\n1) Mask mandate and use efficacy for COVID-19 containment in US States, Guerra, 2021 \"Calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance dates of neighboring states with mandates...did not observe association between mask mandates or use and reduced COVID-19 spread in US states.\"\n\n2) These 12 Graphs Show Mask Mandates Do Nothing To Stop COVID, Weiss, 2020 \"Masks can work well when they're fully sealed, properly fitted, changed often, and have a filter designed for virus-sized particles. This represents none of the common masks available on the consumer market, making universal masking much more of a confidence trick than a medical solution...Our universal use of unscientific face coverings is therefore closer to medieval superstition than it is to science, but many powerful institutions have too much political capital invested in the mask narrative at this point, so the dogma is perpetuated. The narrative says that if cases go down it's because masks succeeded. It says that if cases go up it's because masks succeeded in preventing more cases. The narrative simply assumes rather than proves that masks work, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.\"\n\n3) Mask Mandates Seem to Make CCP Virus Infection Rates Climb, Study Says, Vadum, 2020 \"Protective-mask mandates aimed at combating the spread of the CCP virus that causes the disease COVID-19 appear to promote its spread, according to a report from RationalGround.com, a clearinghouse of COVID-19 data trends that's run by a grassroots group of data analysts, computer scientists, and actuaries.\"\n\n4) Horowitz: Comprehensive analysis of 50 states shows greater spread with mask mandates, Howorwitz, 2020\n\n\n\nJustin Hart \"How long do our politicians get to ignore the results?... The results: When comparing states with mandates vs. those without, or periods of times within a state with a mandate vs. without, there is absolutely no evidence the mask mandate worked to slow the spread one iota. In total, in the states that had a mandate in effect, there were 9,605,256 confirmed COVID cases over 5,907 total days, an average of 27 cases per 100,000 per day. When states did not have a statewide order (which includes the states that never had them and the period of time masking states did not have the mandate in place) there were 5,781,716 cases over 5,772 total days, averaging 17 cases per 100,000 people per day.\"\n\n5) The CDC's Mask Mandate Study: Debunked, Alexander, 2021 \"Thus, it is not surprising that the CDC's own recent conclusion on the use of nonpharmaceutical measures such as face masks in pandemic influenza, warned that scientific \"evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission...\" Moreover, in the WHO's 2019 guidance document on nonpharmaceutical public health measures in a pandemic, they reported as to face masks that \"there is no evidence that this is effective in reducing transmission...\" Similarly, in the fine print to a recent double-blind, double-masking simulation the CDC stated that \"The findings of these simulations [supporting mask usage] should neither be generalized to the effectiveness ...nor interpreted as being representative of the effectiveness of these masks when worn in real-world settings.\"\n\n6) Phil Kerpin, tweet, 2021\n\n\n\nThe Spectator \"The first ecological study of state mask mandates and use to include winter data: \"Case growth was independent of mandates at low and high rates of community spread, and mask use did not predict case growth during the Summer or Fall-Winter waves.\"\n\n7) How face masks and lockdowns failed, SPR, 2021 \"Infections have been driven primarily by seasonal and endemic factors, whereas mask mandates and lockdowns have had no discernible impact\"\n\n8) Analysis of the Effects of COVID-19 Mask Mandates on Hospital Resource Consumption and Mortality at the County Level, Schauer, 2021 \"There was no reduction in per-population daily mortality, hospital bed, ICU bed, or ventilator occupancy of COVID-19-positive patients attributable to the implementation of a mask-wearing mandate.\"\n\n9) Do we need mask mandates, Harris, 2021 \"But masks proved far less useful in the subsequent 1918 Spanish flu, a viral disease spread by pathogens smaller than bacteria. California's Department of Health, for instance, reported that the cities of Stockton, which required masks, and Boston, which did not, had scarcely different death rates, and so advised against mask mandates except for a few high-risk professions such as barbers....Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on mask use, generally more reliable than observational studies, though not infallible, typically show that cloth and surgical masks offer little protection. A few RCTs suggest that perfect adherence to an exacting mask protocol may guard against influenza, but meta-analyses find little on the whole to suggest that masks offer meaningful protection. WHO guidelines from 2019 on influenza say that despite \"mechanistic plausibility for the potential effectiveness\" of masks, studies showed a benefit too small to be established with any certainty. Another literature review by researchers from the University of Hong Kong agrees. Its best estimate for the protective effect of surgical masks against influenza, based on ten RCTs published through 2018, was just 22 percent, and it could not rule out zero effect.\"\n\nMASK HARMS\n\n1) Corona children studies: Co-Ki: First results of a German-wide registry on mouth and nose covering (mask) in children, Schwarz, 2021 \"The average wearing time of the mask was 270 minutes per day. Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68% of the parents. These included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%).\"\n\n2) Dangerous pathogens found on children's face masks, Cabrera, 2021 \"Masks were contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, including three with dangerous pathogenic and pneumonia-causing bacteria.\"\n\n3) Masks, false safety and real dangers, Part 2: Microbial challenges from masks, Borovoy, 2020/2021 \"Laboratory testing of used masks from 20 train commuters revealed that 11 of the 20 masks tested contained over 100,000 bacterial colonies. Molds and yeasts were also found. Three of the masks contained more than one million bacterial colonies... The outside surfaces of surgical masks were found to have high levels of the following microbes, even in hospitals, more concentrated on the outside of masks than in the environment. Staphylococcus species (57%) and Pseudomonas spp (38%) were predominant among bacteria, and Penicillium spp (39%) and Aspergillus spp. (31%) were the predominant fungi.\"\n\n4) Preliminary report on surgical mask induced deoxygenation during major surgery, Beder, 2008 \"Considering our findings, pulse rates of the surgeon's increase and SpO2 decrease after the first hour. This early change in SpO2 may be either due to the facial mask or the operational stress. Since a very small decrease in saturation at this level, reflects a large decrease in PaO2, our findings may have a clinical value for the health workers and the surgeons.\"\n\n5) Mask mandates may affect a child's emotional, intellectual development, Gillis, 2020 \"The thing is we really don't know for sure what the effect may or may not be. But what we do know is that children, especially in early childhood, they use the mouth as part of the entire face to get a sense of what's going on around them in terms of adults and other people in their environment as far as their emotions. It also has a role in language development as well... If you think about an infant, when you interact with them you use part of your mouth. They are interested in your facial expressions. And if you think about that part of the face being covered up, there is that possibility that it could have an effect. But we don't know because this is really an unprecedented time. What we wonder about is if this could play a role and how can we stop it if it would affect child development.\"\n\n6) Headaches and the N95 face-mask amongst healthcare providers, Lim, 2006 \"Healthcare providers may develop headaches following the use of the N95 face-mask.\"\n\n7) Maximizing Fit for Cloth and Medical Procedure Masks to Improve Performance and Reduce SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Exposure, 2021, Brooks, 2021 \"Although use of double masking or knotting and tucking are two of many options that can optimize fit and enhance mask performance for source control and for wearer protection, double masking might impede breathing or obstruct peripheral vision for some wearers, and knotting and tucking can change the shape of the mask such that it no longer covers fully both the nose and the mouth of persons with larger faces.\"\n\n8) Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis, Vainshelboim, 2021 \"Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects.

Reports coming from my colleagues, all over the world, are suggesting that the bacterial pneumonias are on the rise...Why might that be? Because untrained members of the public are wearing medical masks, repeatedly... in a non-sterile fashion... They're becoming contaminated. They're pulling them off of their car seat, off the rear-view mirror, out of their pocket, from their countertop, and they're reapplying a mask that should be worn fresh and sterile every single time.\"\n\n12) Open Letter from Medical Doctors and Health Professionals to All Belgian Authorities and All Belgian Media, AIER, 2020 \"Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask.\"\n\n13) Face coverings for covid-19: from medical intervention to social practice, Peters, 2020 \"At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on Covid19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including Covid19. Contamination of the upper respiratory tract by viruses and bacteria on the outside of medical face masks has been detected in several hospitals. Another research shows that a moist mask is a breeding ground for (antibiotic resistant) bacteria and fungi, which can undermine mucosal viral immunity. This research advocates the use of medical / surgical masks (instead of homemade cotton masks) that are used once and replaced after a few hours.\"\n\n14) Face masks for the public during the covid-19 crisis, Lazzarino, 2020 \"The two potential side effects that have already been acknowledged are: (1) Wearing a face mask may give a false sense of security and make people adopt a reduction in compliance with other infection control measures, including social distancing and hands washing. (2) Inappropriate use of face mask: people must not touch their masks, must change their single-use masks frequently or wash them regularly, dispose them correctly and adopt other management measures, otherwise their risks and those of others may increase. Other potential side effects that we must consider are: (3) The quality and the volume of speech between two people wearing masks is considerably compromised and they may unconsciously come closer. While one may be trained to counteract side effect n.1, this side effect may be more difficult to tackle. (4) Wearing a face mask makes the exhaled air go into the eyes. This generates an uncomfortable feeling and an impulse to touch your eyes. If your hands are contaminated, you are infecting yourself.\"\n\n15) Contamination by respiratory viruses on outer surface of medical masks used by hospital healthcare workers, Chughtai, 2019 \"Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (> 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact. Protocols on duration of mask use should specify a maximum time of continuous use, and should consider guidance in high contact settings.\"\n\n16) Reusability of Facemasks During an Influenza Pandemic, Bailar, 2006 \"After considering all the testimony and other information we received, the committee concluded that there is currently no simple, reliable way to decontaminate these devices and enable people to use them safely more than once. There is relatively little data available about how effective these devices are against flu even the first time they are used. To the extent they can help at all, they must be used correctly, and the best respirator or mask will do little to protect a person who uses it incorrectly. Substantial research must be done to increase our understanding of how flu spreads, to develop better masks and respirators, and to make it easier to decontaminate them. Finally, the use of face coverings is only one of many strategies that will be needed to slow or halt a pandemic, and people should not engage in activities that would increase their risk of exposure to flu just because they have a mask or respirator.\"\n\n17) Exhalation of respiratory viruses by breathing, coughing, and talking, Stelzer-Braid, 2009 \"The exhaled aerosols generated by coughing, talking, and breathing were sampled in 50 subjects using a novel mask, and analyzed using PCR for nine respiratory viruses. The exhaled samples from a subset of 10 subjects who were PCR positive for rhinovirus were also examined by cell culture for this virus. Of the 50 subjects, among the 33 with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, 21 had at least one virus detected by PCR, while amongst the 17 asymptomatic subjects, 4 had a virus detected by PCR. Overall, rhinovirus was detected in 19 subjects, influenza in 4 subjects, parainfluenza in 2 subjects, and human metapneumovirus in 1 subject. Two subjects were co-infected. Of the 25 subjects who had virus-positive nasal mucus, the same virus type was detected in 12 breathing samples, 8 talking samples, and in 2 coughing samples. In the subset of exhaled samples from 10 subjects examined by culture, infective rhinovirus was detected in 2.\"\n\n18) [Effect of a surgical mask on six minute walking distance], Person, 2018 \"Wearing a surgical mask modifies significantly and clinically dyspnea without influencing walked distance.\"\n\n19) Protective masks reduce resilience, Science ORF, 2020 \"The German researchers used two types of face masks for their study - surgical masks and so-called FFP2 masks, which are mainly used by medical personnel. The measurements were carried out with the help of spiroergometry, in which patients or in this case the test persons exert themselves physically on a stationary bicycle - a so-called ergometer - or a treadmill. The subjects were examined without a mask, with surgical masks and with FFP2 masks. The masks therefore impair breathing, especially the volume and the highest possible speed of the air when exhaling. The maximum possible force on the ergometer was significantly reduced.\"\n\n20) Wearing masks even more unhealthy than expected, Coronoa transition, 2020 \"They contain microplastics - and they exacerbate the waste problem...\"Many of them are made of polyester and so you have a microplastic problem.\" Many of the face masks would contain polyester with chlorine compounds: \"If I have the mask in front of my face, then of course I breathe in the microplastic directly and these substances are much more toxic than if you swallow them, as they get directly into the nervous system,\" Braungart continues.\"\n\n21) Masking Children: Tragic, Unscientific, and Damaging, Alexander, 2021 \"Children do not readily acquire SARS-CoV-2 (very low risk), spread it to other children or teachers, or endanger parents or others at home. This is the settled science. In the rare cases where a child contracts Covid virus it is very unusual for the child to get severely ill or die. Masking can do positive harm to children - as it can to some adults. But the cost benefit analysis is entirely different for adults and children - particularly younger children. Whatever arguments there may be for consenting adults - children should not be required to wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Of course, zero risk is not attainable - with or without masks, vaccines, therapeutics, distancing or anything else medicine may develop or government agencies may impose.\"\n\n22) The Dangers of Masks, Alexander, 2021 \"With that clarion call, we pivot and refer here to another looming concern and this is the potential danger of the chlorine, polyester, and microplastic components of the face masks (surgical principally but any of the mass-produced masks) that have become part of our daily lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We hope those with persuasive power in the government will listen to this plea. We hope that the necessary decisions will be made to reduce the risk to our populations.\"\n\n23) 13-year-old mask wearer dies for inexplicable reasons, Corona Transition, 2020 \"The case is not only causing speculation in Germany about possible poisoning with carbon dioxide. Because the student \"was wearing a corona protective mask when she suddenly collapsed and died a little later in the hospital,\" writes Wochenblick.Editor's Review: The fact that no cause of death was communicated nearly three weeks after the girl's death is indeed unusual. The carbon dioxide content of the air is usually about 0.04 percent. From a proportion of four percent, the first symptoms of hypercapnia, i.e. carbon dioxide poisoning, appear. If the proportion of the gas rises to more than 20 percent, there is a risk of deadly carbon dioxide poisoning. However, this does not come without alarm signals from the body. According to the medical portal netdoktor, these include \"sweating, accelerated breathing, accelerated heartbeat, headaches, confusion, loss of consciousness\". The unconsciousness of the girl could therefore be an indication of such poisoning.\"\n\n24) Student Deaths Lead Chinese Schools to Change Mask Rules, that's, 2020 \"During the month of April, three cases of students suffering sudden cardiac death (SCD) while running during gym class have been reported in Zhejiang, Henan and Hunan provinces.

Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.\"\n\n26) The mask requirement is responsible for severe psychological damage and the weakening of the immune system, Coronoa Transition, 2020 \"In fact, the mask has the potential to \"trigger strong psychovegetative stress reactions via emerging aggression, which correlate significantly with the degree of stressful after-effects\".\n\n\n\nProusa is not alone in her opinion.

Also, depending on the mask and the fit, the child may have trouble breathing. If this happens, they need to be able to take it off,\" said UC Davis pediatrician Lena van der List. \"Children less than 2 years of age will not reliably be able to remove a face mask and could suffocate. Therefore, masks should not routinely be used for young children...\"The younger the child, the more likely they will be to not wear the mask properly, reach under the mask and touch potentially contaminated masks,\" said Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children's Hospital. \"Of course, this depends on the developmental level of the individual child. But I think masks are not likely to provide much potential benefit over risk until the teen years.\"\n\n33) Covid-19: Important potential side effects of wearing face masks that we should bear in mind, Lazzarino, 2020 \"Other potential side effects that we must consider, however, are 1) The quality and volume of speech between people wearing masks is considerably compromised and they may unconsciously come closer2) Wearing a mask makes the exhaled air go into the eyes. This generates an impulse to touch the eyes. 3) If your hands are contaminated, you are infecting yourself, 4) Face masks make breathing more difficult. Moreover, a fraction of carbon dioxide previously exhaled is inhaled at each respiratory cycle. Those phenomena increase breathing frequency and deepness, and they may worsen the burden of covid-19 if infected people wearing masks spread more contaminated air. This may also worsen the clinical condition of infected people if the enhanced breathing pushes the viral load down into their lungs, 5) The innate immunity's efficacy is highly dependent on the viral load. If masks determine a humid habitat where SARS-CoV-2 can remain active because of the water vapour continuously provided by breathing and captured by the mask fabric, they determine an increase in viral load (by re-inhaling exhaled viruses) and therefore they can cause a defeat of the innate immunity and an increase in infections.\"\n\n34) Risks of N95 Face Mask Use in Subjects With COPD, Kyung, 2020 \"Of the 97 subjects, 7 with COPD did not wear the N95 for the entire test duration.

We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen depravation. There are nerve cells for example in the hippocampus, that can't be longer than 3 minutes without oxygen - they cannot survive. The acute warning symptoms are headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, issues in concentration, slowing down of the reaction time - reactions of the cognitive system. However, when you have chronic oxygen depravation, all of those symptoms disappear, because you get used to it. But your efficiency will remain impaired and the undersupply of oxygen in your brain continues to progress. We know that neurodegenerative diseases take years to decades to develop. If today you forget your phone number, the breakdown in your brain would have already started 20 or 30 years ago...The child needs the brain to learn, and the brain needs oxygen to function. We don't need a clinical study for that. This is simple, indisputable physiology. Conscious and purposely induced oxygen deficiency is an absolutely deliberate health hazard, and an absolute medical contraindication.\"\n\n38) Study shows how masks are harming children, Mercola, 2021 \"Data from the first registry to record children's experiences with masks show physical, psychological and behavioral issues including irritability, difficulty concentrating and impaired learning.Since school shutdowns in spring 2020, an increasing number of parents are seeking drug treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for their children.Evidence from the U.K. shows schools are not the super spreaders health officials said they were; measured rates of infection in schools were the same as the community, not higher.A large randomized controlled trial showed wearing masks does not reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\n39) New Study Finds Masks Hurt Schoolchildren Physically, Psychologically, and Behaviorally, Hall, 2021\n\n\n\nhttps://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-124394/v2 \"A new study, involving over 25,000 school-aged children, shows that masks are harming schoolchildren physically, psychologically, and behaviorally, revealing 24 distinct health issues associated with wearing masks...Though these results are concerning, the study also found that 29.7% of children experienced shortness of breath, 26.4% experienced dizziness, and hundreds of the participants experiencing accelerated respiration, tightness in chest, weakness, and short-term impairment of consciousness.\"\n\n40) Protective Face Masks: Effect on the Oxygenation and Heart Rate Status of Oral Surgeons during Surgery, Scarano, 2021 \"In all 20 surgeons wearing FFP2 covered by surgical masks, a reduction in arterial O 2 saturation from around 97.5% before surgery to 94% after surgery was recorded with increase of heart rates. A shortness of breath and light-headedness/headaches were also noted.\"\n\n41) Effects of surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, Fikenzer, 2020 \"Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals. These data are important for recommendations on wearing face masks at work or during physical exercise.\"\n\n42) Headaches Associated With Personal Protective Equipment - A Cross-Sectional Study Among Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19, Ong, 2020 \"Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.\"\n\n43) Open letter from medical doctors and health professionals to all Belgian authorities and all Belgian media, The American Institute of Stress, 2020 \"Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems, and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask.\"\n\n44) Reusing masks may increase your risk of coronavirus infection, expert says, Laguipo, 2020 \"For the public, they should not wear facemasks unless they are sick, and if a healthcare worker advised them.\"For the average member of the public walking down a street, it is not a good idea,\" Dr. Harries said.\"What tends to happen is people will have one mask. They won't wear it all the time, they will take it off when they get home, they will put it down on a surface they haven't cleaned,\" she added.Further, she added that behavioral issues could adversely put themselves at more risk of getting the infection. For instance, people go out and don't wash their hands, they touch parts of the mask or their face, and they get infected.\"\n\n45) What's Going On Under the Masks?, Wright, 2021 \"Americans today have pretty good chompers on average, at least relative to most other people, past and present. Nevertheless, we do not think enough about oral health as evidenced by the almost complete lack of discussion regarding the effect of lockdowns and mandatory masking on our mouths.\"\n\n46) Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air With or Without Face Masks in Healthy ChildrenA Randomized Clinical Trial, Walach, 2021 \"A large-scale surveyin Germany of adverse effects in parents and children using data of 25 930 children has shown that 68% of the participating children had problems when wearing nose and mouth coverings.\"\n\n48) Health Canada issues advisory for disposable masks with graphene, CBC, 2021 \"Health Canada is advising Canadians not to use disposable face masks that contain graphene. Health Canada issued the notice on Friday and said wearers could inhale graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms. Masks containing the toxic particles may have been distributed in some health-care facilities.\"\n\n49) COVID-19: Performance study of microplastic inhalation risk posed by wearing masks, Li, 2021\n\n\n\nIs graphene safe? \"Wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pre-treatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.\"\n\n50) Manufacturers have been using nanotechnology-derived graphene in face masks — now there are safety concerns, Maynard, 2021 \"Early concerns around graphene were sparked by previous research on another form of carbon — carbon nanotubes. It turns out that some forms of these fiber-like materials can cause serious harm if inhaled. And following on from research here, a natural next-question to ask is whether carbon nanotubes' close cousin graphene comes with similar concerns.Because graphene lacks many of the physical and chemical aspects of carbon nanotubes that make them harmful (such as being long, thin, and hard for the body to get rid of), the indications are that the material is safer than its nanotube cousins. But safer doesn't mean safe. And current research indicates that this is not a material that should be used where it could potentially be inhaled, without a good amount of safety testing first...As a general rule of thumb, engineered nanomaterials should not be used in products where they might inadvertently be inhaled and reach the sensitive lower regions of the lungs.\"\n\n51) Masking young children in school harms language acquisition, Walsh, 2021 \"This is important because children and/or students do not have the speech or language ability that adults have — they are not equally able and the ability to see the face and especially the mouth is critical to language acquisition which children and/or students are engaged in at all times. Furthermore, the ability to see the mouth is not only essential to communication but also essential to brain development.\"Studies show that by age four, kids from low-income households will hear 30 million less words than their more affluent counterparts, who get more quality face-time with caretakers.\" (https://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/november/language-toddlers-fernald-110514.html).\"\n\n52) Dangerous pathogens found on children's face masks, Rational Ground, 2021 \"A group of parents in Gainesville, FL, sent 6 face masks to a lab at the University of Florida, requesting an analysis of contaminants found on the masks after they had been worn. The resulting report found that five masks were contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, including three with dangerous pathogenic and pneumonia-causing bacteria. Although the test is capable of detecting viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, only one virus was found on one mask (alcelaphine herpesvirus 1)...Half of the masks were contaminated with one or more strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with one or more strains of meningitis-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. In addition, less dangerous pathogens were identified, including pathogens that can cause fever, ulcers, acne, yeast infections, strep throat, periodontal disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and more.\"\n\n53) Face mask dermatitis\" due to compulsory facial masks during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: data from 550 health care and non-health care workers in Germany, Niesert, 2021 \"The duration of wearing masks showed a significant impact on the prevalence of symptoms (p < 0.001). Type IV hypersensitivity was significantly more likely in participants with symptoms compared to those without symptoms (p = 0.001), whereas no increase in symptoms was observed in participants with atopic diathesis. HCWs used facial skin care products significantly more often than non-HCWs (p = 0.001).\"\n\n54) Effect of Wearing Face Masks on the Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Breathing Zone, AAQR/Geiss, 2020 \"Detected carbon dioxide concentrations ranged from 2150 ± 192 to 2875 ± 323 ppm. The concentrations of carbon dioxide while not wearing a face mask varied from 500-900 ppm. Doing office work and standing still on the treadmill each resulted in carbon dioxide concentrations of around 2200 ppm. A small increase could be observed when walking at a speed of 3 km h-1 (leisurely walking pace)...concentrations in the detected range can cause undesirable symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, and loss of concentration.\"\n\n55) Surgical masks as source of bacterial contamination during operative procedures, Zhiqing, 2018 \"The source of bacterial contamination in SMs was the body surface of the surgeons rather than the OR environment. Moreover, we recommend that surgeons should change the mask after each operation, especially those beyond 2 hours.\"\n\n56) The Damage of Masking Children Could be Irreparable, Hussey, 2021 \"When we surround children with mask-wearers for a year at a time, are we impairing their face barcode recognition during a period of hot neural development, thus putting full development of the FFA at risk? Does the demand for separation from others, reducing social interaction, add to the potential consequences as it might in autism? When can we be sure that we won't interfere with visual input to the face recognition visual neurology so we don't interfere with brain development? How much time with stimulus interference can we allow without consequences? Those are all questions currently without answers; we don't know. Unfortunately, the science implies that if we mess up brain development for faces, we may not currently have therapies to undo everything we've done.\"\n\n57) Masks can be Murder, Grossman, 2021 \"Wearing masks can create a sense of anonymity for an aggressor, while also dehumanizing the victim. This prevents empathy, empowering violence, and murder.\" Masking helps remove empathy and compassion, allowing others to commit unspeakable acts on the masked person.\"\n\n58) London high school teacher calls face masks an 'egregious and unforgivable form of child abuse, Butler, 2020 \"In his email, Farquharson called the campaign to legislate mask wearing a \"shameful farce, a charade, an act of political theatre\" that's more about enforcing \"obedience and compliance\" than it is about public health. He also likened children wearing masks to \"involuntary self-torture,\" calling it \"an egregious and unforgivable form of child abuse and physical assault.\"\n\n59) UK Government Advisor Admits Masks Are Just \"Comfort Blankets\" That Do Virtually Nothing, ZeroHedge, 2021 \"As the UK Government heralds \"freedom day\" today, which is anything but, a prominent government scientific advisor has admitted that face masks do very little to protect from coronavirus and are basically just \"comfort blankets...the professor noted that \"those aerosols escape masks and will render the mask ineffective,\" adding \"The public were demanding something must be done, they got masks, it is just a comfort blanket. But now it is entrenched, and we are entrenching bad behaviour...all around the world you can look at mask mandates and superimpose on infection rates, you cannot see that mask mandates made any effect whatsoever,\" Axon further noted, adding that \"The best thing you can say about any mask is that any positive effect they do have is too small to be measured.\"\n\n60) Masks, false safety and real dangers, Part 1: Friable mask particulate and lung vulnerability, Borovoy, 2020 \"Surgical personnel are trained to never touch any part of a mask, except the loops and the nose bridge. Otherwise, the mask is considered useless and is to be replaced. Surgical personnel are strictly trained not to touch their masks otherwise. However, the general public may be seen touching various parts of their masks. Even the masks just removed from manufacturer packaging have been shown in the above photos to contain particulate and fiber that would not be optimal to inhale... Further concerns of macrophage response and other immune and inflammatory and fibroblast response to such inhaled particles specifically from facemasks should be the subject of more research. If widespread masking continues, then the potential for inhaling mask fibers and environmental and biological debris continues on a daily basis for hundreds of millions of people. This should be alarming for physicians and epidemiologists knowledgeable in occupational hazards.\""

        "© Shuttertock/Pasonglit Junuan\n\n\n\nA concerning number of 'pandemic babies' with no immunity to respiratory viruses are ending up seriously ill in ICU.Doctors have revealed children born during the Covid-19 pandemic are requiring intensive care 'from encountering viruses they haven't come across before', such as influenza, RSV and Covid. The children had been born and raised when there were virtually no other viruses circulating in Australia, other than Covid-19.The Children's Hospital at Westmead infectious diseases paediatrician Dr Philip Britton said an analysis of ICU admissions across shows babies are testing positive for influenza and Covid at the same time.'Over the last month or so, we have seen four times the admissions to hospital for flu in children as for Covid,' Dr Britton told The Daily Telegraph.Dr Britton said five per cent of the children presenting with co-infections were being admitted to ICU, a statistic he described as 'very concerning'.with the elevated number of admissions putting pressure on the hospital system. Some of the 'pandemic babies' are presenting with inflammation of the chest, brain and heart caused by influenza, Covid, and RSV.RSV - respiratory syncytial virus - is a major cause of lung infections in children and can lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which is particularly dangerous in young infants.Severe cases can kill babies and toddlers, whose tiny airways have not yet fully formed and who struggle to cope with the infection.'Among that group who are previously well ... It's not just a chest infection, some of these children can be impacted with the flu affecting the heart and the brain,' Dr Britton told The Daily Telegraph.A warning was sounded about RSV three weeks ago when there were just 355 cases a week in NSW,Around a fifth of those developed the potentially lethal bronchiolitis, with 40 per cent of them ending up in hospital.Infectious disease researcher Dr John-Sebastian Eden said the triple whammy of RSV, flu and Covid was packing out the emergency department of Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital.'There is a widespread three-way outbreak occurring,' he told Daily Mail Australia.International borders opening up has seen flu come back and new strains of RSV.'With Covid layered up on top, these are three main viruses which will lead to hospitalisationDuring Covid, RSV continued to spread and split into two separate strains in the east and west of the country in the wake of Western Australia's prolonged isolation. Researchers were shocked by the sudden rise of the disease in the first year of lockdowns, fuelled by keeping childcare centres open despite Covid restrictions.'It was something we had never seen before,' said Dr Eden. 'Even in lockdown there was a lot of effort to keep childcare open.'You only need a small amount of virus to build up a chain of transmission.'Dr Eden believes cases in NSW have yet to reach their peak, but is now braced for the outbreak to spread nationwide. He expects the disease to spread across the southern half of the country at similar levels in the coming weeks.'What happens is where you have an outbreak in NSW and we've got all those people travelling to other states from there, it then feeds outbreaks in other parts,' he said.The disease subsided in 2021, but has now bounced back with the current outbreak."

        "© The Expose\n\nA report that was quietly published by the UK Government, just hours before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation, reveals that Covid-19 deaths have risen dramatically among the triple vaccinated population in England over the past couple of months whilst declining drastically among the unvaccinated population.With the most recent figures showing the vaccinated population in England accounted for a shocking 94% of all Covid-19 Deaths in April and May, and 90% of those deaths were among the triple/quadruple vaccinated population.On the 7th July, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced he was resigning.It's times like these that you ought to watch what bad news is being quietly published in the background in the hope that it won't receive much attention, and it just so happens that hours before Boris announced his resignation, his Government published new data that proves things have been terrible for the vaccinated population in England over the past couple of months.Back in March 2022, the UK Health Security Agency announced that from April 1st 2022, they would no longer publish the vaccination status of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in England.At the time, the UKHSA claimed this was because the UK Government had ended free universal Covid-19 testing and this therefore affected their \"ability to robustly monitor Covid-19 cases by vaccination status\".However, this was a lie.The following chart shows the real world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England in the Week 3 Week 7 and Week 13 UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 -This was nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by Pfizer was it?But now we have more evidence to both prove the UKHSA was lying, and that the current mainstream media storm surrounding the resignation of Boris Johnson is just a distraction.This is because another UK Government agency, known as the Office for National Statistics (ONS), has just published data on deaths by vaccination status.The latest dataset from the ONS is titled ' Deaths by Vaccination Status, England, 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022 ', and it can be accessed on the ONS site here , and downloaded here Table 1 of the latest data set contains figures on the mortality rates by vaccination status for all cause deaths, deaths involving Covid-19, and deaths not involving Covid-19. And it is here that we are able to ascertain the vaccination status of everyone who has died of Covid-19 since the beginning of April 2022, when the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably report the figures.Here's how the ONS presents the figures for the month of April 2022 -We've taken the figures provided by the ONS for both April and May 2022, and produced the following chart showing Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022In March 2022, there were 321 Covid-19 deaths within 60 days of a positive test among the unvaccinated population according to the UKHSA Week 13 Vaccine Surveillance Report, as detailed in the following chart using data extracted from table 13b of the report -This means there were 33 less deaths among the unvaccinated over two months (April and May) than there were in the whole of March.Unfortunately, the opposite is true for the vaccinated population, especially the triple vaccinated.This means deaths have fallen drastically among the unvaccinated but increased significantly among the vaccinated population since the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably publish the data.The following chart shows the percentage of Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022, according to the latest ONS dataset published just hours before Boris Johnson's resignation -The quietly published figures reveal that the vaccinated population as a whole accounted for a shocking 94% of all Covid-19 deaths in April and May 2022, with the unvaccinated accounting for just 6% of all Covid-19 deaths.However, many in the UK have been given a fourth dose of a Covid-19 injection since the spring, and judging by the latest data from the Government of Cananda, it's likely many of those deaths could actually be among the quadruple vaccinated.The most recent Government of Canada figures show that there were 521 Covid-19 deaths between 6th and 12th June, and the vaccinated population accounted for 485 of them, with a shocking 242 deaths among the quadruple vaccinated population, meaning they accounted for 50% of Covid-19 deaths among the vaccinated in the second week of June 2022.These aren't the kind of figures you would expect to see if the Covid-19 injections really are up to 95% effective at preventing death, are they?So there you have it, whilst you've been distracted by Boris Johnson's resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the UK Government quietly published a report just hours before his announcement containing data they previously claimed they didn't have, which confirmed the vaccinated now account for 94% of Covid-19 deaths in England, and 90% of those deaths are among the triple vaccinated.With news like this being swept under the rug by the mainstream media, it makes you wonder what else they will attempt to hide in the coming weeks?"

        "© Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nNew York researchers transplanted pig hearts into two brain-dead people over the last month, the latest in a string of developments in the long quest to one day save human lives with animal organs.The experiments announced Tuesday come after a historic but failed attempt earlier this year to use a pig's heart to save a dying Maryland man — sort of a rehearsal before scientists try again in the living.Among the lessons: Practice with the deceased is important.They used special new methods to check for any worrisome animal viruses before sewing the heart into the chest of each deceased recipient — a Vietnam veteran from Pennsylvania with a long history of heart disease and a New York woman who'd benefited from a transplant earlier in life.Already the Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to allow a small number of Americans who need a new organ to volunteer for rigorous studies of either pig hearts or kidneys. NYU Langone is among three transplant centers planning trials — and has a meeting planned with the FDA in August to discuss requirements.Animal-to-human transplants, what scientists call xenotransplantation, have been tried for decades without success, as people's immune systems almost instantly attacked the foreign tissue.The most ambitious attempt so far came in January, when doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center transplanted a pig heart into a dying 57-year-old. David Bennett survived for two months, evidence that xenotransplantation was at least possible. But initial testing missed that the organ harbored an animal virus. What caused Bennett's new heart to fail and whether that virus played any role still isn't known, the Maryland researchers recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.Months earlier, the NYU team and researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham separately were testing pig kidney transplants in the deceased, people who'd donated their bodies for science.\"This is not a one-and-done situation. This is going to be years of learning what's important and what's not important for this to work,\" said Montgomery, who has a list of almost 50 people who've called desperate to volunteer for a pig kidney transplant.The FDA hasn't signaled how soon it might decide whether to allow such studies. At a recent two-day public meeting, the agency's scientific advisers said it was time to try despite a long list of questions. They include how best to modify the pigs, as several biotech companies — including Revivicor, which supplied the NYU organs — are pursuing different options.It's not even clear which organ to attempt first in a clinical trial. If a pig kidney fails, the patient can always survive on dialysis. Yet some of the FDA's advisers said starting with the heart might be better. Experiments with pig kidneys in deceased humans showed the organs produced urine. But still unknown is whether pig kidneys do another important job — processing medications — the same way human kidneys do."

After opening a small restaurant they sold it to buy a ranch with a peanut plantation and to have their only beloved son study.\n\nFrom Siderno, a stronghold of the ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria, they did not bring with them any suspicions of the mafia, but only the dialect with which Leon spoke to his cousin Domenico Panetta, twice Mayor of Siderno, when he went to visit him at the White House. The latter did not hesitate to make a great media fuss when his relative first became Bill Clinton’s Chief Cabinet (1994-1997) and then director of the Central Intelligence Agency (2009-2011), the American counter-espionage, thanks to the will of Barack Obama.\n\nLeon Panetta was in fact the head of the most powerful secret service in the world in the years in which Obama wanted to relaunch the “National Center for Disease Control and Public Health” founded in 1937 in Tbilisi, opened by the former Soviet Union to fight dangerous pathogens, which in 2011 was named after Senator Richard Lugar and in 2013 was equipped with a BSL-3 laboratory.\n\nWhile it was he himself, as Secretary of the Department of Defense / Pentagon (2011-February 2013), who financed the opening of the 11 bacteriological laboratories in Ukraine in 2012, which ended up in the eye of the storm for reports of dangerous virus experiments denounced by the Kremlin, after the starting of the military operation (February 2022) for the protection of the pro-Russians of the Donbass and the de-Nazification of the paramilitaries of the Kiev army.\n\n1 – PANETTA, SPEARHEAD OF OBAMA AND DEEP STATE\n\nIf any shadow has fallen on his cousin for his youthful intemperance and for the political error of having favored a center-left agreement in 2015 for the election of a Mayor of Siderno then lapsed when the City Council was dissolved for the mafia in 2018 (the former senator Pietro Fuda is now indicted before the Criminal Court of Locri with the accusation of external complicity in mafia association), on his powerful relative of America there is only the suspicion that he is one of the spearheads of the New World Order, more commonly called Deep State in the US.\n\nThe existence of the Deep State, a potentate of Freemasons, mostly Zionist financiers, intelligence officials and military officers, was publicly confirmed by CIA Director John Brennan, Panetta’s successor in the post, on the occasion of the impeachment against President Donald Trump on UkraineGate.\n\nIn fact, Mister Leon had the merit of maintaining excellent relations with the Republicans after converting to the Democratic Party in time to avoid the WaterGate cyclone that overwhelmed President Richard Nixon, in whose staff he had worked before colliding over civil rights in the Southern states, where the republican statesman wanted to prioritize education for whites. One could almost suspect that it was he who lit the fuse of the scandal, but that’s another story…\n\nHis bi-partisan credibility was evident at the moment of his confirmation as Obama’s Secretary of Defense: the Senate ruled with a plebiscite of 100 votes in favor and none against. No wonder too much though …\n\nBecause Panetta was the CIA director who identified and killed Osama bin Laden on May 1st, 2011. If we are to believe the official sources and avoid doubting the elimination of the Al Qaeda sheik.\n\nBut his recent interviews about Russia’s likely defeat in Ukraine lead us to fear that at the age of 74 he has lost his former clarity or has a nagging fear that the Moscow military might find some compromising x-file on the bacteriological activities carried out in that country by the Pentagon, despite the Kiev government’s order to destroy all documents which anticipated the World Health Organization’s suggestion to eliminate any viral strains stored in research centers.\n\nJust Panetta, if one day he wanted to break the secret that goes well with the conspiratorial tradition of his Calabrian blood, he could certainly tell many things about coronaviruses and Obama’s obsession with these “ancestors” of SARS-Cov-2, built in the laboratory in “a deal between China and the US”. As reported by the late French virologist Luc Montagnier, as demonstrated by Gospa News in 52 investigations of the WuhanGates cycle (49 already translated in English).\n\nEspecially since his story intersects perfectly in a political and financial intrigue that appears to be the perfect narrative of the New World Order conspiracy on the Covid-19 pandemic and on those that are looming on the horizon, such as monkeypox.\n\n2 – YOUNG SON OF CALABRIANS IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE\n\nLeon Edward was born on June 28, 1938, in Monterey, California, son of Carmelina Maria (Prochilo) and Carmelo Frank Panetta, Italian immigrants from Siderno in Calabria, Italy. In the 1940s, the Panetta family owned a restaurant in Monterey. He grew up in the Monterey area and attended two Catholic high schools: the San Carlos School (Monterey) and the Junípero Serra School (Carmel). He attended Monterey High School, a public school where he was involved in student politics and was a member of the Junior Statesmen of America.\n\nAs a young man, he was vice president of the student body and as a senior he became president. In 1956 he entered Santa Clara University, California, and graduated magna cum laude in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. In 1963 he graduated in law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Santa Clara.\n\nAt just 26 years old, soon graduated, and he has his first experience in secret services. In 1964 he enlisted in the United States Army as a second lieutenant, where he served as an officer in the Army Military Intelligence and received the Medal of Commendation. In 1966 he was discharged from office as First Lieutenant.\n\nAfter doing a bit of political apprenticeship in 1969 he became assistant to Robert H. Finch, Secretary of Health in the Nixon administration and, in the same year, at only 31 years old, he was appointed Director of the Civil Rights Office. He leaves Washington to work as an assistant to the future Mayor of New York, Republican John Lindsay whose turn he follows when he becomes a Democrat. After working as a lawyer (1971-1970) in 1977 he entered the Chamber as a deputy at the age of 39.\n\nLet’s jump back in time and arrive at the years of Bill Clinton’s administration with a very eloquent and fundamental photo to understand Panetta’s career, the financial intrigues between Italy and the US under the sign of the Democrats, and the subsequent global immunization plan connected to the pandemic that coronavirus research in Ukraine has certainly facilitated…\n\nWe weren’t able to find the exact date of the photo but it dates back to a period between 1994 and 1997 when Panetta was President Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff and Anthony Lake was National Security Advisor to the White House.\n\nWe are in the period of the War in the Balkans when the US legitimized the use of Al Qaeda in Bosnia in an operation managed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which according to the American parliamentarian Ilhan Omar founded Al Qaeda thanks to a family friendship with Osama Bin Laden, and by the CIA to interrupt the influence in the countries of the former Yugoslavia of Russia (which in the meantime had however opened to the Perestrjka, restructuring, of Michael Gorbachev).\n\nIn those years in Belgrade the American counter-espionage financed the birth of the Otpor Center (Closed Fist) together with the Hungarian-American Plutarch George Soros who allowed the Serbian leaders to then found the “anti-violence center” Canvas, actually an expert in urban warfare, and start the Color Revolutions around the world. In Serbia there was a starter of the strategy of the attempted coup in Caracas (2002), when some Colombian snipers, in full knowledge of the CIA, fired into the crowd as Georgian mercenaries did in 2014 in Kiev, paving the way for the coup of NATO countries from which has resulted in the current war.\n\nIn those years, moreover, the CIA favored in Bosnia the birth of the Caliphate of Europe, so named in the homonymous historical novel by an Italian deputy commissioner of the State Police, then aggregated to Interpol in Jordan and now retired.\n\nBut let’s focus on the very important figure of Lake that Clinton in 1996 tried to appoint as director of the CIA, but he got the rejection due to the vote against the Republican senators.\n\nLake had to settle for becoming a National Security Advisor and then saw the hope of becoming Secretary of State vanish when Obama appointed Hillary Clinton, who was defeated in the Democratic primary. Thanks to Obama’s candidacy, however, in 2010 he was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as director of UNICEF.\n\nAnd this is where the first intrigue begins under the sign of the Democrats. It was during his leadership that 3.9 million euros rained from the United Nations International Emergency Fund for Children to the unknown company Play Therapy Africa limited, run by a relative of the former Democratic Party secretary, Matteo Renzi.\n\nPart of this money ended up, instead of in projects for African children, on the accounts of the politician’s relatives and in the company of the family of the former Prime Minister, unrelated to any crime dispute, which at the time of his inauguration in February 2014 was celebrated for this appointment by Obama with his trip to Italy.\n\nThat visit was probably made by the American president also to talk about the global immunization plan wanted by Bill Gates, one of the first megadonor of the Democratic Party and in particular of the former Illinois senator who made a rapid political career for his “nose” in the field of biological weapons … This link forces us to the first flash-back.\n\n3 – 2004, THE BEGINNING OF THE ORWELLIAN PLAN: WUHAN-CIA\n\n2004 is the year of the official beginning of the plot of the New World Order on pandemics from contagious viruses built in the laboratory (also to be treatable and not kill the same directors of the criminal plan). As we revealed in the WuhanGates 9 investigation, the Italian economist and politician Romano Prodi is president of the European Commission which finances a project worth almost 2 million euros to carry out bacteriological experiments on the SARS epidemic (acronym in English for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). More bio-weapons experts as early as 2003 believe it to be a laboratory-built pathogen, but even less than today no one pays attention to it.\n\nThose who come too close to the truth, however, do not have time to publish dossiers: as happened to the Italian virologist Carlo Urbani, then killed by the virus-like my dear friend biologist Franco Trinca who was investigating SARS-Cov-2 and the presence of graphene in anti-Covid gene sera.\n\nIt will be up to Dr. David E. Martin in his The FauciDossier, the credit to demonstrate why SARS 2003 was also in all likelihood built in the laboratory, as we wrote in WuhanGates 40.\n\nProdi, a great friend of Soros, is the exponent of the radical chic left who in Italy began to rage in 1992: since the so-called “red magistrates” eliminated the Socialist Party and the right of the Christian Democrats to give way to the left DC to ally with the moderate fringes of the PCI and building various center-left movements culminating in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Italy, the PD will only be born in 2007 but in 2004 the European Democratic Party was born in Brussels, among whose founders there is Francesco Rutelli, “pardoned” by the judiciary in the scandal of an shortfall of 25 million euros in his previous one-party La Margherita.\n\nIn Italy, Rutelli becomes the vice president of the Council with Prodi Premier after the 2006 elections but above all, he becomes the mentor of the young President of the Province of Florence Matteo Renzi and puts him in contact with the United States of America and with .. the CIA!\n\nIn 2006, in fact, the journalist, consultant of the White House, and agent of the secret services Michael Ledeen, was hosted at a conference organized by the Province of Florence, as shown by the invoices for his hospitality.\n\nA year later Renzi receives in Italy Hillary Clinton, who entered politics after her husband’s red-light scandal in the Lewinsky case, which the Chief of Cabinet Leon Panetta tried in vain to minimize. Today in the EDP, just as well, there is only the new political movement Italia Viva founded by Renzi, after his brief period as premier (2014-2016).\n\nThus we arrive at the American presidential elections of 2008 when the outsider Barack Obama becomes the first African-American president in the history of the USA. “Too powerful Hillary Clinton”, the puppeteers of the New World Order must have thought, better to win those who have no deep ties with the Deep State Zionist of the Weapons Lobby (BlackRock by Larry Fink and Elliott by Paul Singer). And so Obama loses the primary votes by a number of votes but the delegates subvert the results in his favor, giving him the nomination and victory in the race for the White House.\n\n4 – GATES IMMUNIZATION PLAN AND CORONAVIRUS HUNTING\n\nThe Obama-Biden couple triumphs in the presidential elections also thanks to funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which immediately afterward hurries the White House on the global immunization plan. The PREDICT project was thus launched with the support of the EcoHealthAlliance of the Anglo-American zoologist Peter Daszak, among the first, in February 2020, to try to hide the SARS-Cov-2 hypothesis with colleagues from The Lancet magazine (funded by Gates) and then with scientists from the WHO task force sent to Wuhan.\n\nEHA is in turn financed by Bill Gates’ Gavi Alliance which, during the first SARS epidemic of 2003, was directed by Jen Stoltenberg, later destined to become NATO Secretary and to blow up the Ukraine blast; he will soon be able to enjoy the New World Order award as from September he will become president of Norge Bank, a major investor in the Weapons Lobby corporations and in the Big Pharma cartel.\n\nPREDICT, a project of USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, was initiated in 2009 to strengthen global capacity for the detection and discovery of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. Those include coronaviruses, the family to which SARS and MERS belong; paramyxoviruses, like Nipahvirus; influenza viruses; and filoviruses, like the ebola virus. PREDICT has made significant contributions to strengthening global surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capabilities for new and known viruses» reads the presentation made by USAID, United States Agency for International Development.\n\nUSAID is a government body sadly known for having become the financial instrument of the Central Intelligence Agency in the international operations of “exporting Democracy”, in the jargon of military intelligence it is called “regime-change” while in that of social historiography they have been called “Springs Arabs ”in the Middle East or Color Revolutions in the West.\n\nThrough these efforts, PREDICT will improve global disease recognition and begin to develop strategies and policy recommendations to minimize pandemic risk\n\nJudging by the millions of deaths caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, also due to effective home care ignored as denounced to the judiciary by the Italian biologist Franco Trinca, and by the economic devastation caused by the social dictatorship in the West, we can say that PREDICT was a total failure from a health point of view. But it was a resounding success from a political point of view!\n\nIn practice, with the advent of Obama and Biden in the White House, the Chinese laboratory, promoted and managed by the Academy of Sciences under the aegis of the powerful Shanghai Gang of former president Jiang Zemin, known as the Tiananmen executioner for having sent the tanks against the students, it passed from the control of the European Commission to that of Washington and the CIA. This is why the late French virologist Luc Montagnier defined SARS-Cov-2 as a bacteriological weapon resulting from “an affair between China and the US” or, more precisely as evidenced by Gospa News, between the Shanghai Communist Gang and the Democrats Americans Clinton-Obama.\n\nThis is why Leon Edward Panetta when he arrived at the CIA in 2009 was probably well aware of the experiments on coronaviruses and SARS strains conducted in the 28 civil and military bacteriological laboratories in the United States of America but was certainly aware of those carried out in the 25 bacteriological laboratories managed by the Pentagon / through the DTRA agency) in various countries of the world (according to China, there are as many as 300 foreign research centers of the US Department of Defense).\n\n5 – PANETTA: FROM THE CIA TO THE PENTAGON IN THE AGE OF CHIMERIC VIRUSES\n\nPREDICT is led by the UC Davis One Health Institute and core partners include USAID, EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota, Wildlife Conservation Society, and Smithsonian Institution. But among the partners there are also the WHO and the Wuhan Institute of Virology which has had a fundamental part in research and dangerous experiments on viruses. Together with them there are also as Global Partner EPT One Health Workforce, EPT Preparedness & Response, FAO, CDC, Columbia University, HealthMap, UC San Francisco and in particular DTRA (Defense Threat Reduction Agency) which operates under the supervision of the Pentagon but also of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nAs part of this global project, PREEMPT research has been launched which aims to predict the emergence of highly pathogenic viruses in animals and thus prevent them from completely spilling onto humans using strategies that include a new animal vaccine.\n\nLed by the One Health Institute in the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and the Center for Comparative Medicine in the UC Davis schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, this research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of its Preventing Emerging Pathogenic Threats (PREEMPT) program.\n\nTherefore it is a Pentagon initiative that can be seen in a Dual Use objective with defense purposes in the search for a vaccine or attack for the development of a bacteriological weapon. Let’s not forget that the first biological warfare exercise of the US Navy dates back to 1952 as confirmed by a declassified video published exclusively by Gospa News.\n\nKherson Oblast Laboratory\n\nRegistration card #2225-04 dated 21.05.2012.

        "One of the themes of this week’s False Flag Weekly News is “follow the money.” My Georgia Guidestones satire, for example, plays on the eerie similarity of the Guidestones “explosions and demolition” images and the more grandiose “explosions and demolition” images from 9/11.* Could Larry Silverstein, the notorious overinsured World Trade Center landlord who made a fortune on the demolition of his own buildings, be up to his old tricks?\n\nProbably not. But it’s an amusing thought.\n\nAs I recall, Larry Silverstein wound up with a 9/11 insurance settlement of less than $5 billion, which was considerably less than what he asked for—and even more considerably less than what is at stake in the various scenarios under which the US would pay reparations for the crimes of its national security state, including (but not limited to) the war crimes stemming from the 9/11 false flag."

        "https://twitter.com/WEIWEIDAI4/status/1408274396792324096\n\nVT’s overall poor relationship with the Trump presidency has moved up a notch. The report Trump is referencing went, not unnoticed, but rather totally censored in the Western press, as has so much else until VT sought out the facts and published them.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DailyMail/status/1407741751603957768\n\nUS Congress is seeking a probe into the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan, as alleged COVID-19 'super-spreader'.#VoiceOfNations pic.twitter.com/51mYGS4aDJ — Voice of Nations (@VoiceOfNations7) June 24, 2021\n\nIf America proves that the Wuhan Games were a super spreader event – Trudeau and Xi Jinping are in some serious shit. https://t.co/8Nt21XnwPv — Keean Bexte (@TheRealKeean) June 24, 2021\n\nNow, for the second time, Trump has made sad and silly denials, this one filled with hyperbole and grandiose behavior, typical of a spectrum sociopath.\n\nMarch 12, 2020: In October 2019, the US brought 172 (really 369) military athletes to Wuhan for the World Military Games. Despite having the largest military in the world, tenfold, the US came in 35th behind nations like Iran, Finland and Slovenia. No video or photos exist of the US team, no records were kept, a huge team but a pitiful performance for the best military in the world.\n\nThe US team did so badly that they were called “Soy Sauce Soldiers” by the Chinese. In fact, many never participated in any event and stayed near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the disease is said to have originated only days after the US left the area.\n\n“You look at how the US team performed in the 2019 Military Games, and you think about the overall economic situation in America, and you wonder how long the US can continue on its current path when the economies debt is at an unprecedented rate”, stated Ben Tejes, Co-Founder and CEO of Ascend Finance, which created a Chapter 7 means test calculator to help people understand their debt relief options such as bankruptcy.\n\nThe US team went home on October 28, 2019, and within 2 weeks, the first human contact cases of COVID 19 were seen in Wuhan. The Chinese have not been able to find “patient zero” and believe he was a member of the US team.\n\nThey also have sources that say the US had misrepresented influenza that Trump claims have killed thousands, influenza carried to China by the US team, influenza that was really COVID 19, a disease developed in a military bio-warfare facility in the state of Washington, now “ground zero” in the US for COVID 19.\n\nThe Chinese claim, something censored in the US, that the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below average results of American athletes in the game indicates they might have been in for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives, and that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.[28][29]\n\nRT/Moscow: The US army might have brought the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to China’s Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected in the country, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.\n\n“When did patient zero begin in the US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be the US army that brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! The US owes us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao has demanded US authorities reveal what they’re hiding about the origins of Covid-19, going as far as to suggest the coronavirus may have been brought to China by the US military.\n\nPointing to a video of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield apparently admitting the US had several deaths from Covid-19 before they were able to test for it, Zhao called on the American watchdog to come clean in a tweet posted on Thursday.\n\n2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020\n\n“It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao suggested, calling for the CDC – and the US in general – to “be transparent” and share what they know about where and when “Patient Zero” was first diagnosed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/twainus/status/1238131011503951872\n\nIn the video, Redfield acknowledged that some cases of coronavirus were misclassified as influenza as the medics did not have an accurate test for the new epidemic at the time. He did not elaborate on when these misdiagnosed cases first appeared – saying only that “some cases have been diagnosed that way.”\n\nCDC director openly admitting that some #covid deaths have been misdiagnosed as influenza in the US. The question is when are those deaths. This supports the claims made by Japanese scientists that the virus originated from the US but was covered up.#COVID19 #Corona pic.twitter.com/AwdXAKz6Ao — Taro (@taro_taylor) March 12, 2020\n\nIn the absence of any patients’ details or chronology of deaths, speculation has swirled. Zhao’s “theory” in particular focused on the military delegation that traveled to Wuhan in October for the Military World Games, weeks before the city confirmed the outbreak in December. The delegation was part of the 300-member group of American athletes taking part in the multi-sport event held every four years.\n\nThe #Bahrain Interior Minister accused Iran of spreading #COVID19 & biological warfare. I respond to him that the #USA with its 5th fleet governing Bahrain is the main factor behind #BiologicalWarfare and even initial hiding #CoronavirusOutbreak in America. pic.twitter.com/f7TqbqFoOA — H.Amirabdollahian امیرعبداللهیان (@Amirabdolahian) March 12, 2020\n\n\n\nZhao is not the only high-profile political figure to voice suspicions about the timing of the Games and the introduction of the coronavirus in Wuhan. Former Malaysian PM Matthias Chang offered similar speculation back in January, zeroing in on the event as the launch point for what he deemed a biological war waged by the US against China.\n\nWe are still figuring out where the virus originated. And chances are high that the virus was brought to China by the US army team who visited Wuhan in October. Anyway, no human deserves COVID-19. The world should fight against the disease together. No time for blame. — Chris Jiang (@crs_1222) February 27, 2020\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that what is now the Covid-19 pandemic was first reported as a coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. The search for the deadly disease’s origin has been ongoing, with conflicting versions blaming the Wuhan food market and bats – a local delicacy – sold there in particular, while others opined humans might have gotten the virus from pangolins, an endangered scaly mammal.\n\nLess orthodox theories suggest malicious intent, with the head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards sensationally claiming last week that Covid-19 could possibly be “a product of a biological attack by America which initially spread to China and then to Iran and the rest of the world.”\n\nSo far, the problem with all of those theories, blaming both animals and humans, is that no direct causal proof has been established, while the identity of China’s “patient zero” also remains unclear. And it’s not China alone: in Washington state – which seemingly identified and successfully isolated its first infected traveler, with dozens of contacts identified and monitored – the virus somehow began spreading anyway. Even Steve Wozniak, Apple’s co-founder, at one point claimed he and his wife may have been the US’ “patient zero” after developing a bad cough on return from China. It has since emerged his wife’s diagnosis was “a sinus infection,” however.\n\nWhy does the plague in Wuhan depend on the PLA?\n\n2020-01-30 17:01:10 Source: school coffee house Author: fish off the deep\n\nViews: 37708 Comments: 24 (view) From October 18 to October 27, 2019, the World Military Games was held in Wuhan, and the United States sent 369 soy sauce soldiers to participate. Why is it soy sauce soldiers? Because in the 10-day game, the performance of the American soy sauce soldiers was so disappointing that even Bahrain was unnecessarily disappointed, the gold medal was even missing, and the overall score was left far behind by North Korea, which once gave Mexico a chance. The urge to counterattack the continental United States. However, the poor performance in the game did not affect the mood of the soy sauce soldiers playing in Wuhan. They teamed up in groups of two, and played around the streets of Wuhan, leaving many romantic accidents. It should be pointed out that the location of the US guest house of the Military Games is not far from South China Seafood City. At the end of the military games, just when people were wondering, how could these gangsters who can’t wait to build muscles on their faces suddenly get fired up? Did the American soldiers ’food only be grappled? Or did they forget to eat it during the game?

Then the authors claimed that after the advent of the SARS virus (2002-2003) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), scientists were aware of the risk of interspecific transmission that would lead to an epidemic among people.\n\nSuccessful lab experiment\n\nAmong other things, the research team studied bats, which are the largest incubators of coronaviruses. Nevertheless, bats could not transmit the coronavirus to humans because they could not interact with human cells with ACE2 receptors.\n\nThe material also stated that horseshoe bats carry a strain of SARS coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans. It has been named the SHC014-CoV virus.\n\nTo better study this virus, scientists copied the coronavirus and infected it with laboratory mice. The results showed that the virus is really able to bind to human cells with ACE2 receptors and multiply in the cells of the respiratory system.\n\nIn the research work, it is noted that laboratory materials, samples and equipment that were used in the research were obtained from the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Although it is not yet possible to say for sure that the virus that was tested in laboratory mice is the same as the SARS-Cove-2 coronavirus.\n\nNATO policy\n\nHowever, interesting things can be found in earlier documents.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe 2019 Alliance’s activity report says that in 2019, the Alliance’s first place in research and development was occupied by the topic of radiochemical and biological protection (29%), shifting the seemingly most pressing problem of Europe – counterterrorism (it turned out to be 4- m priority).\n\nA year earlier, in 2018, the situation was exactly the opposite: terrorism, as it should be, was in the first place (28%), and radiochemical and biological protection in the fourth (13%).\n\nAs the Brussels snitch writes in the telegram channel, “given the absence of visible reasons for such a sharp change in scientific interests, there are two options and both are unpleasant:\n\nor NATO now wags the fifth point, falsifying the data to show “and we always prepared for viruses, we are modern”,\n\nor even in 2019 in the alliance, God forgive me, they knew where the trouble would come from.\n\nYes, the first option is much more real, but, you see, the facts are surprising.\n\nSource: Pravda\n\nOriginal 2015 Research Unedited and Complete\n\nPublished: 09 November 2015 A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence by Vineet D Menachery, Boyd L Yount Jr, Kari Debbink, Sudhakar Agnihothram, Lisa E Gralinski, Jessica A Plante, Rachel L Graham, Trevor Scobey, Xing-Yi Ge, Eric F Donaldson, Scott H Randell, Antonio Lanzavecchia, Wayne A Marasco, Zhengli-Li Shi, Ralph S Baric\n\nNature Medicine volume 21, pages 1508–1513 (2015)\n\nA Corrigendum to this article was published on 06 April 2016\n\nThis article has been updated\n\nAbstract\n\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations1. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system2, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.\n\nThe results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.\n\nEvaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approach failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.\n\nMain\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV heralded a new era in the cross-species transmission of severe respiratory illness with globalization leading to rapid spread around the world and massive economic impact3,4. Since then, several strains—including influenza A strains H5N1, H1N1 and H7N9, and MERS-CoV—have emerged from animal populations, causing considerable disease, mortality and economic hardship for the afflicted regions5. Although public health measures were able to stop the SARS-CoV outbreak4, recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat1,6.\n\nHowever, sequence data alone provides minimal insights to identify and prepare for future pre-pandemic viruses. Therefore, to examine the emergence potential (that is, the potential to infect humans) of circulating bat CoVs, we built a chimeric virus encoding a novel, zoonotic CoV spike protein—from the RsSHC014-CoV sequence that was isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats1—in the context of the SARS-CoV mouse-adapted backbone. The hybrid virus allowed us to evaluate the ability of the novel spike protein to cause disease independently of other necessary adaptive mutations in its natural backbone.\n\nUsing this approach, we characterized CoV infection mediated by the SHC014 spike protein in primary human airway cells and in vivo and tested the efficacy of available immune therapeutics against SHC014-CoV. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.\n\nThe sequences of SHC014 and the related RsWIV1-CoV show that these CoVs are the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains (Fig. 1a,b); however, there are important differences in the 14 residues that bind human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, including the five that are critical for host range: Y442, L472, N479, T487 and Y491 (ref. 7).\n\nIn WIV1, three of these residues vary from the epidemic SARS-CoV Urbani strain, but they were not expected to alter binding to ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). This fact is confirmed by both pseudotyping experiments that measured the ability of lentiviruses encoding WIV1 spike proteins to enter cells expressing human ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and by in vitro replication assays of WIV1-CoV (ref. 1). In contrast, 7 of 14 ACE2-interaction residues in SHC014 are different from those in SARS-CoV, including all five residues critical for the host range (Supplementary Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nThese changes, coupled with the failure of pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the SHC014 spike to enter cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggested that the SHC014 spike is unable to bind human ACE2. However, similar changes in related SARS-CoV strains had been reported to allow ACE2 binding7,8, suggesting that additional functional testing was required for verification.\n\nTherefore, we synthesized the SHC014 spike in the context of the replication-competent, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone (we hereafter refer to the chimeric CoV as SHC014-MA15) to maximize the opportunity for pathogenesis and vaccine studies in mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Despite predictions from both structure-based modeling and pseudotyping experiments, SHC014-MA15 was viable and replicated to high titers in Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Similar to SARS, SHC014-MA15 also required a functional ACE2 molecule for entry and could use human, civet and bat ACE2 orthologs (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).\n\nTo test the ability of the SHC014 spike to mediate infection of the human airway, we examined the sensitivity of the human epithelial airway cell line Calu-3 2B4 (ref. 9) to infection and found robust SHC014-MA15 replication, comparable to that of SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 1c).\n\nTo extend these findings, primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures were infected and showed robust replication of both viruses (Fig. 1d). Together, the data confirm the ability of viruses with the SHC014 spike to infect human airway cells and underscore the potential threat of cross-species transmission of SHC014-CoV.\n\nFigure 1: SARS-like viruses replicate in human airway cells and produce in vivo pathogenesis.\n\n(a) The full-length genome sequences of representative CoVs were aligned and phylogenetically mapped as described in the Online Methods. The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions, with only bootstrap support above 70% being labeled. The tree shows CoVs divided into three distinct phylogenetic groups, defined as α-CoVs, β-CoVs and γ-CoVs. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d for the β-CoVs and as 1a and 1b for the α-CoVs. (b) Amino acid sequences of the S1 domains of the spikes of representative β-CoVs of the 2b group, including SARS-CoV, were aligned and phylogenetically mapped. The scale bar represents the amino acid substitutions.

Samples were collected at individual time points with biological replicates (n = 3) for both Calu-3 and HAE experiments.

For each graph, the center value represents the group mean, and the error bars define the s.e.m. Scale bars, 1 mm.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo evaluate the role of the SHC014 spike in mediating infection in vivo, we infected 10-week-old BALB/c mice with 104 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of either SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1e–h). Animals infected with SARS-MA15 experienced rapid weight loss and lethality by 4 d post-infection (d.p.i.); in contrast, SHC014-MA15 infection produced substantial weight loss (10%) but no lethality in mice (Fig. 1e). Examination of viral replication revealed nearly equivalent viral titers from the lungs of mice infected with SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1f). Whereas lungs from the SARS-MA15–infected mice showed robust staining in both the terminal bronchioles and the lung parenchyma 2 d.p.i. (Fig. 1g), those of SHC014-MA15–infected mice showed reduced airway antigen staining (Fig. 1h); in contrast, no deficit in antigen staining was observed in the parenchyma or in the overall histology scoring, suggesting differential infection of lung tissue for SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nWe next analyzed infection in more susceptible, aged (12-month-old) animals. SARS-MA15–infected animals rapidly lost weight and succumbed to infection (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). SHC014-MA15 infection-induced robust and sustained weight loss, but had minimal lethality. Trends in the histology and antigen staining patterns that we observed in young mice were conserved in the older animals (Supplementary Table 3). We excluded the possibility that SHC014-MA15 was mediating infection through an alternative receptor on the basis of experiments using Ace2−/− mice, which did not show weight loss or antigen staining after SHC014-MA15 infection (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 2). Together, the data indicate that viruses with the SHC014 spike are capable of inducing weight loss in mice in the context of a virulent CoV backbone.\n\nGiven the preclinical efficacy of Ebola monoclonal antibody therapies, such as ZMApp10, we next sought to determine the efficacy of SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies against infection with SHC014-MA15. Four broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV spike protein had been previously reported and are probable reagents for immunotherapy11,12,13. We examined the effect of these antibodies on viral replication (expressed as percentage inhibition of viral replication) and found that whereas wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani was strongly neutralized by all four antibodies at relatively low antibody concentrations (Fig. 2a–d), neutralization varied for SHC014-MA15. Fm6, an antibody generated by phage display and escape mutants11,12, achieved only background levels of inhibition of SHC014-MA15 replication (Fig. 2a). Similarly, antibodies 230.15 and 227.14, which were derived from memory B cells of SARS-CoV–infected patients13, also failed to block SHC014-MA15 replication (Fig. 2b,c). For all three antibodies, differences between the SARS and SHC014 spike amino acid sequences corresponded to direct or adjacent residue changes found in SARS-CoV escape mutants (fm6 N479R; 230.15 L443V; 227.14 K390Q/E), which probably explains the absence of the antibodies’ neutralizing activity against SHC014. Finally, monoclonal antibody 109.8 was able to achieve 50% neutralization of SHC014-MA15, but only at high concentrations (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 2d). Together, the results demonstrate that broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV may only have marginal efficacy against emergent SARS-like CoV strains such as SHC014.\n\nFigure 2: SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies have marginal efficacy against SARS-like CoVs.\n\n(a–d) Neutralization assays evaluating efficacy (measured as a reduction in the number of plaques) of a panel of monoclonal antibodies, which were all originally generated against epidemic SARS-CoV, against infection of Vero cells with SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-MA15 (green). The antibodies tested were fm6 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 5 for SHC014-MA15)11,12 (a), 230.15 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 2 for SHC014-MA15) (b), 227.15 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) (c) and 109.8 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 2 for SHC014-MA15)13 (d). Each data point represents the group mean and error bars define the s.e.m. Note that the error bars in SARS-CoV Urbani–infected Vero cells in b,c are overlapped by the symbols and are not visible.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous groups 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c).\n\nNotably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.\n\nIn contrast to the vaccination of mice with DIV, the use of SHC014-MA15 as a live, attenuated vaccine showed potential cross-protection against challenge with SARS-CoV, but the results have important caveats. We infected young mice with 104 p.f.u. of SHC014-MA15 and observed them for 28 d. We then challenged the mice with SARS-MA15 at day 29 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The prior infection of the mice with the high dose of SHC014-MA15 conferred protection against challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-MA15, although there was only a minimal SARS-CoV neutralization response from the antisera elicited 28 d after SHC014-MA15 infection (Supplementary Fig. 6b, 1:200). In the absence of a secondary antigen boost, 28 d.p.i. represents the expected peak of antibody titers and implies that there will be diminished protection against SARS-CoV over time16,17. Similar results showing protection against challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV were observed in aged BALB/c mice with respect to weight loss and viral replication (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). However, the SHC014-MA15 infection dose of 104 p.f.u. induced >10% weight loss and lethality in some aged animals (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). We found that vaccination with a lower dose of SHC014-MA15 (100 p.f.u.), did not induce weight loss, but it also failed to protect aged animals from a SARS-MA15 lethal dose challenge (Supplementary Fig. 6e,f). Together, the data suggest that the SHC014-MA15 challenge may confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV through conserved epitopes, but the required dose induces pathogenesis and precludes use as an attenuated vaccine.\n\nHaving established that the SHC014 spike has the ability to mediate infection of human cells and cause disease in mice, we next synthesized a full-length SHC014-CoV infectious clone based on the approach used for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3a)2. Replication in Vero cells revealed no deficit for SHC014-CoV relative to that for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3b); however, SHC014-CoV was significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated in primary HAE cultures at both 24 and 48 h after infection (Fig. 3c). In vivo infection of mice demonstrated no significant weight loss but showed reduced viral replication in lungs of full-length SHC014-CoV infection, as compared to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 3d,e). Together, the results establish the viability of full-length SHC014-CoV but suggest that further adaptation is required for its replication to be equivalent to that of epidemic SARS-CoV in human respiratory cells and in mice.\n\nFigure 3: Full-length SHC014-CoV replicates in human airways but lacks the virulence of epidemic SARS-CoV.\n\n(a) Schematic of the SHC014-CoV molecular clone, which was synthesized as six contiguous cDNAs (designated SHC014A, SHC014B, SHC014C, SHC014D, SHC014E and SHC014F) flanked by unique BglI sites that allowed for directed assembly of the full-length cDNA expressing open reading frames (for 1a, 1b, spike, 3, envelope, matrix, 6–8 and nucleocapsid). Underlined nucleotides represent the overhang sequences formed after restriction enzyme cleavage. (b,c) Viral replication of SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-CoV (green) after infection of Vero cells (b) or well-differentiated, primary air-liquid interface HAE cell cultures (c) at an MOI of 0.01. Samples were collected at individual time points with biological replicates (n = 3) for each group. Data represent one experiment for both Vero and HAE cells. (d,e) Weight loss (n = 3 for SARS-CoV MA15, n = 7 for SHC014-CoV; n = 6 for SARS-Urbani) (d) and viral replication in the lungs (n = 3 for SARS-Urbani and SHC014-CoV) (e) of 10-week-old BALB/c mice infected with 1 × 105 p.f.u. of SARS-CoV MA15 (gray), SHC014-CoV (green) or SARS-CoV Urbani (black) via the i.n. route. Each data point represents the group mean, and error bars define the s.e.m. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 using two-tailed Student’s t-test of individual time points.\n\nDuring the SARS-CoV epidemic, links were quickly established between palm civets and the CoV strains that were detected in humans4.\n\nBuilding on this finding, the common emergence paradigm argues that epidemic SARS-CoV originated as a bat virus, jumped to civets, and incorporated changes within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to improve binding to civet Ace2 (ref. 18).\n\nSubsequent exposure to people in live-animal markets permitted human infection with the civet strain, which, in turn, adapted to become the epidemic strain (Fig. 4a).\n\nHowever, phylogenetic analysis suggests that early human SARS strains appear more closely related to bat strains than to civet strains18.\n\nTherefore, a second paradigm argues that direct bat-human transmission initiated SARS-CoV emergence and that palm civets served as a secondary host and reservoir for continued infection (Fig. 4b)19. For both paradigms, spike adaptation in a secondary host is seen as a necessity, with most mutations expected to occur within the RBD, thereby facilitating improved infection. Both theories imply that pools of bat CoVs are limited and that host-range mutations are both random and rare, reducing the likelihood of future emergence events in humans.\n\nFigure 4: Emergence paradigms for coronaviruses.\n\nCoronavirus strains are maintained in quasi-species pools circulating in bat populations. (a,b) Traditional SARS-CoV emergence theories posit that host-range mutants (red circle) represent random and rare occurrences that permit infection of alternative hosts. The secondary-host paradigm (a) argues that a nonhuman host is infected by a bat progenitor virus and, through adaptation, facilitates transmission to humans; subsequent replication in humans leads to the epidemic viral strain. The direct paradigm (b) suggests that transmission occurs between bats and humans without the requirement of an intermediate host; selection then occurs in the human population with closely related viruses replicating in a secondary host, permitting continued viral persistence and adaptation in both. (c) The data from chimeric SARS-like viruses argue that the quasi-species pools maintain multiple viruses capable of infecting human cells without the need for mutations (red circles). Although adaptations in secondary or human hosts may be required for epidemic emergence, if SHC014 spike–containing viruses recombined with virulent CoV backbones (circles with green outlines), then epidemic disease may be the result in humans. Existing data support elements of all three paradigms.\n\nFull size image\n\nAlthough our study does not invalidate the other emergence routes, it does argue for a third paradigm in which circulating bat CoV pools maintain ‘poised’ spike proteins that are capable of infecting humans without mutation or adaptation (Fig. 4c). This hypothesis is illustrated by the ability of a chimeric virus containing the SHC014 spike in a SARS-CoV backbone to cause robust infection in both human airway cultures and in mice without RBD adaptation.\n\nCoupled with the observation of previously identified pathogenic CoV backbones3,20, our results suggest that the starting materials required for SARS-like emergent strains are currently circulating in animal reservoirs. Notably, although full-length SHC014-CoV probably requires additional backbone adaption to mediate human disease, the documented high-frequency recombination events in CoV families underscores the possibility of future emergence and the need for further preparation.\n\nTo date, genomics screens of animal populations have primarily been used to identify novel viruses in outbreak settings21. The approach here extends these data sets to examine questions of viral emergence and therapeutic efficacy. We consider viruses with the SHC014 spike a potential threat owing to their ability to replicate in primary human airway cultures, the best available model for human disease. In addition, the observed pathogenesis in mice indicates a capacity for SHC014-containing viruses to cause disease in mammalian models, without RBD adaptation.\n\nNotably, differential tropism in the lung as compared to that with SARS-MA15 and attenuation of full-length SHC014-CoV in HAE cultures relative to SARS-CoV Urbani suggest that factors beyond ACE2 binding—including spike processivity, receptor bio-availability or antagonism of the host immune responses—may contribute to the emergence. However, further testing in nonhuman primates is required to translate these findings into the pathogenic potential in humans.\n\nImportantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and for the development of treatments. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents, and effective treatments can be produced that are protective against the emergence of group 2b–specific CoVs, such as SHC014, and these can be applied to other CoV branches that maintain similarly heterogeneous pools.\n\nIn addition to offering preparation against future emerging viruses, this approach must be considered in the context of the US government-mandated pause on gain-of-function (GOF) studies22.\n\nOn the basis of previous models of emergence (Fig. 4a,b), the creation of chimeric viruses such as SHC014-MA15 was not expected to increase pathogenicity. Although SHC014-MA15 is attenuated relative to its parental mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, similar studies examining the pathogenicity of CoVs with the wild-type Urbani spike within the MA15 backbone showed no weight loss in mice and reduced viral replication23. Thus, relative to the Urbani spike–MA15 CoV, SHC014-MA15 shows again in pathogenesis (Fig. 1).\n\nOn the basis of these findings, scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue, as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded.\n\nCoupled with restrictions on mouse-adapted strains and the development of monoclonal antibodies using escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.\n\nOverall, our approach has used metagenomics data to identify a potential threat posed by the circulating bat SARS-like CoV SHC014. Because of the ability of chimeric SHC014 viruses to replicate in human airway cultures, cause pathogenesis in vivo and escape current therapeutics, there is a need for both surveillance and improved therapeutics against circulating SARS-like viruses. Our approach also unlocks the use of metagenomics data to predict viral emergence and to apply this knowledge in preparing to treat future emerging virus infections.\n\nMethods\n\nViruses, cells, in vitro infection and plaque assays\n\nWild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani), mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) and chimeric SARS-like CoVs were cultured on Vero E6 cells (obtained from United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases), grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, CA) and 5% fetal clone serum (FCS) (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) along with antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). DBT cells (Baric laboratory, source unknown) expressing ACE2 orthologs have been previously described for both human and civet; bat Ace2 sequence was based on that from Rhinolophus leschenaulti, and DBT cells expressing bat Ace2 were established as described previously8.\n\nPseudotyping experiments were similar to those using an HIV-based pseudovirus, prepared as previously described10, and examined on HeLa cells (Wuhan Institute of Virology) that expressed ACE2 orthologs. HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Gibco, CA) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco, CA) as previously described24.\n\nGrowth curves in Vero E6, DBT, Calu-3 2B4, and primary human airway epithelial cells were performed as previously described8,25. None of the working cell line stocks were authenticated or tested for mycoplasma recently, although the original seed stocks used to create the working stocks are free from contamination. Human lungs for HAE cultures were procured under the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board–approved protocols. HAE cultures represent highly differentiated human airway epithelium containing ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells as well as goblet cells. The cultures are also grown on an air-liquid interface for several weeks before use, as previously described26.\n\nBriefly, cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with the virus or mock-diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37 °C. After inoculation, cells were washed three times and a fresh medium was added to signify time ‘0’. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at each described time point. No blinding was used in any sample collections nor was samples randomized. All virus cultivation was performed in a biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory with redundant fans in the biosafety cabinets, as described previously by our group2. All personnel wore powered air-purifying respirators (Breathe Easy, 3M) with Tyvek suits, aprons, and booties and were double-gloved.\n\nSequence clustering and structural modeling.\n\nThe full-length genomic sequences and the amino acid sequences of the S1 domains of the spike of representative CoVs were downloaded from Genbank or Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), aligned with ClustalX and phylogenetically compared by using maximum likelihood estimation using 100 bootstraps or by using the PhyML package, respectively. The tree was generated using maximum likelihood with the PhyML package. The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions. Only nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are labeled.\n\nThe tree shows that CoVs are divided into three distinct phylogenetic groups defined as α-CoVs, β-CoVs, and γ-CoVs. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d for β-CoVs, and 1a and 1b for the α-CoVs. Structural models were generated using Modeller (Max Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit) to generate homology models for SHC014 and Rs3367 of the SARS RBD in complex with ACE2 based on crystal structure 2AJF (Protein Data Bank). Homology models were visualized and manipulated in MacPyMol (version 1.3).\n\nConstruction of SARS-like chimeric viruses.\n\nBoth wild-type and chimeric viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or the corresponding mouse-adapted (SARS-CoV MA15) infectious clone (ic) as previously described27.\n\nPlasmids containing spike sequences for SHC014 were extracted by restriction digest and ligated into the E and F plasmid of the MA15 infectious clone. The clone was designed and purchased from Bio Basic as six contiguous cDNAs using published sequences flanked by unique class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI). Thereafter, plasmids containing wild-type, chimeric SARS-CoV, and SHC014-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified.\n\nIn vitro transcription reactions were then performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells as previously described2. The medium from transfected cells was harvested and served as seed stocks for subsequent experiments. Chimeric and full-length viruses were confirmed by sequence analysis before use in these studies. Synthetic construction of chimeric mutant and full-length SHC014-CoV was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Dual Use Research of Concern committee.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for the care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC, Permit Number A-3410-01) approved the animal study protocol (IACUC #13-033) used in these studies.\n\nMice and in vivo infection\n\nFemale, 10-week-old, and 12-month-old BALB/cAnNHsD mice were ordered from Harlan Laboratories. Mouse infections were done as previously described20. Briefly, animals were brought into a BSL3 laboratory and allowed to acclimate for 1 week before infection. For infection and live-attenuated virus vaccination, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and infected intranasally, when challenged, with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or diluted virus with three or four mice per time point, per infection group per dose as described in the figure legends.\n\nFor individual mice, notations for infection including failure to inhale the entire dose, bubbling of inoculum from the nose, or infection through the mouth may have led to exclusion of mouse data at the discretion of the researcher; post-infection, no other pre-established exclusion or inclusion criteria are defined. No blinding was used in any animal experiments, and animals were not randomized. For vaccination, young and aged mice were vaccinated by footpad injection with a 20-μl volume of either 0.2 μg of double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with alum or mock PBS; mice were then boosted with the same regimen 22 d later and challenged 21 d thereafter.\n\nFor all groups, as per protocol, animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease (hunching, ruffled fur, and reduced activity) for the duration of the experiment. Weight loss was monitored daily for the first 7 d, after which weight monitoring continued until the animals recovered to their initial starting weight or displayed weight gain continuously for 3 d.\n\nAll mice that lost greater than 20% of their starting body weight were ground-fed and further monitored multiple times per day as long as they were under the 20% cutoff. Mice that lost greater than 30% of their starting body weight were immediately sacrificed as per protocol. Any mouse deemed to be moribund or unlikely to recover was also humanely sacrificed at the discretion of the researcher. Euthanasia was performed using an isoflurane overdose and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation. All mouse studies were performed at the University of North Carolina (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3410-01) using protocols approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nHistological analysis.\n\nThe left lung was removed and submerged in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) without inflation for 1 week. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 5-μm sections were prepared by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center histopathology core facility. To determine the extent of antigen staining, sections were stained for viral antigen using a commercially available polyclonal SARS-CoV anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Imgenex) and scored in a blinded manner by for staining of the airway and parenchyma as previously described20. Images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera.\n\nVirus neutralization assays.\n\nPlaque reduction neutralization titer assays were performed with previously characterized antibodies against SARS-CoV, as previously described11,\n\n12,13\n\n. Briefly, neutralizing antibodies or serum was serially diluted twofold and incubated with 100 p.f.u. of the different infectious clone, SARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37 °C. The virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate with 5 × 105 Vero E6 cells/well with multiple replicates (n ≥ 2). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in a medium. Plates were incubated for 2 d at 37 °C, stained with neutral red for 3 h, and plaques were counted. The percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as (1 − (no. of plaques with an antibody/no. of plaques without antibody)) × 100.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll experiments were conducted contrasting two experimental groups (either two viruses, or vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts). Therefore, significant differences in viral titer and histology scoring were determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test at individual time points. Data were normally distributed in each group being compared and had similar variance.\n\nBiosafety and biosecurity\n\nReported studies were initiated after the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee approved the experimental protocol (Project Title: Generating infectious clones of bat SARS-like CoVs; Lab Safety Plan ID: 20145741; Schedule G ID: 12279).\n\nThese studies were initiated before the US Government Deliberative Process Research Funding Pause on Selected Gain-of-Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS, and SARS Viruses. This paper has been reviewed by the funding agency, the NIH. Continuation of these studies was requested, and this has been approved by the NIH.\n\nSARS-CoV is a select agent. All work for these studies was performed with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safety conditions for SARS-CoV, MERs-CoV, and other related CoVs. Our institutional CoV BSL3 facilities have been designed to conform to the safety requirements that are recommended in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NIH. Laboratory safety plans were submitted to, and the facility has been approved for use by, the UNC Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and the CDC. Electronic card access is required for entry into the facility.\n\nAll workers have been trained by EHS to safely use powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and appropriate work habits in a BSL3 facility and active medical surveillance plans are in place. Our CoV BSL3 facilities contain redundant fans, emergency power to fans and biological safety cabinets and freezers, and our facilities can accommodate SealSafe mouse racks. Materials classified as BSL3 agents consist of SARS-CoV, bat CoV precursor strains, MERS-CoV and mutants derived from these pathogens. Within the BSL3 facilities, experimentation with an infectious virus is performed in a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet (BSC).\n\nAll members of the staff wear scrubs, Tyvek suits and aprons, PAPRs and shoe covers, and their hands are double-gloved. BSL3 users are subject to a medical surveillance plan monitored by the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (UEOHC), which includes a yearly physical, annual influenza vaccination and mandatory reporting of any symptoms associated with CoV infection during periods when working in the BSL3. All BSL3 users are trained in exposure management and reporting protocols, are prepared to self-quarantine and have been trained for safe delivery to a local infectious disease management department in an emergency situation. All potential exposure events are reported and investigated by EHS and UEOHC, with reports filed to both the CDC and the NIH.\n\nAccession codes\n\nAccessions\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\n2AJF\n\nChange history\n\n20 November 2015\n\nIn the version of this article initially published online, the authors omitted to acknowledge a funding source, USAID-EPT-PREDICT funding from EcoHealth Alliance, to Z.-L.S.

        "Joe Biden’s Asthma, Cancer and Coronavirus\n\nJoe Biden Health Concerns (11 minutes)\n\nJoe Biden said yesterday that he has cancer because of oil refineries in Delaware. Three months ago, Biden said the oil refineries gave him asthma. Whichever it is, one thing is for sure, the quadruple-boosted fake president has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nBuy Electric Cars … Powered by Fossil Fuels (16 minutes)\n\nThe climate change czars plan to end fossil fuel dependence by switching to vehicles that run on electricity—electricity that is generated by fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the U.S. is subsidizing Chinese companies to mine the lithium necessary for EV batteries from mines within the United States!\n\n‘Trump’s Return’ (13 minutes)\n\n“Trump’s return” is the cover story of this weekend’s Spectator magazine. The article highlights Donald Trump’s impressive domestic and international accomplishments. It says, “If Trump announces he is running for the Republican nomination, he’ll be almost impossible to stop.”\n\nHalf of Americans Expect a Second Civil War (5 minutes)\n\nAn article from the Daily Mail reports that 50 percent of Americans believe that “in the next few years, there will be a civil war in the U.S.” The U.S. is also facing a crime wave, partially due to the effects of COVID lockdowns.\n\nUnderstand the Depths of Satan (9 minutes)\n\nIf we understand the “depths of Satan” (Revelation 2:24), we will not be blindsided by the extent of the evil in our nation’s government. In a world that is quickly falling apart, we must renew God’s endless hope in our minds every day."

        "China is using covid apps to suppress political dissidents, according to a July 17 report in Germany’s Tagesspiegel. Such apps regarding a person’s vaccination or covid status are required in many countries. Will other nations also begin misusing these apps?\n\nLife without the health app has become virtually impossible in China’s big cities. You need it to use public transport, to work and to go shopping. At first, people thought it was for their own good. But now it’s no longer focused on whether you follow the public health guidelines; it’s focus is how the government sees you: generally submissive or rebellious.\n\nTagesspiegel recounted the story of human rights lawyer Wang Yu, who has been increasingly restricted by the app, regardless of her compliance to covid-19 regulations. “Wang Yu has not been able to move freely for some time. She is a lawyer in China—and a critic of the authoritarian Chinese regime. She has often been put under house arrest. But lately, the regime apparently has a different method: Her health app doesn’t show the green code—even though she previously got a negative pcr test three times,” wrote Tagesspiegel. The app has even showed her visiting regions with high infection rates. All this appears to be an effort to bar Wang from society.\n\nAt one point, Wang was rejected entrance into her apartment complex. While she was eventually able to argue her way in, she said that “you don’t know what tomorrow will be. Maybe the guard won’t let me through then. And I can’t break in here.”\n\nShe, like so many, is constantly surveilled. Every time the QR code in the app is scanned, the police receive a comprehensive movement profile of the owner.\n\nDigitalization has been promised to simplify our lives, but it is becoming the government’s primary tool to control us. In “Is Your Coffee Spying on You?”, theTrumpet.com assistant managing editor Richard Palmer related another similar incident in China:\n\nIn June, China gave us an alarming example of what this technology makes possible. Some Chinese banks were running out of cash and began blocking some depositors from withdrawing money. Angry depositors planned a protest in the province of Henan. Their plan failed. China requires a covid passport to travel. Those planning to protest suddenly saw their health codes turn red, locking them in place. Others who planned to travel to Henan but not to protest were unaffected. The government knew who was likely to protest and locked them in place electronically. “They are putting digital handcuffs on us,” complained one failed protester. Another said, “I can’t do anything; I can’t go anywhere. You’re treated as though you’re a criminal.”\n\nThese incidents are becoming more and more frequent. While the government still pretends to have the people’s best interest in mind, China’s police state could soon be even more blatant in enforcing its will. But while people generally warn about China, we have to realize that the Western world is utilizing the same technologies that can lead to the same outcome.\n\nTrumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry has warned that these dictatorial measures are prophesied to come to Europe. The coronavirus has hastened this. To learn what the Bible reveals about this, read Mr. Flurry’s article “Coronavirus and the Holy Roman Empire.”\n\nIn “Where Are Vaccine Passports Leading?”, Palmer wrote:\n\nNot even the Soviet Union was able to track its citizens’ movements in real time. Such a system could be misused in many ways. Once a government builds it, it could use the same infrastructure to track, check and exclude people for any reason. A big red X could show up on the screen of the train conductor, job interviewer, café cashier, banker, school administrator, social worker, police officer or government agent if the person shows up in the government database as unvaccinated, unregistered in some other government scheme, guilty of something the government has declared a crime, involved in a certain political party, possessing membership in a certain religious group, having contacted certain people, having read certain material, or having posted a certain opinion online. The infrastructure for vaccine passports won’t do all these things, but it will do most of the heavy lifting. And crucially, it will break perhaps the first and biggest barrier of all: citizens’ resistance to surrendering their rights. The infrastructure we are talking about—that elites in your national government are talking about—can determine your ability to buy, to sell, to work. This has reminded many people of a particular verse in the Bible: “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name” (Revelation 13:17).\n\nVaccine passports, covid apps or any other government instrument to restrict people is not the mark of the beast. People who believe this may be completely caught off guard when the mark of the beast comes and may accept it unknowingly. Yet our digitalized world makes the enforcement of this mark easier than ever. To understand what this mark is, you have to understand what the Bible says about it in its full context. This is explained in our free booklet Who or What Is the Prophetic Beast?, by Herbert W. Armstrong."

        "Wife of former Connecticut state representative admits to stealing COVID-19 funds\n\nThe wife of a former Connecticut state lawmaker pleaded guilty for stealing more than $600,000 in federal relief funds for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) from the city of West Haven.\n\nLauren DiMassa, wife of former Connecticut Rep. Michael DiMassa, is one of several people arrested during the investigation. She pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in the U.S. District County in Hartford. However, sentencing has not yet been scheduled and she remains free on bail.\n\nFederal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa nearly $148,000 for services that she never provided to the city. She and her husband were also accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services, such as youth violence prevention.\n\nHer lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that she turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council.\n\nMichael DiMassa has held several positions in the city, including administrative assistant to the West Haven City Council, clerk of the West Haven City Council, assistant to the West Haven mayor and assistant to the West Haven registrar of voters.\n\nIn late 2020, West Haven’s Democratic Mayor Nancy Rossi designated him as one of the two city officials who have been given authority to approve spending on COVID-19 issues. (Related: Rural California counties claim Dem governor withholding pandemic funds.)\n\nHe resigned from his position as a state representative and aide to the city council following his arrest in October, but he pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nProsecutors, however, alleged that Michael DiMassa used his position as a lawmaker to steal the money and finance his gambling activities at the Mohegan Sun Casino.\n\nHis former business partner, John Bernardo, who served as a housing specialist for the city, pleaded guilty to a federal wire fraud charge last month for his role in the theft. A fourth person charged in the case, John Trassaco, pleaded not guilty. Trasacco is a business owner linked to the fraudulent invoices submitted to the city for COVID-19 services that were never provided.\n\nFraud case opened in February\n\nThe case first came to light in February, with DiMassa, his wife, Bernardo and Tracasso charged with stealing the $600,000 by submitting fraudulent invoices to the city through a company they formed in January 2021 called Compass Investment Group, LLC.\n\nThe city of West Haven received over $1.1 million in federal pandemic relief funds between July 2020 and September 2021. The indictment alleged that DiMassa, who was authorized to approve the reimbursement of COVID-related expenditures, conspired with the others to steal the said funds.\n\nThe indictment further alleged that DiMassa and Trasacco conspired to submit fraudulent invoices through two entities controlled by the latter – L&H Company and JIL Sanitation Services – for “goods and services.” These included thousands of units of PPE, HVAC maintenance at multiple municipal locations, COVID-related supplies for the city’s Board of Education and cleaning services for municipal and school buildings, including one that had been vacant for years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, both companies received approximately $421,982.\n\nDiMassa and his wife have also been accused of submitting numerous fraudulent invoices for services related to youth violence programs, including counseling services, meals, support group supplies and wi-fi assistance for lower-to-moderate income families.\n\nThe indictment further stated that the city of West Haven made at least 16 payments totaling $147,776 to DiMassa’s wife, who never provided services to the city.\n\nVisit Corruption.news for more updates about cases involving corrupt politicians in America.\n\nWest Haven is not the only city that funneled its federal coronavirus budget.

        "No matter your thoughts on the coronavirus, there is no denying the damage it has caused to America, the economy, and countless families across the country. From government overreach to media misinformation, it appears the officials who are in charge only know how to do one thing – throw money at the pandemic. Over the course of COVID-19, the government seemed more than generous with approving stimulus packages aimed at keeping American families afloat, but come to find out, those payments were rather small when compared to what Michigan county officials paid themselves using COVID-19 funds.\n\nWith the news breaking this week, many Michigan voters are wanting answers as reports show that elected officials used $65,000 of relief money to make themselves richer. And to make it even worse, they are all Republicans. Voting on the matter last week, Commissioners in Shiawassee County decided to award public employees, including themselves, with a one-time bonus of $1,000. Deeming it “hazard pay”, most employees received far more than just $1,000.\n\nAccording to reports, the average employee was given around $2,100, and that doesn’t include top-level employees like the county board chairman, Jeremy Root. He generously received $25,000 while second-tier commissioners like Brandon Marks and John Plowman were awarded $10,000 apiece. The remaining officials were given around $5,000 each. It should be noted that the County commissioners are currently paid $10,000 annually for their part-time jobs.\n\nEven with the shocking revelation, one county commissioner, Cindy Garber, stood by the decision, claiming she deserved the money. “I think that I earned it. I work really hard at this job. I was here in person all through this crazy year.” Although it has been a crazy year, Garber seems to forget that all Americans, especially the working class, experienced the same hardships as those elected officials. – READ MORE"

        "The U.S. Department of Justice has opted against investigating any of the Democrat governors who last year ordered nursing homes to accept residents who tested positive for COVID-19 against the recommendations of health groups.\n\nFederal officials reviewed information they received from New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey last year regarding the orders.\n\nBased on the review, they’re not opening Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) investigations in the first three states, Joe Gaeta, deputy assistant attorney general, told Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) in a letter on July 23. The act enables the attorney general to initiate a case in court against a state or local government, or its employees or agents, when officials suspect or find that people in institutions owned or run by such a government have had their rights denied.\n\nThe Department of Justice opened a CRIPA probe into conditions at two nursing facilities operated by the state of New Jersey in October 2020 but has given no indication that it’s investigating Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nScalise, the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, reacted strongly to the refusal to investigate Murphy or governors of the other states, all of whom are Democrats. – READ MORE"

        "Desperate media trying to keep covid delusion alive, but hospital officials reveal it’s all “hype”\n\nMore than two years have passed since the “national emergency” was first declared, and hospital administrators are having a harder time going along with the narrative. Now, one of the largest hospital systems in Southern California finally diverted from the narrative. At a recent press conference, Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer of Los Angeles County and epidemiologist Paul Holtom rebuked the corporate media and took a swipe at the government’s terror tactics.\n\n“It is just not the same pandemic that it was, despite all the media hype to the contrary… Spellberg said. “I mean – a lot of people have bad colds is what we’re seeing.”\n\nLA Doctors finally rebuke terror and deception, perpetuated by government and media\n\nLos Angeles County health director Barbara Ferrer just declared that the county was in a “high” level of Covid transmission. If she could convince 10 million LA residents that this “high” level of COVID transmission is real for another two consecutive weeks, she could then impose a new indoor mask mandate, per her own made-up rules.\n\nJust one day after Barbara Ferrer tried to con Los Angeles into further oppression, epidemiologist Paul Holtom spoke at a press conference, rebuking the narrative. “As of this morning, we have no one in the hospital who had pulmonary disease due to Covid. Nobody in the hospital….NOBODY.”\n\nChief Medical Officer Brad Spellberg presented the actual case data and hospital admission data. “The numbers at [LAC+USC] Covid-positive tests have continued to go up, but this isn’t because we’re seeing a ton of people with symptomatic disease being admitted,” Spellberg said. “We’re seeing a lot of people with mild disease in urgent care and [emergency department] who go home and do not get admitted.”\n\n“Of those who are admitted, they’re 90% of the time not admitted due to Covid. Only 10% of our Covid-positive admissions are admitted due to Covid. Virtually none of them go to the ICU, and when they do go to the ICU, it is not for pneumonia. They are not intubated.”\n\nSpellberg iterated that it has been “months” since the hospital has seen a COVID cases that requires ICU admission. He said the COVID ICU admissions usually present with an “auto-immune attack of the nerves that may or may not be Covid-driven.”\n\nHospital administrators have complied with a fraudulent narrative for far too long\n\nWhen covid-19 propaganda and medical tyranny first swept the nation, hospital CEOs and administrators largely kept their mouths shut. Lock downs ensued, and people across the nation did not receive critical health care services in their time of need. Patients were unduly isolated from their families and subjected to deadly remdesivir, sedation and ventilator protocols. These issues are still taking place in hospitals nationwide.\n\nA “national state of emergency” allowed hospitals to enjoy financial incentives every time a fraudulently-calibrated PCR test presented false evidence for a covid-19 diagnosis. Under this medical tyranny, a patient’s true cause of death does not matter. If covid-19 is “suspected” or “could not be ruled out,” it is codified as the cause of death. Worse, this ongoing “national emergency” allows hospital staff to enjoy indemnity from medical error and iatrogenic death — which is one of the top causes of death in the US.\n\nThe PREP Act enabled the Department of Health and Human Services to issue broad immunity protections to health care professionals who administer or use countermeasures during the national state of emergency. The CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, provided federal liability protections for volunteer health care professionals. The Biden regime renewed the medical tyranny and signed a new decree in February of 2022, allowing the national state of emergency and all of its liability protections to persist.\n\nHospital administrators may be hesitant to stand up to oppressive government protocols and fear-mongering media, because they are afraid of losing their liability protections.

        "WHO is planning to keep the pandemic going for 10 years, pushing new diseases if necessary\n\nThe globalists in the World Health Organization (WHO) are preparing to unleash the next infectious disease to keep the world under control until at least 2030.\n\nThis is according to Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who works with the WHO. She admitted during an interview that the organization has a 10-year plan, supposedly to deal with the current Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and an expected second pandemic. (Related: WHO attempts to take control of future plandemics in a “totalitarian power grab” move.)\n\n“This has been in the WHO’s 10-year plan for some time,” said Koopmans. “That plan says that there will be a major infectious disease crisis.”\n\n“Why does the WHO have a 10-year plan announcing 10 years of pandemics? How can they know?” asked David Sorensen in a video detailing evidence that the WHO is planning to keep the pandemic going until 2030.\n\nFor context, Koopmans is a former member of the WHO’s first team to go to China to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was removed from the group following reports revealing her extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIndependent news site the National Pulse exposed Koopmans’ role on a scientific advisory board for the Centers for Disease Control of Guangdong, China.\n\n“She has advised on the building of the laboratory capacity for emerging infectious disease detection in this region, and has ongoing research collaborations trying to unravel emergence and spread of viruses through the animal production chain in this region,” read a summary of her work with the Chinese-run body.\n\nBill Gates heavily involved in planning the next pandemic\n\nBill Gates, who has accumulated an additional $50 billion in wealth simply by distributing vaccines, is part of the effort preparing the world to accept that the next pandemic is on its way.\n\nDuring an interview with liberal comedian Stephen Colbert, Gates admitted that there will be a “pandemic two” once the world is no longer willing to go along with the restrictions put in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, which he calls “pandemic one.”\n\n“Most of the work we’re going to do to be ready for pandemic two – I call this pandemic one – most of the work we’ll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism,” said Gates.\n\nIn a separate interview, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda even admitted that the next pandemic will keep people’s attention focused on the spreading disease.\n\n“We’ll have to prepare for the next one. That will get attention this time,” he said. Both he and Melinda were grinning and chuckling the whole time they were announcing the coming of the second pandemic.\n\nGates has been preparing for the pandemic as early as 2018, when he said a global pandemic is on its way and that it could wipe out as many as 30 million people.\n\n“Bill Gates is essentially the owner of the WHO,” commented Sorensen. He added that thousands of physicians and scientists worldwide agree that the WHO- and Gates-engineered pandemic was planned with the purpose of increasing the globalists’ control over the world and reducing the world population.\n\nLearn more about the plans of the globalists at Globalism.news.\n\nWatch this video from David Sorensen as he discusses the WHO’s 10-year plan for ongoing infectious diseases from 2020 to 2030.\n\nThis video can be found in the channel The Prisoner on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nInternational group funded by Bill Gates warns that one of 11 new viruses will become “next pandemic.”\n\nBiden wants more money to prepare for the “second pandemic” he promises is coming.\n\nDr. Jim Meehan: Monkeypox outbreak was ENGINEERED because people are no longer afraid of C OVID-19.\n\nNonprofit funded by CNN co-founder was PREPARING for the monkeypox outbreak in 2021.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nTheNewAmerican.com\n\nStopWorldControl.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New Zealand doctors call for criminal homicide investigations into covid-19 vaccine deaths\n\nThe group New Zealand Doctors Speaking out With Science (NZDSOS) has published an open letter calling for a comprehensive investigation into the wave of deaths occurring in New Zealand among the “fully vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\nA redacted version is available for the public to read, while an unredacted version is still being carefully prepared for law enforcement to ensure it contains all of the necessary information for a proper investigation to be conducted.\n\nAccording to the group, there is a “shockingly large burden of deaths and injuries following the Covid-19 vaccine, of itself and compared to any other treatment or vaccine in modern times.”\n\n“We report many cases that DEMAND proper investigation, as befits any medication lacking safety studies,” the letter’s executive summary further states.\n\nNZDSOS says the country’s surveillance systems, which would otherwise catch these injuries and deaths, have been disabled “in order to hide the extent of harm.”\n\n“Adverse event reporting is NOT COMPULSORY, and this alone undermines any attempt to portray the injections as safe,” the group further explains.\n\n“CARM (New Zealand’s version of the U.S.-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) was never designed to early warn about experimental drugs rolled out to massive numbers.”\n\nPost-covid injection deaths are the elephant in the room that nobody wants to address\n\nPerhaps most concerning are the large numbers of young children who after getting shot are suffering cardiac injuries that used to only occur among the elderly – though many elderly people have mysteriously died post-jab as well.\n\nSeeing as how children have a zero percent risk of dying from covid, let alone getting sick from it in the first place, jabbing them is arguably the worst crime against humanity that has occurred in modern times.\n\n“We believe we are being lied to,” says NZDSOS. “We appeal AGAIN to the Police, headed by Andrew Coster, and our MPs (members of parliament), to intervene to protect the People.\n\nHalfway through the letter, a long list of cases is presented showing that post-injection injuries and deaths are anything but “rare.” They are disturbingly and obviously common when looking at the data, though few are brave enough to actually look.\n\nA summary of some 500 post-injection deaths is included in the letter, as recorded in the Citizen’s Database. A community group of volunteers with backgrounds in healthcare, information technology and science help to maintain it with the support of epidemiology and database professionals.\n\n“It has been built mainly from notifications by relatives, friends and health workers of people who have died following the covid-19 shots,” the letter explains.\n\n“Scientific accuracy forbids the use of the word ‘vaccine,’ since it does not prevent the disease nor its transmission. Some information has been gleaned from social media posts, newspaper reports and obituaries. Has anyone noticed how many there are? ‘Taken too soon,’ ‘sudden and unexpected’ adorn the pages.”\n\nBecause the so-called “authorities” refuse to even look into the situation at all is a huge red flag all on its own. If the jabs really are “safe and effective” as claimed, then there should be no problem looking through each case in order to debunk it as unrelated to the injections, right?\n\nThis is the elephant in the room that almost nobody in any position of power is willing to address, and NZDSOS is demanding once again that someone step up to the plate and take the matter seriously on behalf of public health.\n\n“Whatever the actual truth, NZDSOS and many others are certain that the true number of dead and injured people is very elevated, and not made clear to the public, who thus continue to sleepwalk into a treatment that is much more dangerous than the disease it purports to prevent, especially for the young,” the group says.\n\nThe latest news coverage about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” injuries and deaths can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNZDSOS.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Zuckerberg warns that COVID-19 vaccines are “experimental” and “unproven” in a leaked video (but Facebook bans you if you say the same thing)\n\nA leaked video of Meta Platforms, Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed him cautioning his inner circle of the unproven effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines he called “experimental gene technology.”\n\nAware of the unsubstantiated curing effects and potential dangers of the vaccines, the tech giant chief felt compelled to alert his people regarding the shots on July 16, 2020 – five months before the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I just want to make sure that I share some caution on this [vaccine] because we just don’t know the long-term side-effects of basically modifying people’s DNA and RNA to directly encode in a person’s DNA and RNA basically the ability to produce those antibodies and whether that causes other mutations or other risks downstream,” Zuckerberg said in the leaked video, which was taken during an internal meeting at Facebook (FB).\n\nProject Veritas founder James O’Keefe noted during the release of the video last year that Zuckerberg would have been “censored on the platform” if what he said to his staff in July was posted on Facebook. He would be “basically violating his own code of conduct,” O’Keefe said.\n\n“It is yet another case of ‘one rule for thee, and another for me’ that the elite use to control the masses,” news website News Punch said.\n\nBack in 2019, the media magnate spoke in front of students at Georgetown University about the importance of protecting free expression. He highlighted his belief that giving everyone a voice gives power to the powerless and pushes society to be better over time – a belief that is at the core of Facebook, he said.\n\nHowever, the freedom to express has been throttled on Facebook and the other major social media platforms in recent years.\n\nMeta had censored 20 million posts since start of pandemic\n\nLast year, FB and Instagram (IG), which is also under the Meta Platforms umbrella, banned major groups, accounts and IG pages for speaking out and raising concerns and doubts about the vaccines’ adverse effects.\n\nAccording to a Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Report last year, FB removed 65 of its own and 243 IG accounts for spreading “misinformation” about the COVID-19 vaccines. They have removed more than 20 million individual posts since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with CBS in August last year, TV anchor Gayle King asked Zuckerberg to release information on how many people have viewed and shared FB posts containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHe admitted that FB has removed millions of posts containing misinformation from their website, but failed to answer when pressed by the host on how many people viewed or shared these posts.\n\n“I think, to some degree, there are also different definitions that people have over what misinformation is. A lot of the stuff that’s actually the hardest for us to really address is not what I would call ‘misinformation’ but instead another category that I would call ‘hesitancy,'” he said at the time. (Related: House Republicans demand Zuckerberg surrender all communications with Fauci over covid-19 and “vaccine hesitancy” censorship.)\n\nOne of the well-known personalities that have been banned from social media is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who emerged as one of the most influential voices during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKennedy Jr., who describes himself as a vaccine safety advocate, was not impressed with Bill Gates’ track record of pushing vaccines on vulnerable populations, causing serious health problems in some cases. Subsequently, Meta “fact-checkers” banned Kennedy Jr. from Instagram for speaking out about vaccine safety.\n\nVisit TechGiants.news for more articles related to social media censorships.\n\nWatch the leaked video where Mark Zuckerberg warned his inner circle about the potential harms of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThis video is from the Bit channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nChan Zuckerberg Institute funneled cash to Wuhan lab where covid likely originated.\n\nFB stands FOR BIDEN: Mark Zuckerberg’s $400M grant pushed for Democrat win.\n\nTyrant Mark Zuckerberg to SHAME unvaccinated people on Facebook by publicly labeling them\n\nMark Zuckerberg being sued for meddling in the 2020 election.\n\nSources include:\n\nNewsPunch.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nProjectVeritas.com\n\nAbout.FB.com 1\n\nAbout.FB.com 2\n\nTheGuardian.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Study reveals monkeypox virus was MANIPULATED in a lab and released intentionally to cause an outbreak\n\nData from a shocking study published by Portugal’s National Institute of Health (NIH) suggests that the monkeypox outbreak was intentional and that the virus was manipulated in a lab.\n\nWhen a person has monkeypox, they will usually get a fever before they develop a rash one to five days later. The rash will often appear on their face before spreading to other parts of the body. The rash then changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab that eventually falls off. If you’re infected, you are contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and the skin underneath is intact.\n\nMonkeypox has always been extremely rare and the disease was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries.\n\nBut it wasn’t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak was recorded in the United States. Monkeypox has never been recorded in multiple countries at the same time until this year.\n\nThis year’s cases of monkeypox have been recorded in the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. all at the same time.\n\nAs of July, the alleged number of cases in the U.K. has skyrocketed to 1,235.\n\nHowever, there’s something unusual about the outbreak, especially since the world is allegedly experiencing an outbreak across first-world countries all at the same time.\n\nBack in March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) collaborated with the Munich Security Conference (MSC) to run a tabletop exercise on reducing high-consequence biological threats. The exercise analyzed gaps in national and international biosecurity and pandemic preparedness architectures to find out possible opportunities to “improve prevention and response capabilities for high-consequence biological events.”\n\nThis is the scenario the NTI and the MSC conducted: A monkeypox outbreak that began on May 15 resulted in 3.2 billion cases and 271 million deaths by December 1, 2023.\n\nThe similarities are too close to reality and it would be unwise to consider the current monkeypox outbreak as an unusual coincidence, especially since the first cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 13.\n\nPortugal’s NIH suggests monkeypox outbreak may have been engineered\n\nFindings from the study conducted by Portugal’s NIH suggest that the current monkeypox outbreak may be engineered.\n\nFor the study, NIH researchers gathered specimens from nine patients with monkeypox between May 15 and May 17 of this year and analyzed them. Results revealed that the recent multi-country outbreak of monkeypox is probably the result of a single origin since all sequences of viruses released to date tightly cluster together.\n\nThe research team also reported that the virus belongs to the West African group of monkeypox viruses. Additionally, they discovered that the virus is most closely related to monkeypox viruses that were exported from Nigeria to several countries in 2018 and 2019, specifically the U.K., Israel and Singapore.\n\nThis is the first clue that shows how the latest outbreak may be the result of an engineered virus that leaked from a lab.\n\nThe second clue that the monkeypox virus was leaked from a lab is the fact that even though the virus closely resembles those exported from Nigeria, it is still different with more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nSNPs are genetic variations and the researchers explained that 50 SNPs are “far more than one would expect.” This implies that someone manipulated the monkeypox virus in a lab. (Related: Study finds monkeypox virus has been heavily manipulated in a lab.)\n\nDr. Robert Malone broke down the Portugal study in an op-ed piece published by Life Site News and concluded that the current monkeypox outbreak is indeed engineered. “This double stranded DNA virus, infections by which have historically been self-limiting, appears to be evolving to a form that is more readily transmitted from human to human. Bad news,” he wrote.\n\nVisit MonkeyPoxReport.com for more information about the monkeypox virus.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the monkeypox virus.\n\nThis video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nMonkeypox outbreak could be used to justify expansion of medical surveillance.\n\nMonkeypox release is PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM to keep humanity paralyzed with FEAR.\n\nSame Wuhan lab linked to covid recently tampered with monkeypox strains.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Governments that mandated deadly covid vaccines now blaming DOCTORS for not telling patients about the risks\n\nAfter becoming the first country in the world to mandate Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” on all citizens, Austria is now trying to shift responsibility onto doctors for all the health damage that resulted.\n\nAustrian Green Minister of Health Johannes Rauch says physicians, and not himself and his fellow politicians, are to blame for all the injuries and deaths because they failed to warn their patients about the risks involved with getting injected.\n\nNever mind the fact that these patients had no choice but to get them – and doctors were basically required to give them. In Rauch’s mind, it is someone else’s fault that thousands of Austrians are now dead or permanently injured because of the policies he helped create.\n\nThe SuperSpreader Substack is calling Rauch’s blame game the “most epic throwing under the bus to save your own a** of our generation” – and he is right. Not only is Rauch’s claim nonsensical, but it absolutely shows that the plandemic is crumbling to pieces at a rapid pace.\n\n“Anyone paying attention already understands that once the bodies start piling up the REAL fireworks will begin,” the “Mole” Substack adds.\n\n“We will see frantic finger pointing and rabid blame shifting. Screeching turned up to 11 competing with a word vomit of lies about who said what and when. It will be something spectacular to behold.”\n\nIf Austrian doctors had reported jab injuries, they would have lost their licenses\n\nIt turns out that there was never even a way for Austrian doctors to warn their patients about the risks involved, seeing as how those risks were concealed by politicians and their Big Pharma buddies who wanted the truth to be kept under wraps.\n\nNot only that, but doctors in Austria are not even allowed to report vaccine damage, even in suspected cases. This is due to “strict instructions from the medical association,” one person in the know tweeted.\n\n“Anyone who violates this is revoked the right to ordain,” the tweet further explains.\n\nNone of this was revealed by the corporate-controlled media, however. Headlines all around the world cited Rauch’s claim that the “medical profession” is to blame for covid jab injuries and deaths.\n\nOne headline declared that Rauch dropped a “liability hammer” by supposedly “confirming” that “doctors are responsible for vaccine damage” simply because they were the ones who were told to stick the injections into people’s arms, or else.\n\n“He seems to be trying to pull his own head out of the ever-tightening noose and to want to shirk responsibility,” one critical report said about Rauch’s shifting of blame.\n\n“Although he prescribes the ‘vaccinations,’ liability is shifted entirely to the medical profession.”\n\nDoctors face fines of up to 14,000 euros for covid “vaccine” injuries and deaths\n\nLaying blame on doctors is apparently not enough for Rauch. He also supports penalizing doctors up to 14,000 euros for their role in administering the jabs that caused many to become injured or die.\n\nEven though Austrian doctors basically had no choice in the matter, except to refuse and lose their medical licenses, Rauch stated that he is not responsible at all and that doctors need to pay a price.\n\n“The scope of medical education has been shown in the Austrian vaccination plan for years and I can assume that doctors work in accordance with the recommendations and the state of the art,” Rauch is quoted as saying, claiming innocence in the matter.\n\nIn essence, Rauch is saying that doctors should have avoided listening to him and instead done their own due diligence into the shots to see if they really were “safe and effective” like Rauch and others claimed.\n\n“The function of the information is to protect the freedom of decision of the person concerned,” one report explains. “This can be punished under administrative and / or disciplinary law as well as have consequences under liability law.”\n\nIf Rauch’s perspective becomes the Austrian government’s official position, then doctors all across that country could face lawsuits in the coming months and years over the role they apparently played in deceiving the masses into rolling up their sleeves for deadly “medicine.”\n\n“That is rich after their government even mulled a vax mandate for all adults and tried to silence all critics,” wrote a reader at the “Mole” Substack.\n\n“He’s right about the fact that medical doctors who failed to inform patients of the risks betrayed their medical responsibility,” suggested another. “However, a governing board that threatened the licenses of doctors who were true to their medical responsibilities are also to blame.”\n\nAnother also blamed the media for “just following orders” and reporting whatever the government and Big Pharma told them to.\n\n“This is all about good versus evil,” this person added. “And all will be judged.”\n\nThe latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” program can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nMole.substack.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Canada’s health minister says you will NEVER be “fully vaccinated” against covid, no matter how many vaccines you take\n\nCanadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos recently came clean about the government’s plan to mass inject the population every NINE months. He told reporters that the definition of fully-vaccinated “made no sense” because every person will eventually need to prove that they are “up-to-date” with the latest round of injections. He said that citizens will NEVER be “fully vaccinated” against covid, no matter how many vaccines they take.\n\nGovernments around the world are dutifully ordering millions of new covid-19 boosters for the Fall of 2022. The out-of-control corporate media will soon be advertising the covid-19 pandemic again and pushing for new vaccine mandates.\n\nThe situation is far from over. When asked if mandates would return in the Fall, Duclos replied, “We must continue to fight against Covid.” Those who bend their knee to medical tyranny now will be forced to take injections every nine months, until they die. It’s a cycle of control and sickness.\n\nCanadians should brace for deadly vaccine mandates every nine months\n\nJean-Yves Duclos said that people should start asking themselves, “So am I up-to-date in my vaccination? Have I received a vaccination in the last nine months?”\n\n“Nine months is very clear and will help people understand why ‘up to date’ is the right way to think about vaccination now,” Duclos said.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the government has decided to inject all adults (18 years of age and older) every THREE months. In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci has pushed for boosters every five months. The US FDA has already implemented the World Health Organization’s “Future Framework” which skips all clinical trials to automatically approve new boosters every year.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how many vaccines a person takes — whether its two, three, ten or one hundred — the government will always require another dose. It’s a system of enslavement, immune depletion and death. Every person, no matter their “vaccination status,” will ultimately be labeled an “anti-vaxxer” each time a new booster campaign is announced. This public humiliation tactic has been used repeatedly to shame people into compliance. People are made to feel isolated and alone if they do not go along with the narrative. The covid-19 vaccine program was always a psychopathic plot of pharmaceutical dependence, genetic enslavement to mRNA experiments, and ultimately a plan for accelerated depopulation.\n\nMedical ethics destroyed worldwide as pharmaceutical overlords demand perpetual obedience\n\nFirst and foremost, the mRNA “vaccine” platform was rolled out in violation of the Nuremberg Code. What we are witnessing today is an all-out assault on medical ethics and the informed consent principle. The deluge of covid-19 propaganda, coupled with coordinated acts of censorship, has allowed nefarious criminal forces to bribe, coerce, discriminate against, and restrain individuals, robbing them of their dignity. Many people have faced segregation and threats of starvation and have acted under duress in order to keep their jobs and livelihoods.\n\nAs corrupt world leaders threaten further vaccine mandates every nine months, individuals who were not killed by the weaponized vaccine lots will get another chance to stand up to their abusers and take their health and freedom back. Studies show that all vials are not the same. Adverse events are more prevalent in certain lots and may be 20-25 times more frequent in some lots compared to others.\n\nThis battle for the future of human rights and human health will go on, until more individuals speak up and stand their ground, demanding not only health freedom, but also justice against the perpetrators of mass murder and enslavement. It’s time for populations to unite in their newfound “unvaccinated” status and demand an end to all mandates and medical fraud. For there to be full restoration of medical ethics, there must be trials for all criminal misconduct, medical fraud, and mass murder.\n\nSources include:\n\nZerohedge.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nTobyRogers.substack.com\n\nNCBI.NLM.NIH.gov\n\nTrialsiteNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Pfizer classified nearly every severe adverse reaction during covid vaccine trials as “not related to shots”\n\nThe reason why Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” was declared to be “safe and effective” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is because Pfizer lied about the outcomes of its clinical trials.\n\nPfizer’s clinical trial documents, which started getting released on June 1 by the FDA as part of a lawsuit and court-ordered disclosure schedule, reveal that the company classified nearly every severe adverse event that occurred as being “not related to shots.”\n\nThe 80,000-page document pile from Pfizer includes an extensive set of Case Report Forms (CFRs) from the company’s Phase 3 trials, which were conducted at various locations throughout the United States.\n\n“The CRFs included in this month’s documents contain often vague explanations of the specific symptoms experienced by the trial participants,” writes Michael Nevradakis, PhD, for The Defender, a project of Children’s Health Defense (CHD).\n\n“They also reveal a trend of classifying almost all adverse events – and in particular severe adverse events (SAEs) – as being ‘not related’ to the vaccine.”\n\nJust like they did with covid itself, vaccine deaths were blamed on everything but the jabs themselves\n\nIn one instance, a woman in her 50s who participated in a Pfizer clinical trial at the Sterling Research Group in Cincinnati, Ohio, died of an apparent myocardial infarction on Nov. 4, 2020, after receiving two injections two months prior.\n\n“The patient had a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis of the knees and attention deficit disorder,” reports explain.\n\n“Her death was listed as ‘not related’ to the vaccine, and was instead attributed to ‘hypertensive cardiovascular disease.'”\n\nAnother female of roughly the same age, also out of Cincinnati, died of cardiac arrest on Oct. 21, 2020, after getting shot in the months prior. Her death was categorized as “not related” to the injections as it “occurred 2 months after last receipt of study agent.”\n\nA mid-60s male who participated in a Texas-based Ventavia Research Group trial got jabbed in August 2020 and died in November 2020 from an apparent myocardial infarction. His death was blamed on a “failed cardiac stent” and pneumonia attributed to an undisclosed “infection.”\n\nA fully injected teenage female who was diagnosed with right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis on Nov. 15, 2020, was hospitalized for her “serious” condition and later died, only to have Pfizer list the cause of death as a “fracture.”\n\nA male in his mid-70s who was jabbed around the same time and quickly developed abdominal adhesions, altered mental status, and acute hypoxic respiratory failure later died from congestive heart failure. His death was blamed by Pfizer on a “prior surgery.”\n\nAnother male of roughly the same age out of Boston received both Pfizer injections and developed pneumonia and a peripheral edema. He later died after being hospitalized for pneumonia, only to have his death attributed by Pfizer to “existing neuropathy.”\n\n“During his hospitalization with pneumonia, his blood pressure was measured as high as 179/72, with a heart rate reaching 105 beats per minute and an oxygen saturation level that fell to 92.0,” Nevradakis writes.\n\n“In total, he had three emergency room visits during the observation period.”\n\nOn and on the list goes with patient after patient clearly dying from the jabs, but not being categorized as such in Pfizer’s trial results. This is what you call fraud, and it is what Pfizer engaged in to participate in and profit from Operation Warp Speed.\n\n“Now are people understanding why this information was not supposed to be released for 70 years?” wrote a reader at The Defender. “They tried to bury this … After 70 years, everyone who had taken the ‘clot-shot’ would have been dead.”\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Israeli government hid childhood vaccine injuries during covid jab approval process\n\nIn approving Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” for children, the government of Israel hid data, we now know, showing that the shots are much deadlier for kids than they are for adults.\n\nRaw data compiled by Prof. Matti Berkowitz, director of the Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Unit at Assaf Harofeh Hospital (Shamir) reveals that children aged 5-11 experience twice as many adverse events, on average, compared to children in the 12-17 age group.\n\nThe injury rate for young children is even higher when compared to teenagers, says Dr. Yaffa Shir-Raz, a health and risk communication researcher at the University of Haifa and at Reichman University (IDC Herzliya). Based on the data, children 5-11 are up to six times more likely than teens to suffer jab injuries.\n\n“… the 2-dose immunization rate for 5-11 year olds is less than 18%, while older children have rates of 55-72% (3-4 times higher),” explains Eliyahu Tulshinski, writing for America’s Frontline News. (Related: Israel’s “booster” shot program is now endless.)\n\n“All things being equal, the young children would thus be expected to have 1/3-1/4 of the number of adverse events experienced by the older children, not twice as many. This means that the adverse event rate for young children is actually 6-8 times that of the older children, i.e., at 600-800% of the baseline injury rate!”\n\n“While there are slightly more children in the 5-11 year old group than in the 12-17 age group, it does not come close to accounting for the mind blowing rate increase in the younger group.”\n\nPfizer lied in corporate pamphlets about jab dangers\n\nIn early June, Berkowitz presented the findings to the Israeli Ministry of Health’s Department of Epidemiology, along with graphs depicting the data. Each injury was broken down by type, revealing several alarming truths that Pfizer conveniently left out of its leaflet on the injections.\n\nBerkowitz and her team identified and characterized a slew of neurological symptoms that were not previously known, including hypoesthesia (partial or complete decrease in skin sensitivity); paraesthesia (abnormal skin sensation such as numbness, tingling, stinging or burning), tinnitus, dizziness and more.\n\nAlso observed but not mentioned in the Pfizer materials were menstrual changes lasting a long time. Pfizer representatives claim that they have “no knowledge of long-term adverse events,” but Dr. Shir-Raz and colleagues found many of them.\n\nIn fact, 90 percent of jabbed women who developed such symptoms reported that they lasted in perpetuity – meaning they were not just a temporary reaction to the shots.\n\nThe data and graphs showing all this were eventually leaked, making their way into the hands of the Professional Ethics Front (PEF), an independent Israeli group of physicians, lawyers, scientists and researchers who “aim to address the ethical issues related to the COVID-19 crisis in Israeli society.”\n\nThis group penned a letter to the nation’s government explaining the findings and how children are being placed at needless risk of serious injury because of the shots.\n\nThe public should know about the data, the group further wrote in the letter, because to not release it represents “a blatant violation of parents’ right to informed consent, and because it constitutes gross negligence, and puts children and infants at risk.”\n\nIsrael’s State Comptroller is obligated under the law to respond to correspondences such as this, but that never happened. This prompted PEF to file a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) to get the data into the hands of the public another way: through citizen force.\n\nMore on all this and its implications is available at America’s Frontline News.\n\nYou will also find more of the latest news about Fauci Flu shots and their deadly side effects at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nAmericasFrontlineNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Hepatitis outbreak of unknown cause among children a direct result of AstraZeneca’s COVID “vaccine,” says virologist\n\nA respected virologist-immunologist has written a letter to the esteemed British Medical Journal (BMJ) explaining that a new outbreak of “acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children” is a direct result of AstraZeneca’s viral vector Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine.”\n\nMillions of children in the United Kingdom were injected with the poison, which an earlier study published in the Journal of Hepatology confirmed is causing many of them to develop severe liver damage – in some cases requiring an urgent liver transplant.\n\nDr. Ann-Cathrin Engwall said that adenovirus infections, which are present in 70 percent of affected children, could be the cause of acute hepatitis in children observed – even though adenovirus infections do not normally cause hepatitis in healthy children.\n\nThis strange phenomenon, she said, could point to “a completely new type of adenovirus that might have been introduced into the human population.”\n\n“A substantial proportion of the population in the U.K. has received Vaxzevria which is an adenovirus vector vaccine from AstraZeneca developed by the Jenner Institute in Oxford,” Dr. Engwall wrote in her letter, citing research on the subject.\n\n“The chimpanzee viral vector was selected due to the low herd immunity in the human population and originates from an adenovirus purified from the feces of chimpanzee cubs.”\n\nMad Franken-scientists think they are gods, and children are paying the price\n\nThe vector itself is genetically engineered, she went on to explain, noting that it cannot multiply on its own. This allows “genes of interest” to be added, which in the case of Vaxzevria is supposedly the DNA sequence expressing the spike protein from the original SARS-CoV-2.\n\n“Could the adenovirus vector vaccine have contributed to a new recombinant virus?” Dr. Engwall asked.\n\n“Even if the virus vector does not multiply, there is an obvious risk exposing such a large number of individuals that recombination with an adenovirus could occur.”\n\nIt turns out that a survival mechanism for adenoviruses known as multiplicity reactivation (MR) was discovered back in 1971 by Japanese researchers, who observed that damaged adenovirus genomes can interact with other adenoviruses in a cell to form a new viable viral genome.\n\n“The mechanism is described as an early variant of a reproductive (sexual) process that can occur in microorganisms,” Dr. Engwall explained. “A proportion of the population, especially individuals with a compromised immune system, is carrying latent adenoviruses.”\n\n“In Sweden, approximately 20 percent of adults and 50 percent of kindergarten children are carriers. This safety issue of viral-vector delivery systems was often discussed in the beginning of the development of these medical tools.”\n\nThe mass introduction of adenovirus vector vaccines on the heels of the plandemic represents a first in human history. Thus, the risk for recombination with adenoviruses is massively increased – which explains the sudden and seemingly out-of-nowhere appearance of hepatitis in fully-injected children.\n\nThe really sad thing is that if these viral vector injections are in fact the cause of acute hepatitis in children, then the symptoms they are experiencing now “could just be the tip of the iceberg,” Dr. Engwall warned.\n\n“The virus may have spread to other countries from the U.K., but it is also possible that adenovirus recombinations may have occurred independently elsewhere in the world where adenovirus vector vaccines also have been used,” she added in her letter.\n\n“Development of a new more pathogenic adenovirus could be caused by using adenovirus vector vaccines in large populations, and it is consistent with the facts available. To investigate this important safety issue of viral vector vaccines, sequencing of entire adenovirus genomes from cases and comparisons with the vaccine viral vector is necessary to verify or dismiss this hypothesis.”\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New York’s covid quarantine and isolation orders ruled unconstitutional\n\nAn effort by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, to grant herself unlimited power and authority to invoke isolation and quarantine measures whenever she feels like it has been struck down by a state Supreme Court judge.\n\nJustice Ronald Ploetz decided that Hochul’s plan is unlawful and unconstitutional, ruling that involuntary detention like the kinds Hochul craves “is a severe deprivation of individual liberty.”\n\nHochul’s provision, dubbed Rule 2.13, comes with no scientific data or expert testimony on why it is necessary, Ploetz said. Instead, all it does is “provide a quick and nimble approach” for Hochul to deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights on a whim. (Related: New York also waged economic warfare against the unvaccinated.)\n\n“Involuntary quarantine may have far-reaching consequences such as loss of income (or employment) and isolation from family,” Ploetz said, calling Rule 2.13 even “more egregious” than mask mandates, which are also tyrannical and unsubstantiated by science.\n\nRule 2.13, entitled “Isolation and Quarantine Procedures,” reads as follows:\n\n“Whenever appropriate to control the spread of a highly contagious communicable disease, the State Commissioner of Health may issue and / or may direct the local health authority to issue isolation and / or quarantine orders, consistent with due process of law, to all such persons as the State Commissioner of Health shall determine appropriate.”\n\nThe rule also would have granted health authorities the jurisdiction to “monitor” New Yorkers to ensure that they remain in constant compliance with Hochul’s demands. Hochul would then have been able to decide arbitrarily whether or not an individual “requires a higher level of medical care,” meaning more tyranny.\n\nIllness is not an excuse for the government to trample the Constitution\n\nAfter Hochul filed her proposed rule, state Sen. George Borrello along with two Republican state Assembly members and NYS United filed a lawsuit against both Hochul and state health commissioner Mary Bassett.\n\n“They argued that the rule lacked due process, and gave authorities too much discretion when deciding who should be placed in quarantine,” reported The Post Millennial.\n\nIt turns out that Section 2120 of the state’s Public Health Law requires that an “independent magistrate” decide on the terms of detention, not some rogue governor like Hochul.\n\nContrary to how it might sound, the state Supreme Court of New York is actually not the “highest court in the land.” Strangely, New York law places the Supreme Court of that state at the bottom of the judicial system. The Court of Appeals holds the top spot.\n\nConcerning New York’s jab mandates, a commenter at Natural News pointed to the case of Friend v. City of Gainesville, which was a success in Florida thanks to the 1905 Supreme Court case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts.\n\nIt takes time and work, but lawsuits such as these, as well as the latest one in New York, are necessary to stem the tide of tyranny that is spreading over the land under the guise of fighting a “pandemic.”\n\nThe government does not have any right to violate the Constitution simply because there is a sickness supposedly going around.\n\n“To free yourself from evil you must find the moral courage to remove the perpetrators of evil,” another commenter wrote, touching on this from a slightly different perspective.\n\n“Then and only then is a quaint and peaceful life lived in pursuit of the things that drive each and every one of us in our numerous endeavors throughout a harmonious life possible.”\n\nSomeone else added that Americans really need to step it up so that these “fake people in our government who are killing Americans” are not successful in their tyrannical agenda.\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nThePostMillennial.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "As Boris Johnson resigned, UK officials quietly released data showing that covid death rate is highest among fully vaccinated\n\nJust hours before now-former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned from his post on July 7, the British government quietly and strategically dropped a major bombshell confirming that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” are not saving lives.\n\nSince at least April of this year, the “fully vaccinated” population of England accounts for the vast majority of deaths that are being blamed on “covid” – this in terms of deaths per 100,000 people, which is how the data is presented.\n\nWhile the unvaccinated are mostly doing just fine, going about their lives with normal health, those who took all the jabs in obedience to Johnson’s regime are dropping like flies, probably due to vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).\n\nAs you may recall, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced back in March that starting on April Fool’s Day, it would no longer be publishing the vaccination status of covid cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. Now we know why they did this. (Related: the UKHSA also deleted a study from its official reporting that linked covid injections to increased risk of infection.)\n\n“At the time, the UKHSA claimed this was because the UK Government had ended free universal Covid-19 testing and this, therefore, affected their ‘ability to robustly monitor Covid-19 cases by vaccination status,'” reports Exposé News.\n\n“However, this was a lie.”\n\nFauci Flu shots increase a person’s risk of death from “covid,” data shows\n\nAs the UKHSA was fudging the numbers and changing its reporting standards, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), another British government agency, published a report of its own outlining deaths by vaccination status in England. That report showed that England’s vaccinated population accounted for a whopping 94 percent of deaths between April 1 and May 31.\n\nOnce again, it becomes abundantly clear why the UKHSA changed its reporting requirements starting on April 1: because the data shows, without a shadow of a doubt, that covid injections are killing people, not protecting them.\n\n“… now we can also reveal that this is not because the majority of people have been vaccinated, which in turn statistically results in more deaths,” Exposé News further reported.\n\n“It is instead, as the ONS data shows, because the Covid-19 injections are increasing recipients’ risk of death if infected with Covid-19.”\n\nUsing Pfizer’s own vaccine efficacy formula, it can be further shown from official UK data that getting injected for covid has a negative effectiveness against death, meaning a person is more likely to die if he or she gets jabbed as opposed to just leaving natural immunity intact.\n\nThe Pfizer documents, which a court order forced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to release against the agency’s will, further show that the mRNA (messenger RNA) injections from both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna induce ADE, which causes natural immunity to wane over time, much like AIDS.\n\nBecause of this, many now refer to the immune degradation that occurs post-injection for covid as VAIDS, or vaccine-induced AIDS, as it bears many of the same hallmarks as traditional AIDS – though mechanistically the action of immune destruction is different.\n\n“ADE can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the ‘Trojan Horse Pathway,'” Exposé News further explains. “This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies generated by past infection or vaccination fail to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure.”\n\n“Instead, they act as a gateway by allowing the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off-limits (typically immune cells, like macrophages). That, in turn, can lead to wider dissemination of illness, and over-reactive immune responses that cause more severe illness.”\n\nFauci Flu shots are a death sentence for many.

        "DEATH SHOTS: Canadian data show that COVID “vaccines” INCREASE the risk of death from covid\n\nNot only does Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) not protect against COVID, but official government data from the Canadian province of Manitoba show that the shots actually increase a person’s risk of death.\n\nThe latest figures available for May show that only nine percent of deaths and 14 percent of hospital admissions in the province were unvaccinated people, despite them representing 17 percent of the population.\n\nAn analysis of the data further shows that vaccinated, but unboosted people are about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die from covid compared to unvaccinated people (Related: Last summer, the Canadian government forced people to get injected in order to travel).\n\n“People who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated,” notes Alex Berenson about the data.\n\nTwo illustrative charts, which you can view on Berenson’s Substack, show that hospitalizations and deaths are most prominent among the fully jabbed, all things considered.\n\n“These figures and estimates differ markedly from those the Centers for Disease Control have provided for American COVID deaths,” Berenson further writes. “But they are likely to be far more accurate.”\n\n“American hospitals and health authorities classify COVID deaths and hospitalizations as occurring in the unvaccinated until proven otherwise.”\n\nHow many lives have been lost BECAUSE of covid vaccines?\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the American data collection model is that it relies on self-reporting within a system of privatized insurance. In Canada and elsewhere with nationalized health insurance, jab registries can more easily be matched against hospital admissions and deaths.\n\nIn every country where nationalized health care exists, it is obvious from the data that far more “fully vaccinated” people than unvaccinated people are getting sick and dying from what they are calling covid.\n\n“Still, the data from Manitoba appear to mark the first time that any government agency has actually found a higher risk of death in vaccinated people,” Berenson notes.\n\nThe Manitoba data fully implicate Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for crimes against humanity, seeing as how he was the ringleader in that country for mass injection.\n\n“When will Canadian citizens demand that Trudeau is arrested, tried and executed for blatant violations of the Nuremburg Code?” asked one of Berenson’s subscribers. “When will we all stop soft-pedaling genocide by globalist parasites?\n\nKeep in mind that Trudeau, like most politicians, is just a figurehead puppet who likely takes orders from some invisible entity far up above him. And they deserve the same prosecutorial treatment as he does.\n\n“They just approved the shots for children,” added another commenter about how the mass injection campaign is now targeting babies. “Where the FDA goes, Health Canada follows like the little corrupted lapdogs they are.”\n\n“It’s criminal to give these shots to babies and kids,” interjected someone else.\n\nSomeone else quoted Luke 17:1-2, which reads, citing the words of Jesus Christ himself:\n\n“Then said He unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone was hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones.”\n\nIf those who perpetrated and continue to perpetrate these crimes against humanity do not repent, then they deserve “nothing but incomprehensible, ineffable, unfathomable and unimaginable misery, pain, suffering, torment, wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Lake of Fire where the worm dies not and the fires are NEVER quenched,” this same commenter added, receiving an “Amen to that!” from another.\n\nThe latest news about the death toll from Fauci Flu shots can be found at Genocide.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nAlexBerenson.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Nearly all of the government’s COVID information websites are secret SPYING operations\n\nEuropean researchers put together a study revealing that government-run Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) information websites are a privacy-invading nightmare – let the public beware!\n\nEntitled “Measuring Web Cookies in Governmental Websites,” the paper, which was funded by the European Research Council (ERC), the European Union (EU), and the Spanish government, explains that government websites are basically being used as “a single point of monitoring and tracking for the entire population of a country” using web cookies.\n\nResearchers looked at three different types of websites, including the official governmental websites of “G20” countries around the world; websites of international organizations such as the United Nations; and popular websites used by the public for Fauci Flu tracking and information. They looked at each site’s use of cookies and came to the conclusion that upwards of 90 percent of government websites “create cookies of third-party trackers without any consent from users.”\n\n“Web cookies have been exploited to collect information about users’ online activities and interests,” the paper explains (Related: The Transportation Security Administration [TSA] also spies on air travelers).\n\n“Non-session cookies, that are created by trackers and can last for days or months, are widely present even in countries with strict user privacy laws. We also show that the above is a problem for official websites of international organizations and popular websites that inform the public about the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nHere’s a tip: don’t visit any government COVID websites in the first place and you won’t be tracked\n\nThe world’s largest economies, in other words, are engaging in undisclosed and potentially illegal spying and surveillance schemes via official government websites that the public uses to learn about COVID and engage in other forms of propaganda consumption.\n\nOf the 5,550 governmental websites and more than 118,000 URLs administrated by governments, more than 50 percent of their cookies belong to third parties, while anywhere from 10-90 percent originates from known trackers.\n\n“Most of these cookies have a life span of more than a day and many an expiration time of a year or more,” the study reveals.\n\nRoughly 60 percent of government websites use at least one third-party cookie while 95 percent, or nearly all, of them, are creating cookies without user consent. Third-party cookies, by the way, are “known to be tracking users for data collection purposes,” the study explains.\n\nGovernment websites about the Chinese Virus are the worst offenders, as 99 percent contain hidden cookies that were placed there without user consent.\n\n“For example, the very popular website with global maps about the COVID-19 cases, maintained by Johns Hopkins University, add cookies from 7 trackers,” the paper further reads.\n\n“All the other Top 10 websites are official national information websites in European countries that have three trackers or more. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also in the Top 10, with cookies associated with three trackers.”\n\nIt used to be that this type of thing only occurred in overtly communist countries such as China, which leads the way in totalitarianism. As of late, however, the United States and other Western powers appear to be emulating the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) model by imposing “social credit score”-type systems in their respective countries.\n\nThe Fauci Flu quickly became a catchall excuse to invade people’s privacy, force certain restrictive behaviors, and even commit medical rape in the form of mandatory masking and “vaccination.”\n\nIt turns out that even on the web the government is violating people’s rights and tracking their behavior without permission. The full scope of why the government wants to track people’s online behavior has yet to come into view.\n\nMore related news can be found at BigGovernment.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheNationalPulse.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New COVID-19 vaccines will be designed for “immune imprinting,” leading to more vaccinated people getting sick and dying\n\nThe next batch of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines developed by Big Pharma companies will be perfectly designed to drive “immune imprinting,” leading to more sicknesses and deaths of people who take new and experimental vaccines.\n\nThis was according to Dr. Robert Malone, who discussed immune imprinting during an appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room.” This followed President Joe Biden’s approval of a new $3.2 billion deal with Big Pharma company Pfizer for new COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThese new vaccines are “retooled” supposedly to better deal with the post-vaccine omicron variant. But Malone argued the new vaccines will be “perfectly designed to drive immune imprinting and make people even more susceptible to infection.”\n\nImmune imprinting is a phenomenon that occurs when a person is exposed to the proteins or other biological structures of viruses that allow them to penetrate host cells and cause infections, like those found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease.\n\nTheoretically, when an immune system has been successfully imprinted, the body will then have the ability to recall existing memory cells – immune system cells that “remember” the same pathogen – and provide the body with faster future antibody production when confronted with the disease. (Related: European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system.)\n\nImmune imprinting leaves people vulnerable to other illnesses\n\n“Immune imprinting is basically why a lot of people are susceptible to dying of other things,” commented Ben Armstrong during an episode of his program, “The Ben Armstrong Show.”\n\n“It’s pushing your immune system to basically concentrate on one thing, which would be whatever they’re jabbing you with,” said Armstrong. “The new jab, if it’s perfectly designed, sounds like it would make you focus even more so just on that [disease], leaving you even more open to other illnesses.”\n\nArmstrong also warns that immune imprinting vaccines are unlikely to protect people against different variants of the same disease the vaccine is supposedly meant to defend people against.\n\nSteve Brozak and Richard Marfuggi, writing for STAT News about immune imprinting, noted that current studies suggest that imprinting is just as likely to result in reduced responses to variants of the same disease as it is to provide the body with enhanced responses, and the clinical consequences of immune imprinting are still unknown.\n\nFurthermore, they warn of the potential dangers of imprinting immature immune systems, such as those of infants and toddlers.\n\n“The immune systems of infants and toddlers – the targets of the latest COVID-19 vaccination approval – are immature and developing,” they wrote.\n\n“If an immature immune system is immunologically imprinted, either by acute infection from the currently circulating viral variant or by a COVID-19 vaccine based on the original, wild-type variant that is no longer in circulation, it may fail to develop appropriate defenses when confronted – even years later – by a COVID variant or another totally different pathogen.”\n\nLearn more about the experimental and dangerous vaccines at DangerousMedicine.com.\n\nWatch this episode of “The Ben Armstrong Show” as host Ben Armstrong talks about immune imprinting.\n\nThis video is from the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nQatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.\n\nThe more vaccines you take, the weaker your immune system becomes.\n\nUK government data proves COVID-19 vaccines continue to damage immune systems over time, creating vaccine-induced “AIDS.”\n\nPfizer admits in confidential document that COVID-19 vaccine causes Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (same thing as Antibody Dependent Enhancement).\n\nVaccine expert: Giving COVID-19 vaccines to children is an unforgivable sin because they destroy children’s innate immune systems.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nStatNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Calgary firefighters file $38 million lawsuit against city and fire department over covid “vaccine” mandates\n\nNineteen firefighters in Calgary who were fired for refusing Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” are now suing the department and the city for $38 million in damages.\n\nPlaintiffs say the Canadian city’s injection mandate “violated” their basic “human rights” by forcing them to alter their DNA in order to continue working and making a living.\n\n“There’s something tyrannical about these mandates,” says Stephen Dabbagh, the lawsuit’s leader. (Related: Canada’s covid jab mandate is why the trucker caravans were formed.)\n\n“We can’t identity everybody behind it, but what we can do is hold people accountable, like the fire chief, politicians, city managers. Those people are responsible for their actions.”\n\nDabbagh had worked as a firefighter at the Calgary Fire Department (CFD) for some 20 years, including most recently as a fire captain. He reportedly resigned under duress on Dec. 8, 2021 after being told that he had to take the jab.\n\nUnwilling to let that stand without a fight, Dabbagh and 18 of his colleagues banded together to try to stop the “political and ideological tyranny of these mandates.”\n\n“It’s about trying to hold people (politicians, bureaucrats) accountable for their actions,” Dabbagh told LifeSiteNews.\n\nThe suit’s Statement of Claim was delivered to the City of Calgary and CFD on July 7 in the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta.\n\nMore lawsuits like this need to be filed\n\nA portion of the suit, $2 million, aims to cover damages for mental duress and violations of the firefighters’ Charter rights under the Criminal Code for “Punitive and exemplary damages.”\n\n“By forcing its loyal employees to take experimental injections as a requisite to employment, the City has breached its legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to its Employees contrary to section 217.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada,” the lawsuit reads.\n\n“The Plaintiffs have suffered measurable damages, including mental distress, anxiety, and, in particular, injury to dignity and self-respect. The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to significant damages due to the manner in which the City suspended their employment, including a claim for punitive aggravated damages arising from flagrant human rights and Charter violations.”\n\nAll city employees in Calgary, including firefighters, were told back in the fall of 2021 that they had to get jabbed for the Fauci Flu and show proof of it or else submit to constant “testing,” which involves an invasive cotton swab being shoved up the nose.\n\nThere were also limited exemptions available, though not many qualified for those.\n\nIn March of 2022, Calgary’s covid jab mandate was “suspended,” but it was already too late for Dabbagh and his colleagues. Their goal now is to get paid for what they had to endure, as well as to stop this type of tyranny from ever being imposed again.\n\n“The law says we have these rights (to refuse the jabs via Canada’s Charter) even if they are not being upheld by the courts,” Dabbagh says.\n\n“For me, it is using every avenue to fight against the political and ideology tyranny of these mandates … These medications, or whatever they are called, are not safe and did not work.”\n\nNearly all of the firefighters named in the suit have worked as city firefighters for a long time. One of them was fired simply for showing support for the Freedom Convoy, which is a violation of rights all on its own.\n\nSome of the firefighters have returned to work but under duress. They are still named in the lawsuit because their human rights have been impacted, and “even people who were on leave at the time have still suffered human rights violations,” says Alberta lawyer Leighton Gray, who is representing the firefighters in the case.\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at Immunization.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "STUDY: Natural immunity to covid never wanes, but fully jabbed are developing AIDS\n\nEvery person who left his immune system alone now has permanent immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), a new study has found. But every person who got “vaccinated” now has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, also known as AIDS.\n\nResearchers in Qatar looked at data from the Qatari National digital-health information platform, which covers the country’s entire population. Nearly 90 percent of the country is expatriates from over 150 countries, so the data is expansive.\n\nThey determined from this data that everyone in the country who tested “positive” for covid and later recovered still has the same amount of immunity to the disease. Not even one percent of their natural immunity waned.\n\nConversely, everyone in the country who took the jabs like Tony Fauci and Rochelle Walensky told them to is now in a developing state of immune degradation. Over time, the “fully vaccinated,” as they call them, are losing their ability to fight off any kind of disease, including covid.\n\nThe paper in its entirety is available for viewing and analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n“So natural immunity provides non waning 97.3% long term protection against severe, critical or fatal infection for at least 14 months and by extrapolation – indefinitely,” reported Exposé News, which analyzed the findings.\n\n“Whereas mRNA vaccine immunity wanes to 55.6% at some time after 7 months. Perhaps around 12 months?”\n\nThere’s a reason why nobody in the industry wants to talk about vaccine effectiveness after six months\n\nThe new findings corroborate with earlier ones concerning the development of vaccine-induced AIDS, or VAIDS, in people who take the jabs.\n\nIt appears that the more people get injected for the Chinese Virus, the worse off their immune systems become at fighting it off. Meanwhile, those who skipped the jabs are generally in good health with normal, fully functioning immunity.\n\nThe Exposé, which focuses primarily on data out of the United Kingdom, has been saying for a while now that the fully jabbed are more prone to getting sick and dying while the unvaccinated have long since moved on from all the covid hysteria. This new Qatari paper only further supports that narrative.\n\nMost of the scrutiny for the jabs, which is slim to begin with, only looks at their immediate impact. If a person seems fine in the days or weeks following injection, then they are declared to be a success – but what about the effects after, say, six months?\n\nNobody seems to want to talk about that because the data almost universally shows that vaccine effectiveness quickly turns negative. This means that over time, immune function wanes to the point that “boosters” are needed in order for a person to continue living.\n\nEarly warnings about VAIDS were shrugged off as a wild conspiracy theory, but now it is becoming clear that fully jabbed people have to continue getting jabbed if they want to live – otherwise there is a good chance that they will die upon exposure to anything, including the common cold.\n\nThe timeline for immune degradation will vary from person to person, but once it runs its course it seems to be game over for those who believed Fauci and Walensky and obeyed their commands.\n\n“We predicted in October of 2021 that vaccinated people would have VAIDS by the end of the year,” the Exposé says. “We deduced that from the 5% increase in initial infection rates in the doubly vaccinated every week compared to the unvaccinated.”\n\n“The results of this type of VAIDS have been these ridiculous surges in Covid19 infections right in the middle of summer when people do not normally get the flu. What the Qatari data shows, and what any trained virologist or immunologist is taught ab initio, is that acquired immunity does not wane (other than through HIV or some immune disorder).”\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nNEJM.org\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Thousands of non-COVID excess deaths in the UK likely caused by COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe latest data from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) has raised a lot of questions due to the sudden appearance of over 8,750 excess deaths from causes other than the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), with many questioning whether the vaccines caused these deaths.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the government received reports of 10,357 registered deaths in the week ending on July 1. This represents 1,128 – or 12.2 percent – more deaths above the five-year average. Of these deaths, only 332 were registered with COVID-19 as a contributory cause and 212 were registered with COVID-19 as the underlying cause. The remaining 916 excess deaths were not officially attributed to COVID-19.\n\nThis brings the total non-COVID-19 excess deaths in England and Wales in the 10 weeks since the recent coronavirus spike in late April to 8,756 deaths. (Related: European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system.)\n\nExperts who have noticed this spike in excess deaths have called for an urgent investigation to figure out what is causing this alarming trend.\n\nThe experts have also noted that there is a strong correlation between the rise in deaths and the beginning of the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine doses during the government’s spring booster campaign among people over the age of 75 in England. They believe this connection needs to be investigated.\n\nBut the British government has yet to signal an intent to conduct investigation or even offer any kind of explanation regarding the high rate of excess deaths. The total number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths in the U.K. is decreasing, meaning that the current wave – likely due to the vaccines – is easing.\n\nONS data shows over 200,000 deaths allegedly due to COVID-19\n\nThe latest data from the ONS shows that more than 200,000 people in the U.K. have allegedly died due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began in early 2020. This monumental mark was reached on June 25, but was only confirmed recently due to the time it takes for deaths to be registered with the statistics office.\n\nThe British government is admitting these deaths while at the same time boasting about the fact that the U.K. has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 75 percent of the population fully vaccinated and 60 percent boosted.\n\nThe registered deaths – totaling 200,247 deaths – were only counted if COVID-19 was mentioned on their death certificates, either as a main cause of death or a contributory factor. This strongly suggests that the British government may be hiding more deaths either due to COVID-19 or due to the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a lobbying group, called the breaching of the 200,000 mark “a tragedy” and “damning” evidence of the British government’s failure to properly handle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDr. Michael Head, senior research fellow for global health at the University of Southampton, said that the “vast majority” of the more than 200,000 deaths were preventable, but they occurred due to policy failures at the national level.\n\n“It’s important to remember that, for every death, there will be many more hospitalizations, long COVID and other indirect burdens such as greater impact on other areas of the U.K. health service and socioeconomic consequences such as bereavements and inability to work,” said Head. “Recorded COVID-19 deaths are the tip of a very unpleasant and far-reaching iceberg.”\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this video of David Icke explaining how the so-called “emerging diseases” are a way to cover up COVID-19 vaccine injuries and deaths.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nCanadian study confirms mRNA vaccines increase risk of myocarditis, especially in young men after second dose.\n\nQatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.\n\nHong Kong medical experts find evidence suggesting COVID-19 vaccines cause heart disease.\n\nThe late Dr. Zev Zelenko: COVID-19 vaccines were meant to keep people in state of mass psychosis.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: COVID-19 should be fought with early intervention, not vaccines.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nONS.gov.uk\n\nIndependent.co.uk\n\nNYTimes.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "European Medicines Agency adds SEVERE allergic reaction to Novavax COVID shot’s side effects\n\nThe European Union’s regulator for medicines added severe allergic reaction to the list of side effects caused by the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine from Novavax.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a July 14 update: “The product information of [the] Nuvaxovid [vaccine] will be updated with severe allergic reaction and unusual or decreased feeling in the skin as new side effects.” It added that following the assessment of the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, “anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) will be included in the EU product information as a side effect of Nuvaxovid.”\n\nAccording to the EMA, “a few cases” of anaphylaxis linked to the Novavax shot were reported – but the regulator refused to disclose the actual figure.\n\n“Generally, cases reported spontaneously by a patient or healthcare professional concern suspected side effects – i.e. medical events that have been observed after vaccination – but which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine.”\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted the Maryland-based vaccine maker for comment, but did not receive a response as of writing.\n\nAccording to The COVID Blog, the Novavax sub-unit protein vaccine delivers the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an insect virus. It also utilizes saponin from the soap bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) native to South America to trigger an immune response in the body.\n\nFDA grants EUA for the Novavax vaccine despite cardiac inflammation warning\n\nMeanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine on July 13.\n\n“Authorizing an additional vaccine expands the available vaccine options for the prevention of COVID-19, including the most severe outcomes that can occur such as hospitalization and death,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. He added that the EUA gives people another vaccine choice that meets the agency’s “rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.”\n\nThe July 13 EUA issued by the regulator permitted the use of the two-dose vaccine, with an interval of several weeks, on adults aged 18 and up. In petitioning the FDA for an EUA, Novavax said it would market its vaccine to individuals who did not want to get the COVID-19 vaccines already authorized in the United States. Currently, the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and the single-dose adenoviral vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson are authorized for use.\n\nThe vaccine’s product label in the U.S. warned against injecting it to people with a history of allergic reactions to any of its components. But even before it was granted EUA, staffers at the FDA pointed out that the vaccine increased the risk of myocarditis. (Related: FDA warns of CARDIAC INFLAMMATION risk linked to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.)\n\nIn documents released June 3, staff members at the regulator cited four events of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – that occurred during clinical trials of the vaccine. Novavax conducted trials of its sub-unit protein vaccine on almost 30,000 patients between December 2020 and September 2021.\n\n“These events raise the concern for a causal association with this vaccine, similar to the association documents with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,” they noted.\n\n“Data from passive surveillance during post-authorization use in other countries also indicate a higher than expected rate of myocarditis and pericarditis [heart lining inflammation] … associated with the vaccine. Further evaluation is needed to inform the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, and their outcomes, as additional data emerge over time.”\n\nWatch the video below as Dr. Jane Ruby warns against the dangers of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the Truth or Consequences channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nIMPOSSIBLE SCIENCE: Novavax says it will have a new “vaccine” ready in just two weeks for the “Omicron” variant, which appeared just last week.\n\nOperation Warp Speed gives $1.6 billion in taxpayer funding to Novavax for coronavirus vaccines.\n\n3 Aussie women experience SERIOUS REACTIONS after getting Novavax COVID shot.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nEMA.Europa.eu [PDF]\n\nTheCOVIDBlog.com\n\nFDA.gov 1\n\nFDA.gov 2\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA grants full approval to untested Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to Pfizer’s Comirnaty Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 years old.\n\nIn a press release, the FDA said the approval followed a “rigorous analysis and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data,” and that the vaccine “has been, and will continue to be, authorized for emergency use in this age group since May 2021.”\n\nHowever, the vaccine is not yet available in the U.S. for any age group as it is not the same formula as the Pfizer vaccine that has been authorized for use under the EUA and distributed as “fully approved.”\n\nMary Holland, the president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said the approval of Comirnaty for adolescents as young as 12 is “head-spinning.” (Related: Pfizer, FDA knew their COVID vaccine causes immunosuppression, ADE, VAED.)\n\n“The FDA failed to convene an expert committee and failed to appropriately weigh the risk-benefit profile of this vaccine for this age group,” Holland noted. “Even vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit acknowledged FDA decisions are being made based on political pressure, not science. When commenting on the agency’s vote last week to allow reformulated booster shots, he said it felt like ‘the fix was in.'”\n\nSome states will also likely attempt to put the vaccine on the childhood vaccine schedule despite unknown risks.\n\nComirnaty to receive liability protection when added to CDC’s immunization schedule\n\nWhile the Comirnaty vaccine can be mandated, it has no liability shield, which means that vials of the branded product that say Comirnaty on the label are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products. Only vaccines distributed under EUA have liability protection under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act (PREP).\n\nBut Comirnaty can receive liability protection when it is fully approved for children and added to the CDC’s immunization schedule, bringing it under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n\nHolland said Pfizer’s fraud and collusion with the government are becoming more evident: CHD is already challenging the EUA for children ages six months to 11, and will also be at the forefront of challenging this same authorization for adolescents and teens.\n\nFor its part, Pfizer said the approval is based on data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of 2,260 participants ages 12 through 15, and about half of the participants elicited neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) that demonstrate “strong immunogenicity in a subset of adolescents one month after the second dose.”\n\nIt is yet unknown what happens to antibody levels after one month, but peer-reviewed research suggests that protection after second and third doses of the vaccine wanes rapidly against the omicron variant.\n\nPfizer used an old analysis of 16 to 25-year-olds conducted before the delta and omicron surges, with an efficacy analysis conducted between November 2020 and May 2021.\n\nThe company admitted in its own press release that “only SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern identified from the confirmed COVID-19 cases in this age group was alpha.”\n\nMeanwhile, FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) said in its June 28 meeting that vaccine experts raised concerns that neutralizing antibodies did not correlate to clinical protection, noting that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine had a twofold increase in neutralizing antibody levels compared to that of Pfizer’s during the trials, but it still did not translate into a clinically significant difference in terms of protection against severe diseases.\n\nWatch the video below exposing how the vaccine advisory committee lied to get FDA approval for babies.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nPfizer tells federal judge that Pfizer owns the federal government and is thereby immune to normal contract law.\n\nNew York back in high risk category as “worst” omicron subvariant ravages the state.\n\nNearly 8,000 non-COVID excess deaths in UK traced to COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots.\n\nFather’s 20-year battle on behalf of vaccine-injured son exposes travesty of liability-free vaccines.\n\nFDA uses fraudulent data to justify pushing covid shots on infants and toddlers.\n\nSources include:\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org\n\nJAMANetwork.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Masking theory debunked: New study shows face coverings did LITTLE to mitigate spread of COVID\n\nA pre-print study concerning two adjacent North Dakota school districts found that there are no significant differences in COVID cases between those that mandate masks and those that don’t.\n\nFunded by the University of Southern California, the study noted that the randomized data about the effectiveness of mask mandates in children is still lacking. Researchers noted that while observational studies on school mask mandates showed conflicting results, randomized studies have failed to detect the impact of masking on participants under 50 years of age.\n\nThey used a “unique natural experiment to study school-based mask mandates” by analyzing data from two Fargo, North Dakota school districts: Fargo Public Schools (FPS) and West Fargo Public Schools (WF). Both districts have very similar demographics, with WF having slightly higher percentages of minority and low-income families.\n\nBoth districts had similar COVID-19 mitigation policies, testing options and staff vaccination rates, although FPS had stricter rules for quarantining close contacts of COVID-positive students.\n\nThe only significant difference between the district’s approach to the virus was that at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year, FPS required its students to be masked throughout the day, while WF did not. On January 17, FPS also made masks optional. This allowed researchers to compare the case rates when the districts had different policies and when they had the same. (Related: Yale professor scoffs at the idea that mask mandates are based on science.)\n\nThey found that from Aug. 26, 2021, to Jan. 17, 2022, the cumulative incidence in the mask-compulsory school district (12.9 percent) was almost identical to the cumulative incidence in the mask-optional district (13 percent).\n\nPost-Jan. 17, when both districts had mask-optional policies, case rates were also not significantly different – with FPS having a 5.3 percent rate and WF having 5.1 percent.\n\nThe researchers stated that the K-12 school mask mandates were not associated with significantly lower COVID-19 student case rates, which is consistent with adult randomized data on community cloth masking, multiple observational studies of school mask mandates and a systematic review of medical or surgical cloth masking for influenza.\n\nThey posited that studies of school-based mask mandates are particularly prone to bias as cases detected within the student population may be at least 20 times more likely to have been contracted outside of school than in. Other observational studies also reported a negative association between mask mandates and COVID cases, although there may have been important methodological limitations to the studies as well. (Related: Medical professionals, students decry mask mandates and other Covid measures in schools.)\n\nStudy has strengths not seen in randomized trials\n\nThe study was not a randomized trial, but it did have its strengths. For instance, the two school districts have similarities and there’s a “relatively long study period” with data from both the delta and omicron waves of the COVID-19. It also has “partial crossover” data for when FPS dropped its own mask mandate.\n\nWhile there are no official data on the masking rates in either district, parents and administrators told the researchers that masking was near-universal in the district with a mask mandate and five percent or less in the district where it is optional.\n\nThus, the researchers concluded that the school mask mandates were not associated with significantly lower COVID-19 case rates. They added that their findings are consistent with a growing body of scientific literature that should be taken into consideration and weighed with the harms and discomfort of masking in an educational setting.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), meanwhile, admitted in its own study from 2020 that the 21 percent lower incidence in schools that required mask use among students was not statistically significant compared with schools where mask use was optional. For their study, the CDC analyzed some 90,000 students in 169 Georgia elementary schools in November and December.\n\nHowever, the CDC buried its findings and chose not to include them in the report’s summary. University of California, San Francisco professor Vinay Prasad commented that the masking requirement for students failed to show that independent benefit is of great interest. “It should have been included in the summary,” he said.\n\nStill, evidence continues to grow suggesting that the mask mandates are not effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWatch Anthony Fauci admits mask mandates are about preserving authority over people.\n\nThis video is from the TruthParadigm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nNewsweek op-ed written by Yale professor blasts fake news media, leftist politicians for rejecting hydroxychloroquine.\n\nHarvard professor urges parents not to give children coronavirus vaccines because “risks outweigh any benefit.”\n\nAt least half of new coronavirus infections now happening in vaccinated people as “vaccine failure” phenomenon worsens.\n\nIt’s dangerous to ignore proof that hydroxychloroquine can save high-risk patients’ lives, doctor warns.\n\nYale doctor calls out CDC for committing large scale medical fraud and hiding covid cases among the vaccinated.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheNewAmerican.com\n\nResearchSquare.com\n\nCDC.gov\n\nTheMaineWire.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA’s “future framework” can let Big Pharma bypass testing for vaccine efficacy and safety\n\nThe influence of drug giants like Pfizer over the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been so significant that the world is now at the point where thorough testing for life-altering drugs such as experimental mRNA injections is no longer required.\n\nThe FDA adopted a “future framework” scheme that will allow Big Pharma companies to reformulate and release updated Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines without conducting any additional clinical trials. The framework permits the rollout of reformulated and completely untested vaccines in the United States.\n\nThe framework is not only limited to COVID-19 vaccines. The elimination of clinical trial requirements may also be expanded to other drugs and vaccines over time.\n\nWhile many examples of rigged vaccine trials had been recorded over the years, the future framework served as an extreme expansion and formalization of the scheme.\n\nSuch rigging involves improperly recording vaccine injuries, if not failing to record them altogether. The exclusion of parameters that turn out to be problematic, which could include injured trial participants, serves as another method.\n\nThis rigging has already occurred in Pfizer’s pediatric clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine. During the trial, the vaccine maker excluded 3,000 of 4,526 children aged between six months and four years old who were enrolled as participants – a clear red flag. (Related: JAB ‘EM YOUNG: FDA approves Pfizer’s booster vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 without consulting vaccine advisory panel.)\n\nFurthermore, the FDA’s future framework also includes the component of a COVID-19 booster dose specific to the B11529 omicron variant, which 19 of the 21 members of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted in favor of. The VRBPAC defended its decision, arguing that the modified vaccine would offer broader protection to match the circulating BA4 and BA5 omicron subvariants.\n\nMore conversations about boosters necessary moving forward\n\nDr. Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said there will be a conversation going forward to determine who will need another booster, or what the booster will look like. He did note, however, that a bivalent vaccine targeting the BA4 and BA5 subvariants seem to be the preference for the committee.\n\nDuring the VRBPAC’s meeting in April, the committee members agreed on the necessity of developing a framework for how the country can keep up with the evolving virus with an appropriate vaccine strategy. The FDA also said in May that the new normal may include an annual COVID-19 and flu shot for people, as cases are expected to rise in the fall and winter.\n\nCurrent COVID-19 vaccines are based on the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019, but Pfizer and its competitor Moderna have been working on updated versions as the current ones are not as effective against the omicron subvariants.\n\nFollowing the VRBPAC vote, the FDA will decide on the updated vaccine with a panel of independent experts that advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take a closer look at the available data and make recommendations. These recommendations would then head to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who will decide and sign off on them.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more updates about new vaccines for COVID-19 and more.\n\nWatch the video below for more information about the FDA’s future framework.\n\n\n\nThis video is from the What is happening channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nGreat Britain MP encourages workplaces and social venues to require vaccination proof from the public.\n\nBritish authorities slammed for their SLOW RESPONSE over AstraZeneca vaccine side effects.\n\nRecently released Pfizer document shows mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can cause 1,291 different adverse events.\n\nLeaked top-secret Pfizer document shows COVID-19 vaccine is FAR MORE DANGEROUS than the world knows.\n\nRoadway checkpoints for covid “vaccine” compliance rolling out in Austria… purebloods to be HUNTED by police.\n\nSources include:\n\nBlacklistedNews.com\n\nWXII12.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Now it’s the “ninja” variant of COVID they want you to be scared of: WILL IT EVER END?\n\nIt almost reads like satire, but the corporate-controlled media claims that a brand new variant of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which they are hilariously calling “ninja,” is on the move – and it is the most dangerous one yet, we are told.\n\nBA.5, as they are also calling it, is said to be a “subvariant” of the “Omicron” variant, which is an anagram for the Moronic variant. Yes, they really expect people to believe that a Moronic Ninja will kill us all if we do not mask up again and get “boosted” repeatedly.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), headed by private corporation headed up by Big Pharma plant Rochelle Walensky, insists that the Moronic Ninja subvariant serves as “a strong reminder the COVID pandemic isn’t over.”\n\nJust as a quick note: When you need to manufacture new fake scares like this to remind people that something that is clearly over is somehow not over, then you know that thing really is over.\n\nThe “ninja” variant is about selling more vaccines and boosters to keep the cash flowing to Big Pharma\n\nSo far, the only advice being dispensed by the corporate-controlled media to combat the Moronic Ninja is to keep getting vaccinated and boosted on a regular schedule.\n\nEven though the jabs have never once been shown to do anything other than make covid believers feel virtuous, they are still being dubbed the “best defense” against the never-ending covid scam, which in addition to depopulation appears to be all about the money for Big Pharma.\n\n“There are even Omicron-specific booster jabs in development that, in coming months, could make the best vaccines more effective against BA.5 and its genetic cousins,” one fake news media outlet reported, demonstrating that this is just another money grab disguised as public health.\n\n“BA.5’s widespread mutations made the subvariant less recognizable to all those antibodies we’ve built up from vaccines, boosters and past infection. BA.5 has been able to slip past our immune system, ninja-style, contributing to the rising rate of breakthrough cases and infections.”\n\nThe article goes on to state in no uncertain terms that the goal is to keep people scared and getting boosted forever. It quite literally states that the more “additional jabs” a person gets “on top of your prime course, the better protected you are.”\n\nAmazingly, they are still blaming the so-called COVID illness on a “stubborn anti-vax minority,” even though the only people getting sick are people who took the many jabs and are still getting sick from them.\n\nDr. Ben Marble, the founder of MyFreeDoctor, says that every new “variant” that emerges (assuming any of them are even real) is a product of “the C-19 fake vaccine poison.”\n\n“The people who have gotten three and four shots, they are the ones filling up the hospitals. An overwhelming majority of hospitalized people with COVID are people who took the shot,” Marble is quoted as saying.\n\n“Unvaccinated people don’t get that sick. The bottom line is the more doses of the poison shot you’ve taken, the sicker you are going to be and the more likely you’re going to die soon.”\n\nJabbing people during an outbreak, it turns out, “always create[s] mutations,” Marble further stated, calling the release of the Moronic variant “bioterrorism.”\n\nThe original so-called virus was also a bioweapon, by the way. The whole thing was contrived, just like the newest Moronic Ninja variant – and apparently, some people are still falling for it.\n\nThe latest news about the never-ending cash cow known as the COVID plandemic can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Protesters plead with parents not to get their babies injected with COVID poison shots\n\nThousands of protesters consisting of doctors, nurses, scientists and other concerned citizens pleaded with parents not to have their babies injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine bioweapon.\n\n“The jabbing of babies has begun, but not without the protests of people standing outside these injection centers begging with parents to take one more day to stop and do the research before allowing their babies to be injected,” Dr. Jane Ruby said on her program “Dr. Jane Ruby Show.”\n\nShe addressed the parents sending their babies to get injected, telling them that they were making a life-altering decision for another human being who has no ability to understand and consent to the vaccination.\n\nRuby showed a video recorded during the protests of a man talking to a family alighting their vehicle parked near the vaccination site.\n\n“Please don’t come in. Don’t do it, guys. I’m begging you not to vaccinate your kids. It’s been two years. Please just do some research. These are precious babies. They don’t have the right, they don’t have a choice,” the man said to the mother carrying her toddler. The mother dismissed the man and told him: “Leave us alone.”\n\nThe man, who was part of the protesters, insisted that the vaccination cannot be reversed once its done. He even offered to pay the family to do the research, adding: “You could come back tomorrow after you did the research.” But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as the family entered the injection site.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Ruby said the scene was just too painful to watch. “[The mother] will be the first to write to me, sue me or whatever – and stand on the street and beg for something to get this out of her baby,” she remarked.\n\nLast month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for the mRNA vaccines to be injected into babies as young as six months old. However, the regulator admitted that it still authorized the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for the youngest population even though Pfizer’s clinical trial “was determined not to be reliable due to the low number of COVID-19 cases that occurred in the study participants.”\n\nBabies will not survive the clots, Ruby warns\n\nAs seen in previous episodes of Ruby’s program, she requested parents and families not to have the children vaccinated as they could not withstand the adverse effects, especially the possibility of growing clots that were recently discovered by embalmers.\n\n“Please don’t let babies and children get this. Do whatever you can do because babies are going to start dying horrific deaths. They’re not going to be able to survive this,” Ruby pleaded.\n\nDuring the show, she once again projected on the screen the freaky white fibrous clots of different sizes that were sent to her by an experienced anonymous embalmer.\n\nThe second embalmer came out after seeing “unnatural blood clots combinations with strange fibrous materials” clogging the arteries and veins of deceased individuals approximately six months after the COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out. The second embalmer’s revelations followed initial findings by embalmer Richard Hirschman, who saw similar clots in the bodies he was handling. (Related: Mike Adams full broadcast on the Alex Jones Show, June 13th, 2022, featuring an urgent care doctor, embalmer Richard Hirschman and Dr. Jane Ruby, plus live microscopy of biostructure “clots” that are killing people.)\n\nAccording to the second embalmer, he can now identify which cadavers have these clots due to having a somewhat bloated appearance. Ruby elaborated on this discovery: “It is kind of unusual that the rest of the body is not bloated. But when the [second] embalmer sees the neck vessels, there is more puffiness and distension that is not normally seen regularly.”\n\nThe second whistleblower even disclosed to Ruby that the white, fibrous clots were from a 90-year-old person who had a lot of innervations throughout their body. “You could just imagine that the person had been through tremendous pain,” she said.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more news about the dangers of injecting the COVID-19 vaccines on babies.\n\nWatch the full segment of “Dr. Jane Ruby Show” featuring protesters begging parents to reconsider their children’s vaccination below.\n\nThis video is from the Katy Odin channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWATCH: Dr. Jane Ruby offers fresh insights about self-assembling “clots” and “nanowires” found in fully vaccinated cadavers.\n\nAnother embalmer exposes shocking post-vaccination fibrous CLOTS to Dr. Jane Ruby.\n\nGENOCIDE: FDA officially authorizes covid vaccines for children as young as 6 months.\n\nFDA uses fraudulent data to justify pushing covid shots on infants and toddlers.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nSteveKirsch.Substack.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system\n\nThe European Union (EU) has finally admitted that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines destroy the immune system and make people more susceptible not just to COVID but to all diseases.\n\nAccording to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), taking booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines every four months could weaken the immune system and tire people out. (Related: Qatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.)\n\nDespite this revelation, the EU is still recommending that people take COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. What the EMA wants to change is the time in between booster doses.\n\n“[Boosters] can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,” said Marco Cavaleri, the EMA’s head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy. “We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.”\n\nBut this revelation from the EMA has not stopped the EU from approving more vaccine doses for its population.\n\nThe EMA and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) approved the recommendation giving people between 60 and 79 years old second booster doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPeople with medical conditions that make them more susceptible to diseases are also now eligible to receive a second mRNA booster in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe approval of additional boosters for more vulnerable sectors of society was reportedly rushed following the recent rise in infections in perhaps the most vaccinated continent on the planet.\n\n“With cases and hospitalizations rising again as we enter the summer period, I urge everybody to get vaccinated and boosted as quickly as possible,” said European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides. “There is no time to lose.”\n\n“I call on member states to roll out second boosters for everyone over the age of 60 as well as all vulnerable persons immediately,” she added.\n\nECDC Director Andrea Ammon is also claiming that the continent is seeing “increasing COVID-19 case notification rates and an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries.”\n\n“This signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union,” said Ammon. “There are still too many individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible.”\n\nMore COVID-19 vaccinations will increase likelihood of death\n\n“The Daily Veracity” host Vincent James noted that even amending the time in between booster vaccinations likely won’t make any difference and people will still experience debilitating effects upon taking the vaccines.\n\n“If the vaccine and repeated doses of the vaccine destroys your immune system, which is what the European Union admitted recently, then this makes you more susceptible to all diseases,” warned James. “And if it makes you more susceptible to diseases, then it makes you more likely to die, because the vaccine destroys your immune system.”\n\nJames warned people against taking even just one COVID-19 vaccine, as evidence points to the fact that not only do they destroy the immune system, “but also they just straight up kill you.”\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Immunization.news.\n\nWatch this clip from “The Daily Veracity” as host Vincent James talks about the EU finally admitting that the COVID-19 vaccines destroy the immune system.\n\nThis video is from the Galactic Storm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nNew study confirms natural immunity provides longer, better protection against COVID-19 than vaccines.\n\nUK government data proves COVID-19 vaccines continue to damage immune system over time, creating vaccine-induced “AIDS.”\n\nSTUDY: 99% of people with previous COVID-19 infection develop natural immunity that lasts over a year.\n\nSTUDY: Natural immunity provides significantly better protection against COVID than vaccine immunity.\n\nVaccine expert: Giving COVID-19 vaccines to children is an unforgivable sin because they destroy children’s innate immune systems.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nBloomberg.com\n\nPrecisionVaccinations.com\n\nNYTimes.com\n\n\n\nFrance24.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Jacinda Ardern admits New Zealand is struggling to deal with COVID-19 pandemic despite high vaccination rate\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has admitted that the country is still struggling to deal with Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases despite its high vaccination rate.\n\nAccording to leading public health researcher Michael Baker, New Zealand is “losing the arms race with the virus.” COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed within the last week or so in an “abrupt rise.”\n\nBaker warned that the odds are against New Zealand and reports show that hospitals in the country are getting overwhelmed. Data from New Zealand also show that coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are decreasing among the unvaccinated but increasing among the vaccinated.\n\nHowever, Baker is still calling for new mRNA vaccines to be rolled out urgently while using terminology usually associated with wartime.\n\nProfessor John Gibson, an economist at Waikato University, published a paper revealing that boosters are ineffective and that the excess mortality in New Zealand highlights an alarming health deficit among people who are vaccinated.\n\nSimilar trends in other countries have been recorded among the young and working age.\n\nBut why is this kind of analysis not being taken seriously? (Related: Jacinda Ardern leads the way with disinformation.)\n\nThe great biotechnology scam\n\nFor many years pressure had been building to adopt biotechnology in agriculture and food, then in medicine and in weaponry. For people who wanted to gain the most, the potential profits were huge. After all, food and medicine are the global markets that flourish regardless of whether things are fine or not.\n\nThe release in 2019 of COVID-19, a novel biotech pathogen, was the first attack in a completely new type of global warfare. Biotech vaccines were advertised as defensive weapons that everyone needed, so the whole economic process was turned over to vaccine production and promotion.\n\nIn countries like New Zealand, political parties closed ranks behind the war effort. Government propaganda insisted that if you loved your country and your people, you would get vaccinated. If you chose not to get vaccinated, you would suffer consequences.\n\nPeople who allowed themselves to get vaccinated thus became heroes, while those who suffered vaccine injuries were ignored.\n\nInstead of being protected, the young were forced into the front lines. They were at little or no risk from coronavirus infection, but they were exposed nonetheless to a significant and measurable risk of cardiac damage through mRNA vaccination.\n\nSo why did people allow this to happen? Because of government deception and fearmongering. Also because Big Pharma published lies and false scientific data claiming that vaccine-induced immunity would “shield” society from possible infection.\n\nCensorship and propaganda amid the pandemic\n\nMeanwhile, experts who spoke up against vaccine mandates and other draconian pandemic measures were punished and censored. Politicians also fought to appear the most committed and the most generous with funding.\n\nThere are several trends within the social psychology of war, like profiteers, sadists, rumormongers and mainstream media that faithfully repeat what the government orders them to. These were all in play amid the pandemic.\n\nWhile the battle between human immunity and pathogens is an age-old conflict that humans have always won, now majority of the people have allowed their flexible immune systems to be exposed to a prescriptive mRNA vaccine designed in a lab that wasn’t sufficiently tested.\n\nProtestors have asked the government to give back their right to make their own medical choices, but the government insists on telling people what to do.\n\nWhile the first pandemic war is backed by political, financial and authoritarian ambitions, the only way to end it is for those responsible from all sides to use their common sense. Pausing biotechnology experimentation and vaccinations is the only way to ensure peace and the safety of the public.\n\nVisit Pandemic.news to learn how other countries are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about how Jacinda Ardern is spreading disinformation in New Zealand.\n\nThis video is from the Free4eva Media channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nNew Zealand lifts majority of COVID-19 restrictions amid skyrocketing cases.\n\nNew Zealand court threatens to seize property over non-payment of fine for COVID testing “non-compliance.”\n\nNZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern says vaccine side effects are PROOF the vaccine is working: Does this include heart attacks and death?\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nHatchardReport.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New York back in high risk category as “worst” omicron subvariant ravages the state\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has put all five boroughs of New York City back in the high-risk category for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as what they call the “worst” omicron subvariant spreads through the community. This is reflective of the increasingly infectious national climate as the worst version of omicron strain ravages the state.\n\nIn a tweet, the agency said: “We’re currently seeing high levels of COVID-19 in NYC. To help slow the spread, all New Yorkers should wear a high-quality mask, such as an N95, KN95 or KF94 in all public indoor settings and around crowds outside.” (Related: Del Bigtree: Rise in COVID cases from new omicron subvariants is something to watch out for.)\n\nNew York was put in the high-risk category for the latter half of May but transitioned to medium risk in June as cases slowed down. However, the boroughs are back in a heightened state of risk, and face masks are once again recommended for everyone, indoors and in public settings, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nOfficial data also revealed that the seven-day positivity rate in New York is at 14.6 percent, which is its highest since January. Some neighborhoods in Manhattan and Queens are seeing as much as 25 percent positivity rates and city health officials renewed the indoor mask advisory in light of the updated COVID data.\n\nDr. Jay Varma, a COVID-19 adviser for former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, said New Yorkers need to carry high-quality masks “if you’re in a situation where you want to reduce your risk and it’s important.\n\nHowever, he did sympathize, saying that he understands many people are tired of the mandates.\n\nReinfection rates have also supported research findings, with the overall risk across the board. Long Island is shown to have the highest reinfection rate at 7.3 per 100,000 over the last week, while New York City has 6.9 per 100,000.\n\nThe two regions represent the most virulent areas, though New York City’s rolling new case rate per 100,000 is slightly higher. The health department officials are also reevaluating their COVID alert system as they try to adapt to the changing pandemic climate.\n\nA new study also showed that the more times people get reinfected with COVID-19, the higher their chances are to incur more health issues.\n\nOther states seeing high cases of COVID as well\n\nLike prior waves, the problem is not limited to New York City only. As of Friday, June 8, more than a fifth of all the U.S. counties (667) are designated high risk for community spread – an increase of 70 percent in just the last two weeks. In New York, Westchester County joined the five boroughs as a high-risk county, but Suffolk County downgraded to medium just after a week of elevated risk.\n\nThe latest wave is due to the COVID variant BA.5, an omicron descendant that was seen to be more transmissible than previous strains. It also appears to be at least four times more vaccine-resistant, according to a Columbia University study published earlier in the week.\n\nBA.5 accounted for over 40 percent of the COVID-positive sample cases from New York State, which were sequenced for variants in the latest two-week data set.\n\nSubvariants BA.2.12.1, which caused the hospitalization surge in May, sent 87 percent of the New York State counties into the CDC’s high-risk territories for COVID despite being only 1.8 times more resistant to vaccines.\n\nVisit Pandemic.news for more updates about COVID-19.\n\nWatch the video below for a clearer picture of the New York COVID-19 situation in the past month.\n\nThis video is from the Peter R. Breggin, MD channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nYale doctor calls out CDC for committing large-scale medical fraud and hiding covid cases among the vaccinated.\n\nNewsweek op-ed written by Yale professor blasts fake news media, leftist politicians for rejecting hydroxychloroquine.\n\nHarvard professor urges parents not to give children coronavirus vaccines because “risks outweigh any benefit.”\n\nAt least half of new coronavirus infections now happening in vaccinated people as “vaccine failure” phenomenon worsens.\n\nBIG PHARMA PAYDAY: US govt. mulls purchase of COVID vaccines that claim to target omicron.\n\nSources include:\n\nNBCNewYork.com\n\nTwitter.com\n\nTimeOut.com\n\nNY1.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Article Source: National Library of Medicine | by Russell L. Blaylock\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most manipulated infectious disease events in history, characterized by official lies in an unending stream lead by government bureaucracies, medical associations, medical boards, the media, and international agencies.[3,6,57] We have witnessed a long list of unprecedented intrusions into medical practice, including attacks on medical experts, destruction of medical careers among doctors refusing to participate in killing their patients and a massive regimentation of health care, led by non-qualified individuals with enormous wealth, power and influence. For the first time in American history a president, governors, mayors, hospital administrators and federal bureaucrats are determining medical treatments based not on accurate scientifically based or even experience based information, but rather to force the acceptance of special forms of care and “prevention”—including remdesivir, use of respirators and ultimately a series of essentially untested messenger RNA vaccines. For the first time in history medical treatment, protocols are not being formulated based on the experience of the physicians treating the largest number of patients successfully, but rather individuals and bureaucracies that have never treated a single patient—including Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, EcoHealth Alliance, the CDC, WHO, state public health officers and hospital administrators.[23,38] The media (TV, newspapers, magazines, etc), medical societies, state medical boards and the owners of social media have appointed themselves to be the sole source of information concerning this so-called “pandemic”. Websites have been removed, highly credentialed and experienced clinical doctors and scientific experts in the field of infectious diseases have been demonized, careers have been destroyed and all dissenting information has been labeled “misinformation” and “dangerous lies”, even when sourced from top experts in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, pulmonary critical care, and epidemiology. These blackouts of truth occur even when this information is backed by extensive scientific citations from some of the most qualified medical specialists in the world.[23] Incredibly, even individuals, such as Dr. Michael Yeadon, a retired ex-Chief Scientist, and vice-president for the science division of Pfizer Pharmaceutical company in the UK, who charged the company with making an extremely dangerous vaccine, is ignored and demonized. Further, he, along with other highly qualified scientists have stated that no one should take this vaccine. Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most cited experts in his field, who has successfully treated over 2000 COVID patients by using a protocol of early treatment (which the so-called experts completely ignored), has been the victim of a particularly vicious assault by those benefiting financially from the vaccines. He has published his results in peer-reviewed journals, reporting an 80% reduction in hospitalizations and a 75% reduction in deaths by using early treatment.[44] Despite this, he is under an unrelenting series of attacks by the information controllers, none of which have treated a single patient. Neither Anthony Fauci, the CDC, WHO nor any medical governmental establishment has ever offered any early treatment other than Tylenol, hydration and call an ambulance once you have difficulty breathing. This is unprecedented in the entire history of medical care as early treatment of infections is critical to saving lives and preventing severe complications. Not only have these medical organizations and federal lapdogs not even suggested early treatment, they attacked anyone who attempted to initiate such treatment with all the weapons at their disposal—loss of license, removal of hospital privileges, shaming, destruction of reputations and even arrest.[2] A good example of this outrage against freedom of speech and providing informed consent information is the recent suspension by the medical board in Maine of Dr. Meryl Nass’ medical license and the ordering of her to undergo a psychiatric evaluation for prescribing Ivermectin and sharing her expertise in this field.[9,65] I know Dr, Nass personally and can vouch for her integrity, brilliance and dedication to truth. Her scientific credentials are impeccable. This behavior by a medical licensing board is reminiscent of the methodology of the Soviet KGB during the period when dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric gulags to silence their dissent.\n\nOTHER UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS Another unprecedented tactic is to remove dissenting doctors from their positions as journal editors, reviewers and retracting of their scientific papers from journals, even after these papers have been in print. Until this pandemic event, I have never seen so many journal papers being retracted— the vast majority promoting alternatives to official dogma, especially if the papers question vaccine safety. Normally a submitted paper or study is reviewed by experts in the field, called peer review. These reviews can be quite intense and nit picking in detail, insisting that all errors within the paper be corrected before publication. So, unless fraud or some other major hidden problem is discovered after the paper is in print, the paper remains in the scientific literature. We are now witnessing a growing number of excellent scientific papers, written by top experts in the field, being retracted from major medical and scientific journals weeks, months and even years after publication. A careful review indicates that in far too many instances the authors dared question accepted dogma by the controllers of scientific publications—especially concerning the safety, alternative treatments or efficacy of vaccines.[12,63] These journals rely on extensive adverting by pharmaceutical companies for their revenue. Several instances have occurred where powerful pharmaceutical companies exerted their influence on owners of these journals to remove articles that in any way question these companies’ products.[13,34,35] Worse still is the actual designing of medical articles for promoting drugs and pharmaceutical products that involve fake studies, so-called ghostwritten articles.[49,64] Richard Horton is quoted by the Guardian as saying “journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry.”[13,63] Proven fraudulent “ghostwritten” articles sponsored by pharmaceutical giants have appeared regularly in top clinical journals, such as JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine—never to be removed despite proven scientific abuse and manipulation of data.[49,63] Ghostwritten articles involve using planning companies whose job it is to design articles containing manipulated data to support a pharmaceutical product and then have these articles accepted by high-impact clinical journals, that is, the journals most likely to affect clinical decision making of doctors. Further, they supply doctors in clinical practice with free reprints of these manipulated articles. The Guardian found 250 companies engaged in this ghostwriting business. The final step in designing these articles for publication in the most prestigious journals is to recruit well recognized medical experts from prestigious institutions, to add their name to these articles. These recruited medical authors are either paid upon agreeing to add their name to these pre- written articles or they do so for the prestige of having their name on an article in a prestigious medical journal.[11] Of vital importance is the observation by experts in the field of medical publishing that nothing has been done to stop this abuse. Medical ethicists have lamented that because of this widespread practice “you can’t trust anything.” While some journals insist on disclosure information, most doctors reading these articles ignore this information or excuse it and several journals make disclosure more difficult by requiring the reader to find the disclosure statements at another location. Many journals do not police such statements and omissions by authors are common and without punishment. As concerns the information made available to the public, virtually all the media is under the control of these pharmaceutical giants or others who are benefitting from this “pandemic”. Their stories are all the same, both in content and even wording. Orchestrated coverups occur daily and massive data exposing the lies being generated by these information controllers are hidden from the public. All data coming over the national media (TV, newspaper and magazines), as well as the local news you watch every day, comes only from “official” sources—most of which are lies, distortions or completely manufactured out of whole cloth—all aimed to deceive the public. Television media receives the majority of its advertising budget from the international pharmaceutical companies—this creates an irresistible influence to report all concocted studies supporting their vaccines and other so-called treatments.[14] In 2020 alone the pharmaceutical industries spent 6.56 billion dollars on such advertising.[13,14] Pharma TV advertising amounted to 4.58 billion, an incredible 75% of their budget. That buys a lot of influence and control over the media. World famous experts within all fields of infectious diseases are excluded from media exposure and from social media should they in any way deviate against the concocted lies and distortions by the makers of these vaccines. In addition, these pharmaceutical companies spend tens of millions on social media advertising, with Pfizer leading the pack with $55 million in 2020.[14] While these attacks on free speech are terrifying enough, even worse is the virtually universal control hospital administrators have exercised over the details of medical care in hospitals. These hirelings are now instructing doctors which treatment protocols they will adhere to and which treatments they will not use, no matter how harmful the “approved” treatments are or how beneficial the “unapproved” treatments are.[33,57] Never in the history of American medicine have hospital administrators dictated to its physicians how they will practice medicine and what medications they can use. The CDC has no authority to dictate to hospitals or doctors concerning medical treatments. Yet, most physicians complied without the slightest resistance. The federal Care Act encouraged this human disaster by offering all US hospitals up to 39,000 dollars for each ICU patient they put on respirators, despite the fact that early on it was obvious that the respirators were a major cause of death among these unsuspecting, trusting patients. In addition, the hospitals received 12,000 dollars for each patient that was admitted to the ICU—explaining, in my opinion and others, why all federal medical bureaucracies (CDC, FDA, NIAID, NIH, etc) did all in their power to prevent life- saving early treatments.[46] Letting patients deteriorate to the point they needed hospitalization, meant big money for all hospitals. A growing number of hospitals are in danger of bankruptcy, and many have closed their doors, even before this “pandemic”.[50] Most of these hospitals are now owned by national or international corporations, including teaching hospitals.[10] It is also interesting to note that with the arrival of this “pandemic” we have witnessed a surge in hospital corporate chains buying up a number of these financially at-risk hospitals.[1,54] It has been noted that billions in Federal Covid aid is being used by these hospital giants to acquire these financially endangered hospitals, further increasing the power of corporate medicine over physician independence. Physicians expelled from their hospitals are finding it difficult to find other hospitals staffs to join since they too may be owned by the same corporate giant. As a result, vaccine mandate policies include far larger numbers of hospital employees. For example, Mayo Clinic fired 700 employees for exercising their right to refuse a dangerous, essentially untested experimental vaccine.[51,57] Mayo Clinic did this despite the fact that many of these employees worked during the worst of the epidemic and are being fired when the Omicron variant is the dominant strain of the virus, has the pathogenicity of a common cold for most and the vaccines are ineffective in preventing the infection. In addition, it has been proven that the vaccinated asymptomatic person has a nasopharyngeal titer of the virus as high as an infected unvaccinated person. If the purpose of the vaccine mandate is to prevent viral spread among the hospital staff and patients, then it is the vaccinated who present the greatest risk of transmission, not the unvaccinated. The difference is that a sick unvaccinated person would not go to work, the asymptomatic vaccinated spreader will. What we do know is that major medical centers, such as Mayo Clinic, receive tens of millions of dollars in NIH grants each year as well as monies from the pharmaceutical makers of these experimental “vaccines”. In my view, that is the real consideration driving these policies. If this could be proven in a court of law the administrators making these mandates should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sued by all injured parties. The hospital bankruptcy problem has grown increasingly acute due to hospitals vaccine mandates and resulting large number of hospitals staff, especially nurses, refusing to be forcibly vaccinated.[17,51] This is all unprecedented in the history of medical care. Doctors within hospitals are responsible for the treatment of their individual patients and work directly with these patients and their families to initiate these treatments. Outside organizations, such as the CDC, have no authority to intervene in these treatments and to do so exposes the patients to grave errors by an organization that has never treated a single COVID-19 patient. When this pandemic started, hospitals were ordered by the CDC to follow a treatment protocol that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of patients, most of whom would have recovered had proper treatments been allowed.[43,44] The majority of these deaths could have been prevented had doctors been allowed to use early treatment with such products as Ivermectin, hydroxy-chloroquine and a number of other safe drugs and natural compounds. It has been estimated, based on results by physicians treating the most covid patients successfully, that of the 800,000 people that we are told died from Covid, 640,000 could have not only been saved, but could have, in many cases, returned to their pre-infection health status had mandated early treatment with these proven methods been used. This neglect of early treatment constitutes mass murder. That means 160,000 would have actually died, far less than the number dying at the hands of bureaucracies, medical associations and medical boards that refused to stand up for their patients. According to studies of early treatment of thousands of patients by brave, caring doctors, seventy-five to eighty percent of the deaths could have been prevented.[43,44] Incredibly, these knowledgeable doctors were prevented from saving these Covid-19 infected people. It should be an embarrassment to the medical profession that so many doctors mindlessly followed the deadly protocols established by the controllers of medicine. One must also keep in mind that this event never satisfied the criteria for a pandemic. The World Health Organization changed the criteria to make this a pandemic. To qualify for a pandemic status the virus must have a high mortality rate for the vast majority of people, which it didn’t (with a 99.98% survival rate), and it must have no known existing treatments—which this virus had—in fact, a growing number of very successful treatments. The draconian measures established to contain this contrived “pandemic” have never been shown to be successful, such as masking the public, lockdowns, and social distancing. A number of carefully done studies during previous flu seasons demonstrated that masks, of any kind, had never prevented the spread of the virus among the public.[60] In fact, some very good studies suggested that the masks actually spread the virus by giving people a false sense of security and other factors, such as the observation that people were constantly breaking sterile technique by touching their mask, improper removal and by leakage of infectious aerosols around the edges of the mask. In addition masks were being disposed of in parking lots, walking trails, laid on tabletops in restaurants and placed in pockets and purses. Within a few minutes of putting on the mask, a number of pathogenic bacteria can be cultured from the masks, putting the immune suppressed person at a high risk of bacterial pneumonia and children at a higher risk of meningitis.[16] A study by researchers at the University of Florida cultured over 11 pathogenic bacteria from the inside of the mask worn by children in schools.[40] It was also known that children were at essentially no risk of either getting sick from the virus or transmitting it. In addition, it was also known that wearing a mask for over 4 hours (as occurs in all schools) results in significant hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high CO2 levels), which have a number of deleterious effects on health, including impairing the development of the child’s brain.[4,72,52] We have known that brain development continues long after the grade school years. A recent study found that children born during the “pandemic” have significantly lower IQs—yet school boards, school principals and other educational bureaucrats are obviously unconcerned.[18]\n\nTOOLS OF THE INDOCTRINATION TRADE The designers of this pandemic anticipated a pushback by the public and that major embarrassing questions would be asked. To prevent this, the controllers fed the media a number of tactics, one of the most commonly used was and is the “fact check” scam. With each confrontation with carefully documented evidence, the media “fact checkers” countered with the charge of “misinformation”, and an unfounded “conspiracy theory” charge that was, in their lexicon, “debunked”. Never were we told who the fact checkers were or the source of their “debunking” information—we were just to believe the “fact checkers”. A recent court case established under oath that facebook “fact checkers” used their own staff opinion and not real experts to check “facts”.[59] When sources are in fact revealed they are invariably the corrupt CDC, WHO or Anthony Fauci or just their opinion. Here is a list of things that were labeled as “myths” and “misinformation” that were later proven to be true. The asymptomatic vaccinated are spreading the virus equally as with unvaccinated symptomatic infected.\n\nThe vaccines cannot protect adequately against new variants, such as Delta and Omicron.\n\nNatural immunity is far superior to vaccine immunity and is most likely lifelong.\n\nVaccine immunity not only wanes after several months, but all immune cells are impaired for prolonged periods, putting the vaccinated at a high risk of all infections and cancer.\n\nCOVID vaccines can cause a significant incidence of blood clots and other serious side effects\n\nThe vaccine proponents will demand numerous boosters as each variant appears on the scene.\n\nFauci will insist on the covid vaccine for small children and even babies.\n\nVaccine passports will be required to enter a business, fly in a plane, and use public transportation\n\nThere will be internment camps for the unvaccinated (as in Australia, Austria and Canada)\n\nThe unvaccinated will be denied employment.\n\nThere are secret agreements between the government, elitist institutions, and vaccine makers\n\nMany hospitals were either empty or had low occupancy during the pandemic.\n\nThe spike protein from the vaccine enters the nucleus of the cell, altering cell DNA repair function.\n\nHundreds of thousands have been killed by the vaccines and many times more have been permanently damaged.\n\nEarly treatment could have saved the lives of most of the 700,000 who died.\n\nVaccine-induced myocarditis (which was denied initially) is a significant problem and clears over a short period.\n\nSpecial deadly lots (batches) of these vaccines are mixed with the mass of other Covid-19 vaccines Several of these claims by those opposing these vaccines now appear on the CDC website—most still identified as “myths”. Today, extensive evidence has confirmed that each of these so-called “myths” were in fact true. Many are even admitted by the “saint of vaccines”, Anthony Fauci. For example, we were told, even by our cognitively impaired President, that once the vaccine was released all the vaccinated people could take off their masks. Oops! We were told shortly afterward— the vaccinated have high concentrations (titers) of the virus in their noses and mouths (nasopharynx) and can transmit the virus to others in which they come into contact—especially their own family members. On go the masks once again— in fact double masking is recommended. The vaccinated are now known to be the main superspreaders of the virus and hospitals are filled with the sick vaccinated and people suffering from serious vaccine complications.[27,42,45] Another tactic by the vaccine proponents is to demonize those who reject being vaccinated for a variety of reasons. The media refers to these critically thinking individuals as “anti-vaxxers”, “vaccine deniers”, “Vaccine resisters”, “murders”, “enemies of the greater good” and as being the ones prolonging the pandemic. I have been appalled by the vicious, often heartless attacks by some of the people on social media when a parent or loved one relates a story of the terrible suffering and eventual death, they or their loved one suffered as a result of the vaccines. Some psychopaths tweet that they are glad that the loved one died or that the dead vaccinated person was an enemy of good for telling of the event and should be banned. This is hard to conceptualize. This level of cruelty is terrifying, and signifies the collapse of a moral, decent, and compassionate society. It is bad enough for the public to sink this low, but the media, political leaders, hospital administrators, medical associations and medical licensing boards are acting in a similar morally dysfunctional and cruel way.\n\nLOGIC, REASONING, AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS DISAPPEARED IN THIS EVENT Has scientific evidence, carefully done studies, clinical experience and medical logic had any effect on stopping these ineffective and dangerous vaccines? Absolutely not! The draconian efforts to vaccinate everyone on the planet continues (except the elite, postal workers, members of Congress and other insiders).[31,62] In the case of all other drugs and previous conventional vaccines under review by the FDA, the otherwise unexplained deaths of 50 or less individuals would result in a halt in further distribution of the product, as happened on 1976 with the swine flu vaccine. With over 18,000 deaths being reported by the VAERS system for the period December 14, 2020 and December 31st, 2021 as well as 139,126 serious injuries (including deaths) for the same period there is still no interest in stopping this deadly vaccine program.[61] Worse, there is no serious investigation by any government agency to determine why these people are dying and being seriously and permanently injured by these vaccines.[15,67] What we do see is a continuous series of coverups and evasions by the vaccine makers and their promoters. The war against effective cheap and very safe repurposed drugs and natural compounds, that have proven beyond all doubt to have saved millions of lives all over the world, has not only continued but has stepped up in intensity.[32,34,43] Doctors are told they cannot provide these life-saving compounds for their patients and if they do, they will be removed from the hospital, have their medical license removed or be punished in many other ways. A great many pharmacies have refused to fill prescriptions for lvermectin or hydroxy- chloroquine, despite the fact that millions of people have taken these drugs safely for over 60 years in the case of hydroxy chloroquine and decades for Ivermectin.[33,36] This refusal to fill prescriptions is unprecedented and has been engineered by those wanting to prevent alternative methods of treatment, all based on protecting vaccine expansion to all. Several companies that make hydroxy chloroquine agreed to empty their stocks of the drug by donating them to the Strategic National Stockpile, making this drug far more difficult to get.[33] Why would the government do that when over 30 well-done studies have shown that this drug reduced deaths anywhere from 66% to 92% in other countries, such as India, Egypt, Argentina, France, Nigeria, Spain, Peru, Mexico, and others?[23] The critics of these two life-saving drugs are most often funded by Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, both of which are making millions from these vaccines.[48,15] To further stop the use of these drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and Bill Gates/Anthony Fauci funded fake research to make the case that hydroxy chloroquine was a dangerous drug and could damage the heart.[34] To make this fraudulent case the researchers administered the sickest of covid patients a near lethal dose of the drug, in a dose far higher than used on any covid patient by Dr. Kory, McCullough and other “real”, and compassionate doctors, physicians who were actually treating covid patients.[23] The controlled, lap-dog media, of course, hammered the public with stories of the deadly effect of hydroxy- chloroquine, all with a terrified look of fake panic. All these stories of ivermectin dangers were shown to be untrue and some of the stories were incredibly preposterous.[37,43] The attack on Ivermectin was even more vicious than against hydroxy-chloroquine. All of this, and a great deal more is meticulously chronicled in Robert Kennedy, Jr’s excellent new book—The Real Anthony Fauci. Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health.[32] If you are truly concerned with the truth and with all that has occurred since this atrocity started, you must not only read, but study this book carefully. It is fully referenced and covers all topics in great detail. This is a designed human tragedy of Biblical proportions by some of the most vile, heartless, psychopaths in history. Millions have been deliberately killed and crippled, not only by this engineered virus, but by the vaccine itself and by the draconian measures used by these governments to “control the pandemic spread”. We must not ignore the “deaths by despair” caused by these draconian measures, which can exceed hundreds of thousands. Millions have starved in third world countries as a result. In the United States alone, of the 800,000 who died, claimed by the medical bureaucracies, well over 600,000 of these deaths were the result of the purposeful neglect of early treatment, blocking the use of highly effective and safe repurposed drugs, such as hydroxy-chloroquine and Ivermectin, and the forced use of deadly treatments such as remdesivir and use of ventilators. This does not count the deaths of despair and neglected medical care caused by the lockdown and hospital measures forced on healthcare systems. To compound all this, because of vaccine mandates among all hospital personnel, thousands of nurses and other hospital workers have resigned or been fired.[17,30,51] This has resulted in critical shortages of these vital healthcare workers and dangerous reductions of ICU beds in many hospitals. In addition, as occurred in the Lewis County Healthcare System, a specialty-hospital system in Lowville, N.Y., closed its maternity unit following the resignation of 30 hospital staff over the state’s disastrous vaccine mandate orders. The irony in all these cases of resignations is that the administrators unhesitatingly accepted these mass staffing losses despite rantings about suffering from short staffing during a “crisis”. This is especially puzzling when we learned that the vaccines did not prevent viral transmission and the present predominant variant is of extremely low pathogenicity.\n\nDANGERS OF THE VACCINES ARE INCREASINGLY REVEALED BY SCIENCE While most researchers, virologists, infectious disease researchers and epidemiologists have been intimidated into silence, a growing number of high integrity individuals with tremendous expertise have come forward to tell the truth—that is, that these vaccines are deadly. Most new vaccines must go through extensive safety testing for years before they are approved. New technologies, such as the mRNA and DNA vaccines, require a minimum of 10 years of careful testing and extensive follow-up. These new so-called vaccines were “tested” for only 2 months and then the results of these safety test were and continue to be kept secret. Testimony before Senator Ron Johnson by several who participated in the 2 months study indicates that virtually no follow-up of the participants of the pre-release study was ever done.[67] Complains of complications were ignored and despite promises by Pfizer that all medical expenses caused by the “vaccines” would be paid by Pfizer, these individuals stated that none were paid.[66] Some medical expenses exceed 100,000 dollars. As an example of the deception by Pfizer, and the other makers of mRNA vaccines, is the case of 12-year-old Maddie de Garay, who participated in the Pfizer vaccine pre-release safety study. At Sen. Johnson’s presentation with the families of the vaccine injured, her mother told of her child’s recurrent seizures, that she is now confined to a wheelchair, must be tube fed and suffers permanent brain damage. On the Pfizer safety evaluation submitted to the FDA her only side effect is listed as having a “stomachache”. Each person submitted similar horrifying stories. The Japanese resorted to a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) lawsuit to force Pfizer to release its secret biodistribution study. The reason Pfizer wanted it kept secret is that it demonstrated that Pfizer lied to the public and the regulatory agencies about the fate of the injected vaccine contents (the mRNA enclosed nano-lipid carrier). They claimed that it remained at the site of the injection (the shoulder), when in fact their own study found that it rapidly spread throughout the entire body by the bloodstream within 48 hours. The study also found that these deadly nano-lipid carriers collected in very high concentrations in several organs, including the reproductive organs of males and females, the heart, the liver, the bone marrow, and the spleen (a major immune organ). The highest concentration was in the ovaries and the bone marrow. These nano-lipid carriers also were deposited in the brain. Dr. Ryan Cole, a pathologist from Idaho reported a dramatic spike in highly aggressive cancers among vaccinated individuals, (not reported in the Media). He found a frighteningly high incidence of highly aggressive cancers in vaccinated individuals, especially highly invasive melanomas in young people and uterine cancers in women.[26] Other reports of activation of previously controlled cancers are also appearing among vaccinated cancer patients.[47] Thus far, no studies have been done to confirm these reports, but it is unlikely such studies will be done, at least studies funded by grants from the NIH. The high concentration of spike proteins found in the ovaries in the biodistribution study could very well impair fertility in young women, alter menstruation, and could put them at an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The high concentration in the bone marrow, could also put the vaccinated at a high risk of leukemia and lymphoma. The leukemia risk is very worrisome now that they have started vaccinating children as young as 5 years of age. No long-term studies have been conducted by any of these makers of Covid-19 vaccines, especially as regards the risk of cancer induction. Chronic inflammation is intimately linked to cancer induction, growth and invasion and vaccines stimulate inflammation. Cancer patients are being told they should get vaccinated with these deadly vaccines. This, in my opinion, is insane. Newer studies have shown that this type of vaccine inserts the spike protein within the nucleus of the immune cells (and most likely many cell types) and once there, inhibits two very important DNA repair enzymes, BRCA1 and 53BP1, whose duty it is to repair damage to the cell’s DNA.[29] Unrepaired DNA damage plays a major role in cancer. There is a hereditary disease called xeroderma pigmentosum in which the DNA repair enzymes are defective. These ill-fated individuals develop multiple skin cancers and a very high incidence of organ cancer as a result. Here we have a vaccine that does the same thing, but to a less extensive degree. One of the defective repair enzymes caused by these vaccines is called BRCA1, which is associated with a significantly higher incidence of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. It should be noted that no studies were ever done on several critical aspects of this type of vaccine. They have never been tested for long term effects\n\nThey have never been tested for induction of autoimmunity\n\nThey have never been properly tested for safety during any stage of pregnancy\n\nNo follow-up studies have been done on the babies of vaccinated women\n\nThere are no long-term studies on the children of vaccinated pregnant women after their birth (Especially as neurodevelopmental milestone occur).\n\nIt has never been tested for effects on a long list of medical conditions: Diabetes Heart disease Atherosclerosis Neurodegenerative diseases Neuropsychiatric effects Induction of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia Long term immune function Vertical transmission of defects and disorders Cancer Autoimmune disorders\n\nPrevious experience with the flu vaccines clearly demonstrates that the safety studies done by researchers and clinical doctors with ties to pharmaceutical companies were essentially all either poorly done or purposefully designed to falsely show safety and coverup side effects and complications. This was dramatically demonstrated with the previously mentioned phony studies designed to indicate that hydroxy Chloroquine and Ivermectin were ineffective and too dangerous to use.[34,36,37] These fake studies resulted in millions of deaths and severe health disasters worldwide. As stated, 80% of all deaths were unnecessary and could have been prevented with inexpensive, safe repurposed medications with a very long safety history among millions who have taken them for decades or even a lifetime.[43,44] It is beyond ironic that those claiming that they are responsible for protecting our health approved a poorly tested set of vaccines that has resulted in more deaths in less than a year of use than all the other vaccines combined given over the past 30 years. Their excuse when confronted was—“we had to overlook some safety measures because this was a deadly pandemic”.[28,46] In 1986 President Reagan signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which gave blanket protection to pharmaceutical makers of vaccines against injury litigation by families of vaccine injured individuals. The Supreme Court, in a 57-page opinion, ruled in favor of the vaccine companies, effectively allowing vaccine makers to manufacture and distribute dangerous, often ineffective vaccines to the population without fear of legal consequences. The court did insist on a vaccine injury compensation system which has paid out only a very small number of rewards to a large number of severely injured individuals. It is known that it is very difficult to receive these awards. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, since 1988 the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has agreed to pay 3,597 awards among 19,098 vaccine injured individuals applying amounting to a total sum of $3.8 billion. This was prior to the introduction of the Covid-19 vaccines, in which the deaths alone exceed all deaths related to all the vaccines combined over a thirty-year period. In 2018 President Trump signed into law the “right-to-try” law which allowed the use of experimental drugs and all unconventional treatments to be used in cases of extreme medical conditions. As we have seen with the refusal of many hospitals and even blanket refusal by states to allow Ivermectin, hydroxy-chloroquine or any other unapproved “official” methods to treat even terminal Covid-19 cases, these nefarious individuals have ignored this law. Strangely, they did not use this same logic or the law when it came to Ivermectin and Hydroxy Chloroquine, both of which had undergone extensive safety testing by over 30 clinical studies of a high quality and given glowing reports on both efficacy and safety in numerous countries. In addition, we had a record of use for up to 60 years by millions of people, using these drugs worldwide, with an excellent safety record. It was obvious that a group of very powerful people in conjunction with pharmaceutical conglomerates didn’t want the pandemic to end and wanted vaccines as the only treatment option. Kennedy’s book makes this case using extensive evidence and citations.[14,32] Dr. James Thorpe, an expert in maternal-fetal medicine, demonstrates that these covoid-19 vaccines given during pregnancy have resulted in a 50-fold higher incidence of miscarriage than reported with all other vaccines combined.[28] When we examine his graph on fetal malformations there was a 144-fold higher incidence of fetal malformation with the Covid-19 vaccines given during pregnancy as compared to all other vaccines combined. Yet, the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology endorse the safety of these vaccines for all stages of pregnancy and among women breast feeding their babies. It is noteworthy that these medical specialty groups have received significant funding from Pfizer pharmaceutical company. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, just in the 4th quarter of 2010, received a total of $11,000 from Pfizer Pharmaceutical company alone.[70] Funding from NIH grants are much higher.[20] The best way to lose these grants is to criticize the source of the funds, their products or pet programs. Peter Duesberg, because of his daring to question Fauci’s pet theory of AIDS caused by HIV virus, was no longer awarded any of the 30 grant applications he submitted after going public. Prior to this episode, as the leading authority on retroviruses in the world, he had never been turned down for an NIH grant.[39] This is how the “corrupted” system works, even though much of the grant money comes from our taxes.\n\nHOT LOTS—DEADLY BATCHES OF THE VACCINES A new study has now surfaced, the results of which are terrifying.[25] A researcher at Kingston University in London, has completed an extensive analysis of the VAERs data (a subdepartment of the CDC which collects voluntary vaccine complication data), in which he grouped reported deaths following the vaccines according to the manufacturer’s lot numbers of the vaccines. Vaccines are manufactured in large batches called lots. What he discovered was that the vaccines are divided into over 20,000 lots and that one out of every 200 of these batches (lots) is demonstrably deadly to anyone who receives a vaccine from that lot, which includes thousands of vaccine doses. He examined all manufactured vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen), etc. He found that among every 200 batches of the vaccine from Pfizer and other makers, one batch of the 200 was found to be over 50x more deadly than vaccines batches from other lots. The other vaccine lots (batches) were also causing deaths and disabilities, but nowhere near to this extent. These deadly batches should have appeared randomly among all “vaccines” if it was an unintentional event. However, he found that 5% of the vaccines were responsible for 90% of the serious adverse events, including deaths. The incidence of deaths and serious complications among these “hot lots” varied from over 1000% to several thousand percent higher than comparable safer lots. If you think this was by accident—think again. This is not the first time “hot lots” were, in my opinion, purposefully manufactured and sent across the nation—usually vaccines designed for children. In one such scandal, “hot lots” of a vaccine ended up all in one state and the damage immediately became evident. What was the manufacture’s response? It wasn’t to remove the deadly batches of the vaccine. He ordered his company to scatter the hot lots across the nation so that authorities would not see the obvious deadly effect. All lots of a vaccine are numbered—for example Modera labels them with such codes as 013M20A. It was noted that the batch numbers ended in either 20A or 21A. Batches ending in 20A were much more toxic than the ones ending in 21A. The batches ending in 20A had about 1700 adverse events, versus a few hundred to twenty or thirty events for the 21A batches. This example explains why some people had few or no adverse events after taking the vaccine while others are either killed or severely and permanently harmed. To see the researcher’s explanation, go to https://www.bitchute.com/video/6xIYPZBkydsu/ In my opinion these examples strongly suggest an intentional alteration of the production of the “vaccine” to include deadly batches. I have met and worked with a number of people concerned with vaccine safety and I can tell you they are not the evil anti-vaxxers you are told they are. They are highly principled, moral, compassionate people, many of which are top researchers and people who have studied the issue extensively. Robert Kennedy, Jr, Barbara Lou Fisher, Dr. Meryl Nass, Professor Christopher Shaw, Megan Redshaw, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Neil Z. Miller, Dr. Lucija Tomjinovic, Dr. Stephanie Seneff, Dr. Steve Kirsch and Dr. Peter McCullough just to name a few. These people have nothing to gain and a lot to lose. They are attacked viciously by the media, government agencies, and elite billionaires who think they should control the world and everyone in it.\n\nWHY DID FAUCI WANT NO AUTOPSIES OF THOSE WHO DIED AFTER VACCINATION? There are many things about this “pandemic” that are unprecedented in medical history. One of the most startling is that at the height of the pandemic so few autopsies, especially total autopsies, were being done. A mysterious virus was rapidly spreading around the world, a selected group of people with weakened immune systems were getting seriously ill and many were dying and the one way we could rapidly gain the most knowledge about this virus—an autopsy, was being discouraged. Guerriero noted that by the end of April, 2020 approximately 150,000 people had died, yet there were only 16 autopsies performed and reported in the medical literature.[24] Among these, only seven were complete autopsies, the remaining 9 being partial or by needle biopsy or incisional biopsy. Only after 170,000 deaths by Covid-19 and four months into the pandemic were the first series of autopsies actually done, that is, more than ten. And only after 280,000 deaths and another month, were the first large series of autopsies performed, some 80 in number.[22] Sperhake, in a call for autopsies to be done without question, noted that the first full autopsy reported in the literature along with photomicrographs appeared in a medico-legal journal from China in February 2020.[41,68] Sperhake expressed confusion as to why there was a reluctance to perform autopsies during the crisis, but he knew it was not coming from the pathologists. The medical literature was littered with appeals by pathologist for more autopsies to be performed.[58] Sperhake further noted that the Robert Koch Institute (The German health monitoring system) at least initially advised against doing autopsies. He also knew that at the time 200 participating autopsy institutions in the United States had done at least 225 autopsies among 14 states. Some have claimed that this dearth of autopsies was based on the government’s fear of infection among the pathologists, but a study of 225 autopsies on Covid-19 cases demonstrated only one case of infection among the pathologist and this was concluded to have been an infection contracted elsewhere.[19] Guerriero ends his article calling for more autopsies with this observation: “Shoulder to shoulder, clinical and forensic pathologists overcame the obstructions of autopsy studies in Covid-19 victims and hereby generated valuable knowledge on the pathophysiology of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 and the human body, thus contributing to our understanding of the disease.”[24] Suspicion concerning the worldwide reluctance of nations to allow full post mortem studies of Covid-19 victims may be based on the idea that it was more than by chance. There are at least two possibilities that stand out. First, those leading the progression of this “non-pandemic” event into a perceived worldwide “deadly pandemic”, were hiding an important secret that autopsies could document. Namely, just how many of the deaths were actually caused by the virus? To implement draconian measures, such as mandated mask wearing, lockdowns, destruction of businesses, and eventually mandated forced vaccination, they needed very large numbers of covid-19 infected dead. Fear would be the driving force for all these destructive pandemic control programs. Elder et al in his study classified the autopsy findings into four groups.[22] Certain Covid-19 death Probably Covid-19 death Possible Covid-19 death Not associated with Covid-19, despite the positive test. What possibly concerned or even terrified the engineers of this pandemic was that autopsies just might, and did, show that a number of these so-called Covid-19 deaths in truth died of their comorbid diseases. In the vast majority of autopsy studies reported, pathologists noted multiple comorbid conditions, most of which at the extremes of life could alone be fatal. Previously it was known that common cold viruses had an 8% mortality in nursing homes. In addition, valuable evidence could be obtained from the autopsies that would improve clinical treatments and could possibly demonstrate the deadly effect of the CDC mandated protocols all hospitals were required to follow, such as the use of respirators and the deadly, kidney-destroying drug remdesivir. The autopsies also demonstrated accumulating medical errors and poor-quality care, as the shielding of doctors in intensive care units from the eyes of family members inevitably leads to poorer quality care as reported by several nurses working in these areas.[53–55] As bad as all this was, the very same thing is being done in the case of Covid vaccine deaths—very few complete autopsies have been done to understand why these people died, that is, until recently. Two highly qualified researchers, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi a microbiologist and highly qualified expert in infectious disease and Dr. Arne Burkhardt, a pathologist who is a widely published authority having been a professor of pathology at several prestigious institutions, recently performed autopsies on 15 people having died after vaccination. What they found explains why so many are dying and experiencing organ damage and deadly blood clots.[5] They determined that 14 of the fifteen people died as a result of the vaccines and not of other causes. Dr. Burkhardt, the pathologist, observed widespread evidence of an immune attack on the autopsied individuals’ organs and tissues— especially their heart. This evidence included extensive invasion of small blood vessels with massive numbers of lymphocytes, which cause extensive cell destruction when unleashed. Other organs, such as the lungs and liver, were observed to have extensive damage as well. These findings indicate the vaccines were causing the body to attack itself with deadly consequences. One can easily see why Anthony Fauci, as well as public health officers and all who are heavily promoting these vaccines, publicly discouraged autopsies on the vaccinated who subsequently died. One can also see that in the case of vaccines, that were essentially untested prior to being approved for the general public, at least the regulatory agencies should have been required to carefully monitor and analyze all serious complications, and certainly deaths, linked to these vaccines. The best way to do that is with complete autopsies. While we learned important information from these autopsies what is really needed are special studies of the tissues of those who have died after vaccination for the presence of spike protein infiltration throughout the organs and tissues. This would be critical information, as such infiltration would result in severe damage to all tissues and organs involved—especially the heart, the brain, and the immune system. Animal studies have demonstrated this. In these vaccinated individuals the source of these spike proteins would be the injected nanolipid carriers of the spike protein producing mRNA. It is obvious that the government health authorities and pharmaceutical manufacturers of these “vaccines” do not want these critical studies done as the public would be outraged and demand an end to the vaccination program and prosecution of the involved individuals who covered this up."

        "As Boris Johnson resigned, UK officials quietly released data showing that covid death rate is highest among fully vaccinated\n\nJust hours before now-former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned from his post on July 7, the British government quietly and strategically dropped a major bombshell confirming that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” are not saving lives.\n\nSince at least April of this year, the “fully vaccinated” population of England accounts for the vast majority of deaths that are being blamed on “covid” – this in terms of deaths per 100,000 people, which is how the data is presented.\n\nWhile the unvaccinated are mostly doing just fine, going about their lives with normal health, those who took all the jabs in obedience to Johnson’s regime are dropping like flies, probably due to vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).\n\nAs you may recall, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced back in March that starting on April Fool’s Day, it would no longer be publishing the vaccination status of covid cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. Now we know why they did this. (Related: the UKHSA also deleted a study from its official reporting that linked covid injections to increased risk of infection.)\n\n“At the time, the UKHSA claimed this was because the UK Government had ended free universal Covid-19 testing and this, therefore, affected their ‘ability to robustly monitor Covid-19 cases by vaccination status,'” reports Exposé News.\n\n“However, this was a lie.”\n\nFauci Flu shots increase a person’s risk of death from “covid,” data shows\n\nAs the UKHSA was fudging the numbers and changing its reporting standards, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), another British government agency, published a report of its own outlining deaths by vaccination status in England. That report showed that England’s vaccinated population accounted for a whopping 94 percent of deaths between April 1 and May 31.\n\nOnce again, it becomes abundantly clear why the UKHSA changed its reporting requirements starting on April 1: because the data shows, without a shadow of a doubt, that covid injections are killing people, not protecting them.\n\n“… now we can also reveal that this is not because the majority of people have been vaccinated, which in turn statistically results in more deaths,” Exposé News further reported.\n\n“It is instead, as the ONS data shows, because the Covid-19 injections are increasing recipients’ risk of death if infected with Covid-19.”\n\nUsing Pfizer’s own vaccine efficacy formula, it can be further shown from official UK data that getting injected for covid has a negative effectiveness against death, meaning a person is more likely to die if he or she gets jabbed as opposed to just leaving natural immunity intact.\n\nThe Pfizer documents, which a court order forced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to release against the agency’s will, further show that the mRNA (messenger RNA) injections from both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna induce ADE, which causes natural immunity to wane over time, much like AIDS.\n\nBecause of this, many now refer to the immune degradation that occurs post-injection for covid as VAIDS, or vaccine-induced AIDS, as it bears many of the same hallmarks as traditional AIDS – though mechanistically the action of immune destruction is different.\n\n“ADE can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the ‘Trojan Horse Pathway,'” Exposé News further explains. “This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies generated by past infection or vaccination fail to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure.”\n\n“Instead, they act as a gateway by allowing the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off-limits (typically immune cells, like macrophages). That, in turn, can lead to wider dissemination of illness, and over-reactive immune responses that cause more severe illness.”\n\nFauci Flu shots are a death sentence for many.

        "Federal judge bars Air Force, Space Force from discharging members who turn down the COVID clot shot on religious grounds\n\nA federal magistrate ruled that the Air Force and Space Force, including the Air Force Reserve, cannot discharge or penalize service members who request religious exemptions to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination.\n\nU.S. District Judge Matthew McFarland said in a July 14 decision that “no punishment, discipline or adverse action may be taken against service members who submitted a religious accommodation request for exemption from the vaccine mandate.” His 14-day injunction applied to the Air Force and the Space Force, which was established in December 2019 by former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe magistrate of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio gave the government seven days to respond and explain why the court “should not grant a class-wide preliminary injunction,” reported Just The News.\n\nMcFarland noted in his decision that the Air Force violated the constitutional freedom of affected service members by its “clear policy of discrimination against religious accommodation requests.”\n\nAir Force Reserve Lieutenant Colonel R. Davis Younts, legal counsel for the service members who lodged religious exemption requests, lauded the federal judge’s decision.\n\n“My clients and I are grateful for the attorneys working on this case and the efforts they have made for religious freedom in the military. While the current temporary restraining order is set to last for 14 days we anticipate that it will be extended.”\n\nYounts said that several airmen he represented already have their administrative hearing scheduled. He added that if the injunction stands, the Air Force cannot proceed with their termination as litigation of the military branch’s alleged violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the constitutional rights of military members is still ongoing.\n\nAir Force Master Sergeant Nick Kupper, who had served in the military for 19 years, was among those facing expulsion for rejecting the vaccine. However, he cited data from the Department of Defense that showed a three-fold increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths every month since the mandate was put in place.\n\n“I’m just one of hundreds of thousands of [service members] who are being kicked out because we won’t take an illegal, emergency-use vaccine,” Kupper told Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nJuly 14 injunction followed earlier victory\n\nMcFarland’s July 14 ruling was not the first time a magistrate ruled in favor of military service members fighting for their health freedom. Back in February, an unnamed airwoman was permitted to remain unvaccinated on religious grounds.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tilman E. Self III granted a preliminary injunction for the female Air Force Reserve officer on Feb. 15. The magistrate of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia ruled that the Air Force had infringed on her First Amendment rights when internal military reviewers rejected her initial request for exemption. (Related: VICTORY: Female Air Force officer becomes first to win injunction against covid jab mandate.)\n\nThe airwoman completed a religion-based exemption form in 2021, in which she cited her Christian faith and opposition to abortion as reasons for declining the vaccine. She later appealed the initial rejection in December of the same year.\n\nSelf, who served as an Army field artillery officer for four years, described the Air Force’s persistent rejections of COVID-19 vaccine exemptions on religious grounds as “illusory and insincere.”\n\n“It seems illogical to think, let alone argue, that plaintiff’s religious-based refusal to take a [COVID-19] vaccine would ‘seriously impede’ military function – when the Air Force has at least 3,300 other service members still on duty who are just as unvaccinated,” the magistrate’s ruling stated.\n\n“The only difference is that plaintiff is unvaccinated because she followed her religion, and the others were granted either a medical or administrative exemption from receiving a vaccine.”\n\nVisit HealthFreedom.news to read more stories about military members pushing back against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nWatch the video below as Gabor “Gabe” Zolna talks about the fate of three Air Force cadets who refused the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the zolnareport.com channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nAirman fighting possible DISMISSAL for refusing to get the COVID clot shot.\n\nAir Force to WASTE millions in taxpayer money by discharging trained, experienced, pilots over COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAir Force rejects requests from soldiers seeking medical exemption from covid vaccine mandates (are they trying to kill off the military?)\n\nSources include:\n\nWND.com\n\nJustTheNews.com\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New COVID-19 vaccines will be designed for “immune imprinting,” leading to more vaccinated people getting sick and dying\n\nThe next batch of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines developed by Big Pharma companies will be perfectly designed to drive “immune imprinting,” leading to more sicknesses and deaths of people who take new and experimental vaccines.\n\nThis was according to Dr. Robert Malone, who discussed immune imprinting during an appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room.” This followed President Joe Biden’s approval of a new $3.2 billion deal with Big Pharma company Pfizer for new COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThese new vaccines are “retooled” supposedly to better deal with the post-vaccine omicron variant. But Malone argued the new vaccines will be “perfectly designed to drive immune imprinting and make people even more susceptible to infection.”\n\nImmune imprinting is a phenomenon that occurs when a person is exposed to the proteins or other biological structures of viruses that allow them to penetrate host cells and cause infections, like those found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease.\n\nTheoretically, when an immune system has been successfully imprinted, the body will then have the ability to recall existing memory cells – immune system cells that “remember” the same pathogen – and provide the body with faster future antibody production when confronted with the disease. (Related: European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system.)\n\nImmune imprinting leaves people vulnerable to other illnesses\n\n“Immune imprinting is basically why a lot of people are susceptible to dying of other things,” commented Ben Armstrong during an episode of his program, “The Ben Armstrong Show.”\n\n“It’s pushing your immune system to basically concentrate on one thing, which would be whatever they’re jabbing you with,” said Armstrong. “The new jab, if it’s perfectly designed, sounds like it would make you focus even more so just on that [disease], leaving you even more open to other illnesses.”\n\nArmstrong also warns that immune imprinting vaccines are unlikely to protect people against different variants of the same disease the vaccine is supposedly meant to defend people against.\n\nSteve Brozak and Richard Marfuggi, writing for STAT News about immune imprinting, noted that current studies suggest that imprinting is just as likely to result in reduced responses to variants of the same disease as it is to provide the body with enhanced responses, and the clinical consequences of immune imprinting are still unknown.\n\nFurthermore, they warn of the potential dangers of imprinting immature immune systems, such as those of infants and toddlers.\n\n“The immune systems of infants and toddlers – the targets of the latest COVID-19 vaccination approval – are immature and developing,” they wrote.\n\n“If an immature immune system is immunologically imprinted, either by acute infection from the currently circulating viral variant or by a COVID-19 vaccine based on the original, wild-type variant that is no longer in circulation, it may fail to develop appropriate defenses when confronted – even years later – by a COVID variant or another totally different pathogen.”\n\nLearn more about the experimental and dangerous vaccines at DangerousMedicine.com.\n\nWatch this episode of “The Ben Armstrong Show” as host Ben Armstrong talks about immune imprinting.\n\nThis video is from the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nQatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.\n\nThe more vaccines you take, the weaker your immune system becomes.\n\nUK government data proves COVID-19 vaccines continue to damage immune systems over time, creating vaccine-induced “AIDS.”\n\nPfizer admits in confidential document that COVID-19 vaccine causes Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (same thing as Antibody Dependent Enhancement).\n\nVaccine expert: Giving COVID-19 vaccines to children is an unforgivable sin because they destroy children’s innate immune systems.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nStatNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "STUDY: Natural immunity to covid never wanes, but fully jabbed are developing AIDS\n\nEvery person who left his immune system alone now has permanent immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), a new study has found. But every person who got “vaccinated” now has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, also known as AIDS.\n\nResearchers in Qatar looked at data from the Qatari National digital-health information platform, which covers the country’s entire population. Nearly 90 percent of the country is expatriates from over 150 countries, so the data is expansive.\n\nThey determined from this data that everyone in the country who tested “positive” for covid and later recovered still has the same amount of immunity to the disease. Not even one percent of their natural immunity waned.\n\nConversely, everyone in the country who took the jabs like Tony Fauci and Rochelle Walensky told them to is now in a developing state of immune degradation. Over time, the “fully vaccinated,” as they call them, are losing their ability to fight off any kind of disease, including covid.\n\nThe paper in its entirety is available for viewing and analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n“So natural immunity provides non waning 97.3% long term protection against severe, critical or fatal infection for at least 14 months and by extrapolation – indefinitely,” reported Exposé News, which analyzed the findings.\n\n“Whereas mRNA vaccine immunity wanes to 55.6% at some time after 7 months. Perhaps around 12 months?”\n\nThere’s a reason why nobody in the industry wants to talk about vaccine effectiveness after six months\n\nThe new findings corroborate with earlier ones concerning the development of vaccine-induced AIDS, or VAIDS, in people who take the jabs.\n\nIt appears that the more people get injected for the Chinese Virus, the worse off their immune systems become at fighting it off. Meanwhile, those who skipped the jabs are generally in good health with normal, fully functioning immunity.\n\nThe Exposé, which focuses primarily on data out of the United Kingdom, has been saying for a while now that the fully jabbed are more prone to getting sick and dying while the unvaccinated have long since moved on from all the covid hysteria. This new Qatari paper only further supports that narrative.\n\nMost of the scrutiny for the jabs, which is slim to begin with, only looks at their immediate impact. If a person seems fine in the days or weeks following injection, then they are declared to be a success – but what about the effects after, say, six months?\n\nNobody seems to want to talk about that because the data almost universally shows that vaccine effectiveness quickly turns negative. This means that over time, immune function wanes to the point that “boosters” are needed in order for a person to continue living.\n\nEarly warnings about VAIDS were shrugged off as a wild conspiracy theory, but now it is becoming clear that fully jabbed people have to continue getting jabbed if they want to live – otherwise there is a good chance that they will die upon exposure to anything, including the common cold.\n\nThe timeline for immune degradation will vary from person to person, but once it runs its course it seems to be game over for those who believed Fauci and Walensky and obeyed their commands.\n\n“We predicted in October of 2021 that vaccinated people would have VAIDS by the end of the year,” the Exposé says. “We deduced that from the 5% increase in initial infection rates in the doubly vaccinated every week compared to the unvaccinated.”\n\n“The results of this type of VAIDS have been these ridiculous surges in Covid19 infections right in the middle of summer when people do not normally get the flu. What the Qatari data shows, and what any trained virologist or immunologist is taught ab initio, is that acquired immunity does not wane (other than through HIV or some immune disorder).”\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nNEJM.org\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "European Medicines Agency adds SEVERE allergic reaction to Novavax COVID shot’s side effects\n\nThe European Union’s regulator for medicines added severe allergic reaction to the list of side effects caused by the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine from Novavax.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a July 14 update: “The product information of [the] Nuvaxovid [vaccine] will be updated with severe allergic reaction and unusual or decreased feeling in the skin as new side effects.” It added that following the assessment of the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, “anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) will be included in the EU product information as a side effect of Nuvaxovid.”\n\nAccording to the EMA, “a few cases” of anaphylaxis linked to the Novavax shot were reported – but the regulator refused to disclose the actual figure.\n\n“Generally, cases reported spontaneously by a patient or healthcare professional concern suspected side effects – i.e. medical events that have been observed after vaccination – but which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine.”\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted the Maryland-based vaccine maker for comment, but did not receive a response as of writing.\n\nAccording to The COVID Blog, the Novavax sub-unit protein vaccine delivers the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an insect virus. It also utilizes saponin from the soap bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) native to South America to trigger an immune response in the body.\n\nFDA grants EUA for the Novavax vaccine despite cardiac inflammation warning\n\nMeanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine on July 13.\n\n“Authorizing an additional vaccine expands the available vaccine options for the prevention of COVID-19, including the most severe outcomes that can occur such as hospitalization and death,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. He added that the EUA gives people another vaccine choice that meets the agency’s “rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.”\n\nThe July 13 EUA issued by the regulator permitted the use of the two-dose vaccine, with an interval of several weeks, on adults aged 18 and up. In petitioning the FDA for an EUA, Novavax said it would market its vaccine to individuals who did not want to get the COVID-19 vaccines already authorized in the United States. Currently, the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and the single-dose adenoviral vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson are authorized for use.\n\nThe vaccine’s product label in the U.S. warned against injecting it to people with a history of allergic reactions to any of its components. But even before it was granted EUA, staffers at the FDA pointed out that the vaccine increased the risk of myocarditis. (Related: FDA warns of CARDIAC INFLAMMATION risk linked to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.)\n\nIn documents released June 3, staff members at the regulator cited four events of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – that occurred during clinical trials of the vaccine. Novavax conducted trials of its sub-unit protein vaccine on almost 30,000 patients between December 2020 and September 2021.\n\n“These events raise the concern for a causal association with this vaccine, similar to the association documents with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,” they noted.\n\n“Data from passive surveillance during post-authorization use in other countries also indicate a higher than expected rate of myocarditis and pericarditis [heart lining inflammation] … associated with the vaccine. Further evaluation is needed to inform the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, and their outcomes, as additional data emerge over time.”\n\nWatch the video below as Dr. Jane Ruby warns against the dangers of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the Truth or Consequences channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nIMPOSSIBLE SCIENCE: Novavax says it will have a new “vaccine” ready in just two weeks for the “Omicron” variant, which appeared just last week.\n\nOperation Warp Speed gives $1.6 billion in taxpayer funding to Novavax for coronavirus vaccines.\n\n3 Aussie women experience SERIOUS REACTIONS after getting Novavax COVID shot.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nEMA.Europa.eu [PDF]\n\nTheCOVIDBlog.com\n\nFDA.gov 1\n\nFDA.gov 2\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "WHO head Tedros urges people to MASK UP again, even though face masks don’t work\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), urged people to wear face masks once more amid a purported rise in Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.\n\nHe defended the necessity of face coverings against COVID-19 in public remarks delivered July 12, during the WHO’s COVID-19 media briefing that day. “As transmission and hospitalization [rates] rise, governments must also deploy tried and tested measures like masking, improved ventilation and test-and-treat protocols,” said Tedros, adding that “diagnostics, treatments and vaccines are not being deployed effectively.”\n\n“There is a major disconnect in COVID-19 risk perception between scientific communities, political leaders and the general public,” according to the WHO head. Thus, he acknowledged “the dual challenge of communicating risk and building community trust in health tools and public health social measures like masking, distancing and ventilation.”\n\nTedros’ call for re-imposing mask mandates stemmed from his apparent concern about the continued rise of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These, he mentioned, put “further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers.”\n\nEpidemiologist and former Trump administration advisor Dr. Paul Alexander blasted Tedros in a Substack post. He wrote: “Does [Tedros] not know the clear evidence that the masks never worked and will never work for this respiratory virus?\n\n“Masks are so very ineffective … and [are] actually harmful, especially to our children. We are damaging our children and will continue to damage their developing innate immune systems with these insane, specious, illogical, irrational, absurd, non-sensical corrupted unsound COVID-19 policies.”\n\nAlexander added that “nothing worked” of the many COVID-19 measures put in place by governments worldwide.\n\n“Not one lockdown, school closure, mask mandate, business closure, nothing. They all failed. All of our governments failed – and all they did was [make] money, [steal] emergency powers and [harm] us.”\n\nIronically, Tedros was photographed during the G7 Summit weeks prior – devoid of a face mask and clearly disregarding physical distancing protocols, in a clear case of “rules for thee, but not for me.” (Related: Florida governor calls out hypocrisy of elites who flout mask mandates while insisting those around them wear masks.)\n\nTedros also pushing for more vaccines\n\nThe WHO director-general also took the opportunity to promote vaccines during the July 12 COVID-19 media briefing.\n\n“Vaccines have saved millions of lives,” said Tedros. “It’s important for governments to focus on boosting those most at-risk communities, finding the unvaccinated so as to build up the wall of immunity toward the 70 percent vaccination target.”\n\nDuring the G7 Summit where he was photographed without a face mask, Tedros warned that the one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses pledged by G7 leaders were too small for the 11 billion doses needed to vaccinate the world. He insisted that to truly end the pandemic, 70 percent of the world’s population must be injected with the vaccine.\n\nTedros continued that “planning and tackling COVID-19 should also go hand-in-hand with vaccinating for killer diseases like measles, pneumonia and diarrhea.” This endeavor, he remarked, is “not a question of either-or” as “it’s possible to do both.” He also urged the introduction of vaccines for malaria and HPV.\n\nAlexander also slammed Tedros’ insistence on vaccination to end the pandemic in his Substack post, calling the health official a “devil” and a “beast.”\n\nThe epidemiologist wrote that Tedros, just like Dr. Rochelle Walensky of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha, knows “full well” that the vaccine is actually responsible for the pandemic. The shots, Alexander said, place “sub-optimal immune pressure on the [SARS-CoV-2] spike protein, driving (the) emergence of variants and expanding the pandemic.”\n\n“The pandemic will last 100 more years if this continues,” warned Alexander.\n\nWatch WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus delivering his opening remarks at the July 12 media briefing below.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWHO backtracks on coronavirus vaccines, admits they won’t work.\n\nFace masks offer no protection from the coronavirus to the people who wear them – study.\n\nThe WHO wants to push COVID-19 vaccines on billions of people as part of Accelerator program.\n\nWORTHLESS MASKS: We always knew the masks were about control, not safety… now we’ve been proven right.\n\nSources include:\n\nInfoWars.com\n\nWHO.int\n\nPAlexander.Substack.com\n\nEuronews.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA’s “future framework” can let Big Pharma bypass testing for vaccine efficacy and safety\n\nThe influence of drug giants like Pfizer over the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been so significant that the world is now at the point where thorough testing for life-altering drugs such as experimental mRNA injections is no longer required.\n\nThe FDA adopted a “future framework” scheme that will allow Big Pharma companies to reformulate and release updated Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines without conducting any additional clinical trials. The framework permits the rollout of reformulated and completely untested vaccines in the United States.\n\nThe framework is not only limited to COVID-19 vaccines. The elimination of clinical trial requirements may also be expanded to other drugs and vaccines over time.\n\nWhile many examples of rigged vaccine trials had been recorded over the years, the future framework served as an extreme expansion and formalization of the scheme.\n\nSuch rigging involves improperly recording vaccine injuries, if not failing to record them altogether. The exclusion of parameters that turn out to be problematic, which could include injured trial participants, serves as another method.\n\nThis rigging has already occurred in Pfizer’s pediatric clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine. During the trial, the vaccine maker excluded 3,000 of 4,526 children aged between six months and four years old who were enrolled as participants – a clear red flag. (Related: JAB ‘EM YOUNG: FDA approves Pfizer’s booster vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 without consulting vaccine advisory panel.)\n\nFurthermore, the FDA’s future framework also includes the component of a COVID-19 booster dose specific to the B11529 omicron variant, which 19 of the 21 members of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted in favor of. The VRBPAC defended its decision, arguing that the modified vaccine would offer broader protection to match the circulating BA4 and BA5 omicron subvariants.\n\nMore conversations about boosters necessary moving forward\n\nDr. Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said there will be a conversation going forward to determine who will need another booster, or what the booster will look like. He did note, however, that a bivalent vaccine targeting the BA4 and BA5 subvariants seem to be the preference for the committee.\n\nDuring the VRBPAC’s meeting in April, the committee members agreed on the necessity of developing a framework for how the country can keep up with the evolving virus with an appropriate vaccine strategy. The FDA also said in May that the new normal may include an annual COVID-19 and flu shot for people, as cases are expected to rise in the fall and winter.\n\nCurrent COVID-19 vaccines are based on the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019, but Pfizer and its competitor Moderna have been working on updated versions as the current ones are not as effective against the omicron subvariants.\n\nFollowing the VRBPAC vote, the FDA will decide on the updated vaccine with a panel of independent experts that advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take a closer look at the available data and make recommendations. These recommendations would then head to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who will decide and sign off on them.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more updates about new vaccines for COVID-19 and more.\n\nWatch the video below for more information about the FDA’s future framework.\n\n\n\nThis video is from the What is happening channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nGreat Britain MP encourages workplaces and social venues to require vaccination proof from the public.\n\nBritish authorities slammed for their SLOW RESPONSE over AstraZeneca vaccine side effects.\n\nRecently released Pfizer document shows mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can cause 1,291 different adverse events.\n\nLeaked top-secret Pfizer document shows COVID-19 vaccine is FAR MORE DANGEROUS than the world knows.\n\nRoadway checkpoints for covid “vaccine” compliance rolling out in Austria… purebloods to be HUNTED by police.\n\nSources include:\n\nBlacklistedNews.com\n\nWXII12.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Zuckerberg warns that COVID-19 vaccines are “experimental” and “unproven” in a leaked video (but Facebook bans you if you say the same thing)\n\nA leaked video of Meta Platforms, Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed him cautioning his inner circle of the unproven effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines he called “experimental gene technology.”\n\nAware of the unsubstantiated curing effects and potential dangers of the vaccines, the tech giant chief felt compelled to alert his people regarding the shots on July 16, 2020 – five months before the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I just want to make sure that I share some caution on this [vaccine] because we just don’t know the long-term side-effects of basically modifying people’s DNA and RNA to directly encode in a person’s DNA and RNA basically the ability to produce those antibodies and whether that causes other mutations or other risks downstream,” Zuckerberg said in the leaked video, which was taken during an internal meeting at Facebook (FB).\n\nProject Veritas founder James O’Keefe noted during the release of the video last year that Zuckerberg would have been “censored on the platform” if what he said to his staff in July was posted on Facebook. He would be “basically violating his own code of conduct,” O’Keefe said.\n\n“It is yet another case of ‘one rule for thee, and another for me’ that the elite use to control the masses,” news website News Punch said.\n\nBack in 2019, the media magnate spoke in front of students at Georgetown University about the importance of protecting free expression. He highlighted his belief that giving everyone a voice gives power to the powerless and pushes society to be better over time – a belief that is at the core of Facebook, he said.\n\nHowever, the freedom to express has been throttled on Facebook and the other major social media platforms in recent years.\n\nMeta had censored 20 million posts since start of pandemic\n\nLast year, FB and Instagram (IG), which is also under the Meta Platforms umbrella, banned major groups, accounts and IG pages for speaking out and raising concerns and doubts about the vaccines’ adverse effects.\n\nAccording to a Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Report last year, FB removed 65 of its own and 243 IG accounts for spreading “misinformation” about the COVID-19 vaccines. They have removed more than 20 million individual posts since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with CBS in August last year, TV anchor Gayle King asked Zuckerberg to release information on how many people have viewed and shared FB posts containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHe admitted that FB has removed millions of posts containing misinformation from their website, but failed to answer when pressed by the host on how many people viewed or shared these posts.\n\n“I think, to some degree, there are also different definitions that people have over what misinformation is. A lot of the stuff that’s actually the hardest for us to really address is not what I would call ‘misinformation’ but instead another category that I would call ‘hesitancy,'” he said at the time. (Related: House Republicans demand Zuckerberg surrender all communications with Fauci over covid-19 and “vaccine hesitancy” censorship.)\n\nOne of the well-known personalities that have been banned from social media is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who emerged as one of the most influential voices during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKennedy Jr., who describes himself as a vaccine safety advocate, was not impressed with Bill Gates’ track record of pushing vaccines on vulnerable populations, causing serious health problems in some cases.

        "Now it’s the “ninja” variant of COVID they want you to be scared of: WILL IT EVER END?\n\nIt almost reads like satire, but the corporate-controlled media claims that a brand new variant of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which they are hilariously calling “ninja,” is on the move – and it is the most dangerous one yet, we are told.\n\nBA.5, as they are also calling it, is said to be a “subvariant” of the “Omicron” variant, which is an anagram for the Moronic variant. Yes, they really expect people to believe that a Moronic Ninja will kill us all if we do not mask up again and get “boosted” repeatedly.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), headed by private corporation headed up by Big Pharma plant Rochelle Walensky, insists that the Moronic Ninja subvariant serves as “a strong reminder the COVID pandemic isn’t over.”\n\nJust as a quick note: When you need to manufacture new fake scares like this to remind people that something that is clearly over is somehow not over, then you know that thing really is over.\n\nThe “ninja” variant is about selling more vaccines and boosters to keep the cash flowing to Big Pharma\n\nSo far, the only advice being dispensed by the corporate-controlled media to combat the Moronic Ninja is to keep getting vaccinated and boosted on a regular schedule.\n\nEven though the jabs have never once been shown to do anything other than make covid believers feel virtuous, they are still being dubbed the “best defense” against the never-ending covid scam, which in addition to depopulation appears to be all about the money for Big Pharma.\n\n“There are even Omicron-specific booster jabs in development that, in coming months, could make the best vaccines more effective against BA.5 and its genetic cousins,” one fake news media outlet reported, demonstrating that this is just another money grab disguised as public health.\n\n“BA.5’s widespread mutations made the subvariant less recognizable to all those antibodies we’ve built up from vaccines, boosters and past infection. BA.5 has been able to slip past our immune system, ninja-style, contributing to the rising rate of breakthrough cases and infections.”\n\nThe article goes on to state in no uncertain terms that the goal is to keep people scared and getting boosted forever. It quite literally states that the more “additional jabs” a person gets “on top of your prime course, the better protected you are.”\n\nAmazingly, they are still blaming the so-called COVID illness on a “stubborn anti-vax minority,” even though the only people getting sick are people who took the many jabs and are still getting sick from them.\n\nDr. Ben Marble, the founder of MyFreeDoctor, says that every new “variant” that emerges (assuming any of them are even real) is a product of “the C-19 fake vaccine poison.”\n\n“The people who have gotten three and four shots, they are the ones filling up the hospitals. An overwhelming majority of hospitalized people with COVID are people who took the shot,” Marble is quoted as saying.\n\n“Unvaccinated people don’t get that sick. The bottom line is the more doses of the poison shot you’ve taken, the sicker you are going to be and the more likely you’re going to die soon.”\n\nJabbing people during an outbreak, it turns out, “always create[s] mutations,” Marble further stated, calling the release of the Moronic variant “bioterrorism.”\n\nThe original so-called virus was also a bioweapon, by the way. The whole thing was contrived, just like the newest Moronic Ninja variant – and apparently, some people are still falling for it.\n\nThe latest news about the never-ending cash cow known as the COVID plandemic can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Governments that mandated deadly covid vaccines now blaming DOCTORS for not telling patients about the risks\n\nAfter becoming the first country in the world to mandate Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” on all citizens, Austria is now trying to shift responsibility onto doctors for all the health damage that resulted.\n\nAustrian Green Minister of Health Johannes Rauch says physicians, and not himself and his fellow politicians, are to blame for all the injuries and deaths because they failed to warn their patients about the risks involved with getting injected.\n\nNever mind the fact that these patients had no choice but to get them – and doctors were basically required to give them. In Rauch’s mind, it is someone else’s fault that thousands of Austrians are now dead or permanently injured because of the policies he helped create.\n\nThe SuperSpreader Substack is calling Rauch’s blame game the “most epic throwing under the bus to save your own a** of our generation” – and he is right. Not only is Rauch’s claim nonsensical, but it absolutely shows that the plandemic is crumbling to pieces at a rapid pace.\n\n“Anyone paying attention already understands that once the bodies start piling up the REAL fireworks will begin,” the “Mole” Substack adds.\n\n“We will see frantic finger pointing and rabid blame shifting. Screeching turned up to 11 competing with a word vomit of lies about who said what and when. It will be something spectacular to behold.”\n\nIf Austrian doctors had reported jab injuries, they would have lost their licenses\n\nIt turns out that there was never even a way for Austrian doctors to warn their patients about the risks involved, seeing as how those risks were concealed by politicians and their Big Pharma buddies who wanted the truth to be kept under wraps.\n\nNot only that, but doctors in Austria are not even allowed to report vaccine damage, even in suspected cases. This is due to “strict instructions from the medical association,” one person in the know tweeted.\n\n“Anyone who violates this is revoked the right to ordain,” the tweet further explains.\n\nNone of this was revealed by the corporate-controlled media, however. Headlines all around the world cited Rauch’s claim that the “medical profession” is to blame for covid jab injuries and deaths.\n\nOne headline declared that Rauch dropped a “liability hammer” by supposedly “confirming” that “doctors are responsible for vaccine damage” simply because they were the ones who were told to stick the injections into people’s arms, or else.\n\n“He seems to be trying to pull his own head out of the ever-tightening noose and to want to shirk responsibility,” one critical report said about Rauch’s shifting of blame.\n\n“Although he prescribes the ‘vaccinations,’ liability is shifted entirely to the medical profession.”\n\nDoctors face fines of up to 14,000 euros for covid “vaccine” injuries and deaths\n\nLaying blame on doctors is apparently not enough for Rauch. He also supports penalizing doctors up to 14,000 euros for their role in administering the jabs that caused many to become injured or die.\n\nEven though Austrian doctors basically had no choice in the matter, except to refuse and lose their medical licenses, Rauch stated that he is not responsible at all and that doctors need to pay a price.\n\n“The scope of medical education has been shown in the Austrian vaccination plan for years and I can assume that doctors work in accordance with the recommendations and the state of the art,” Rauch is quoted as saying, claiming innocence in the matter.\n\nIn essence, Rauch is saying that doctors should have avoided listening to him and instead done their own due diligence into the shots to see if they really were “safe and effective” like Rauch and others claimed.\n\n“The function of the information is to protect the freedom of decision of the person concerned,” one report explains. “This can be punished under administrative and / or disciplinary law as well as have consequences under liability law.”\n\nIf Rauch’s perspective becomes the Austrian government’s official position, then doctors all across that country could face lawsuits in the coming months and years over the role they apparently played in deceiving the masses into rolling up their sleeves for deadly “medicine.”\n\n“That is rich after their government even mulled a vax mandate for all adults and tried to silence all critics,” wrote a reader at the “Mole” Substack.\n\n“He’s right about the fact that medical doctors who failed to inform patients of the risks betrayed their medical responsibility,” suggested another. “However, a governing board that threatened the licenses of doctors who were true to their medical responsibilities are also to blame.”\n\nAnother also blamed the media for “just following orders” and reporting whatever the government and Big Pharma told them to.\n\n“This is all about good versus evil,” this person added. “And all will be judged.”\n\nThe latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” program can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nMole.substack.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Jacinda Ardern admits New Zealand is struggling to deal with COVID-19 pandemic despite high vaccination rate\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has admitted that the country is still struggling to deal with Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases despite its high vaccination rate.\n\nAccording to leading public health researcher Michael Baker, New Zealand is “losing the arms race with the virus.” COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed within the last week or so in an “abrupt rise.”\n\nBaker warned that the odds are against New Zealand and reports show that hospitals in the country are getting overwhelmed. Data from New Zealand also show that coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are decreasing among the unvaccinated but increasing among the vaccinated.\n\nHowever, Baker is still calling for new mRNA vaccines to be rolled out urgently while using terminology usually associated with wartime.\n\nProfessor John Gibson, an economist at Waikato University, published a paper revealing that boosters are ineffective and that the excess mortality in New Zealand highlights an alarming health deficit among people who are vaccinated.\n\nSimilar trends in other countries have been recorded among the young and working age.\n\nBut why is this kind of analysis not being taken seriously? (Related: Jacinda Ardern leads the way with disinformation.)\n\nThe great biotechnology scam\n\nFor many years pressure had been building to adopt biotechnology in agriculture and food, then in medicine and in weaponry. For people who wanted to gain the most, the potential profits were huge. After all, food and medicine are the global markets that flourish regardless of whether things are fine or not.\n\nThe release in 2019 of COVID-19, a novel biotech pathogen, was the first attack in a completely new type of global warfare. Biotech vaccines were advertised as defensive weapons that everyone needed, so the whole economic process was turned over to vaccine production and promotion.\n\nIn countries like New Zealand, political parties closed ranks behind the war effort. Government propaganda insisted that if you loved your country and your people, you would get vaccinated. If you chose not to get vaccinated, you would suffer consequences.\n\nPeople who allowed themselves to get vaccinated thus became heroes, while those who suffered vaccine injuries were ignored.\n\nInstead of being protected, the young were forced into the front lines. They were at little or no risk from coronavirus infection, but they were exposed nonetheless to a significant and measurable risk of cardiac damage through mRNA vaccination.\n\nSo why did people allow this to happen? Because of government deception and fearmongering. Also because Big Pharma published lies and false scientific data claiming that vaccine-induced immunity would “shield” society from possible infection.\n\nCensorship and propaganda amid the pandemic\n\nMeanwhile, experts who spoke up against vaccine mandates and other draconian pandemic measures were punished and censored. Politicians also fought to appear the most committed and the most generous with funding.\n\nThere are several trends within the social psychology of war, like profiteers, sadists, rumormongers and mainstream media that faithfully repeat what the government orders them to. These were all in play amid the pandemic.\n\nWhile the battle between human immunity and pathogens is an age-old conflict that humans have always won, now majority of the people have allowed their flexible immune systems to be exposed to a prescriptive mRNA vaccine designed in a lab that wasn’t sufficiently tested.\n\nProtestors have asked the government to give back their right to make their own medical choices, but the government insists on telling people what to do.\n\nWhile the first pandemic war is backed by political, financial and authoritarian ambitions, the only way to end it is for those responsible from all sides to use their common sense. Pausing biotechnology experimentation and vaccinations is the only way to ensure peace and the safety of the public.\n\nVisit Pandemic.news to learn how other countries are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about how Jacinda Ardern is spreading disinformation in New Zealand.\n\nThis video is from the Free4eva Media channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nNew Zealand lifts majority of COVID-19 restrictions amid skyrocketing cases.\n\nNew Zealand court threatens to seize property over non-payment of fine for COVID testing “non-compliance.”\n\nNZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern says vaccine side effects are PROOF the vaccine is working: Does this include heart attacks and death?\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nHatchardReport.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Hepatitis outbreak of unknown cause among children a direct result of AstraZeneca’s COVID “vaccine,” says virologist\n\nA respected virologist-immunologist has written a letter to the esteemed British Medical Journal (BMJ) explaining that a new outbreak of “acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children” is a direct result of AstraZeneca’s viral vector Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine.”\n\nMillions of children in the United Kingdom were injected with the poison, which an earlier study published in the Journal of Hepatology confirmed is causing many of them to develop severe liver damage – in some cases requiring an urgent liver transplant.\n\nDr. Ann-Cathrin Engwall said that adenovirus infections, which are present in 70 percent of affected children, could be the cause of acute hepatitis in children observed – even though adenovirus infections do not normally cause hepatitis in healthy children.\n\nThis strange phenomenon, she said, could point to “a completely new type of adenovirus that might have been introduced into the human population.”\n\n“A substantial proportion of the population in the U.K. has received Vaxzevria which is an adenovirus vector vaccine from AstraZeneca developed by the Jenner Institute in Oxford,” Dr. Engwall wrote in her letter, citing research on the subject.\n\n“The chimpanzee viral vector was selected due to the low herd immunity in the human population and originates from an adenovirus purified from the feces of chimpanzee cubs.”\n\nMad Franken-scientists think they are gods, and children are paying the price\n\nThe vector itself is genetically engineered, she went on to explain, noting that it cannot multiply on its own. This allows “genes of interest” to be added, which in the case of Vaxzevria is supposedly the DNA sequence expressing the spike protein from the original SARS-CoV-2.\n\n“Could the adenovirus vector vaccine have contributed to a new recombinant virus?” Dr. Engwall asked.\n\n“Even if the virus vector does not multiply, there is an obvious risk exposing such a large number of individuals that recombination with an adenovirus could occur.”\n\nIt turns out that a survival mechanism for adenoviruses known as multiplicity reactivation (MR) was discovered back in 1971 by Japanese researchers, who observed that damaged adenovirus genomes can interact with other adenoviruses in a cell to form a new viable viral genome.\n\n“The mechanism is described as an early variant of a reproductive (sexual) process that can occur in microorganisms,” Dr. Engwall explained. “A proportion of the population, especially individuals with a compromised immune system, is carrying latent adenoviruses.”\n\n“In Sweden, approximately 20 percent of adults and 50 percent of kindergarten children are carriers. This safety issue of viral-vector delivery systems was often discussed in the beginning of the development of these medical tools.”\n\nThe mass introduction of adenovirus vector vaccines on the heels of the plandemic represents a first in human history. Thus, the risk for recombination with adenoviruses is massively increased – which explains the sudden and seemingly out-of-nowhere appearance of hepatitis in fully-injected children.\n\nThe really sad thing is that if these viral vector injections are in fact the cause of acute hepatitis in children, then the symptoms they are experiencing now “could just be the tip of the iceberg,” Dr. Engwall warned.\n\n“The virus may have spread to other countries from the U.K., but it is also possible that adenovirus recombinations may have occurred independently elsewhere in the world where adenovirus vector vaccines also have been used,” she added in her letter.\n\n“Development of a new more pathogenic adenovirus could be caused by using adenovirus vector vaccines in large populations, and it is consistent with the facts available. To investigate this important safety issue of viral vector vaccines, sequencing of entire adenovirus genomes from cases and comparisons with the vaccine viral vector is necessary to verify or dismiss this hypothesis.”\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "How Pfizer profited from the pandemic\n\nSTORY AT-A-GLANCE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a real boon to Pfizer. Not only has it doubled Pfizer’s annual revenue, it has also given the drugmaker unique weight in determining U.S. health policy — something that concerns even staunch vaccine-pushers like Dr. Paul Offit\n\nPfizer’s revenue in 2021 was $81.3 billion — approximately double that of 2020 — and the COVID shot accounted for $36.78 billion of that\n\nPfizer’s COVID jab dominates 70% of the U.S. and European markets, and Paxlovid, its COVID drug, has become a standard treatment choice in hospitals. This despite findings showing the shot doesn’t prevent infection or transmission, and that Paxlovid causes severe rebound and supercharges mutations\n\nThe U.S. had thrown away 82.2 million expired COVID jab doses as of mid-May 2022, yet the Biden administration ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022 for a fall booster campaign that will cost taxpayers $3.2 billion\n\nPfizer’s contracts are almost exclusively slanted in Pfizer’s favor. They’re guaranteed payment while having no financial liability for injuries and deaths, and it appears this indemnification applies even if they were to be found guilty of fraud\n\n(Article by Dr. Joseph Mercola republished from Articles.Mercola.com)\n\nAccording to Kaiser Health News (KHN),1 the COVID-19 pandemic has been a real boon to Pfizer. Not only has it yielded “outsize benefits” in terms of profits, but it has also “given the drugmaker unusual weight in determining U.S. health policy.”\n\n“Based on internal research, the company’s executives have frequently announced the next stage in the fight against the pandemic before government officials have had time to study the issue, annoying many experts in the medical field and leaving some patients unsure whom to trust,” KHN reporter Arthur Allen writes, adding:2\n\n“When last year Bourla suggested that a booster shot would soon be needed, U.S. public health officials later followed, giving the impression that Pfizer was calling the tune.\n\nSome public health experts and scientists worry these decisions were hasty, noting, for example, that although boosters with the mRNA shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech improve antibody protection initially, it generally doesn’t last.\n\nSince January, Bourla has been saying that U.S. adults will probably all need annual booster shots, and senior FDA officials have indicated since April that they agree … The company’s power worries some vaccinologists, who see its growing influence in a realm of medical decision-making traditionally led by independent experts …\n\nWhen President Biden in September 2021 offered boosters to Americans — not long after [Pfizer CEO Albert] Bourla had recommended them — Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia … wondered, ‘Where’s the evidence you are at risk of serious disease when confronted with COVID if you are vaccinated and under 50?’ Policies on booster recommendations for different groups are complex and shifting, Offit said, but the CDC, rather than Bourla and Pfizer, should be making them. ‘We’re being pushed along,’ he said. ‘The pharmaceutical companies are acting like public health agencies.’”\n\nThe fact that a vaccine-pusher like Offit — infamous for claiming a baby can safely tolerate 10,000 vaccines at once3 — is questioning and pushing back against Pfizer’s influence over health policy reveals just how brazen, unethical and potentially dangerous that is.\n\nMassive Profits Made From Useless Products\n\nAccording to Allen, Pfizer’s revenue in 2021 was $81.3 billion4 — approximately double that of 2020 — and the COVID shot accounted for $36.78 billion5 of that. For comparison, Lipitor, Pfizer’s previous top selling statin, generates roughly $2 billion a year,6 while their strep vaccine, Prevnar 13 rakes in $6 billion a year.7\n\nIts mRNA gene transfer injection against COVID now dominates 70% of the U.S. and European markets, and Paxlovid, Pfizer’s COVID drug, has become a standard treatment choice in hospitals. This, despite researchers finding Paxlovid (molnupiravir) causes severe rebound and supercharges mutations.\n\nIn a rational scenario, that finding would have put a stop to its use, but no. In an official health advisory8 to the public, issued May 24, 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first warns that Paxlovid is associated with “recurrence of COVID-19 or ‘COVID-19 rebound,’” and then in the very next sentence stresses in bold print a narrative supporting its use and enriching Pfizer with instructions saying:\n\n“Paxlovid continues to be recommended for early- stage treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 among persons at high risk for progression to severe disease.”\n\nAllen also notes that, during an investor call, a Pfizer official highlighted reports of Paxlovid’s failure, but spun it into “good news” for investors, as patients may require multiple courses!9 Obviously the objective has long ago shifted from helping humans to raping them for as much profit as possible.\n\nSimilarly, while Pfizer’s COVID jab clearly doesn’t prevent infection or spread, and Americans are rejecting the shots in growing numbers — 82.2 million doses had expired and were chucked in the trash as of mid-May 202210 — the U.S. government still went ahead and ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022.\n\nThese are intended for a fall booster campaign, at a cost to taxpayers of $3.2 billion.11 The U.S. is actually paying about 50% more for each of these new jab boosters this time around — $30.47 per dose compared to $19.50 per dose paid for the first 100 million doses.\n\nThe U.S. government has also promised to purchase another 20 million courses of Paxlovid, at an eye-watering cost of $530 per five-day course. Basically, Pfizer is being financially rewarded for producing products that are useless at best and dangerous at worst, and we’re all paying for it. In case you’re curious, that is another $10.6 billion transferred from U.S. taxpayers to Pfizer.\n\nFuture Boosters Won’t Undergo Human Clinical Trials\n\nAfter you likely thought it couldn’t ever get any worse, KHN also touches on, but doesn’t delve into, the fact that Pfizer suggested they skip human trials as they move forward with jabs that are reformulated for newer variants. If this strikes you as crazy, you’d be right. It’s sheer madness, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — a clearly captured agency — has already surreptitiously agreed to this egregious miscarriage of science.\n\nHow this wicked scheme, known as the “Future Framework,”12 was adopted by the FDA without formal vote is explained by Toby Rogers, Ph.D. — a political economist whose research focus is on regulatory capture and Big Pharma corruption13 — in the video above. He also explained it in a June 29, 2022, Substack article:14\n\n“Yesterday [June 28], the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee approved a bivalent COVID-19 shot with the Wuhan strain and the Omicron variant … Wait, hold up, I thought the FDA was voting on the Future Framework yesterday?\n\nThe policy question was whether reformulated COVID-19 shots would be treated as new molecular entities (which they are) in which case they should be subject to formal review or whether reformulated shots would be treated as ‘biologically similar’ to existing Covid-19 shots and be allowed to skip clinical trials altogether.\n\nApparently the FDA did not have the votes to just pass this as a policy question. If you ask anyone whether reformulated mRNA represents a new molecular entity, well of course it is, so that would require formal regulatory review.\n\nWhat the FDA did instead was to smuggle the policy question in disguised as a vote about reformulated ‘boosters’ for the fall.\n\nIn essence, the FDA just started doing the Future Framework (picking variants willy nilly, skipping clinical trials) and essentially dared the committee members to turn down a booster dose — knowing that all of the VRBPAC members are hand-picked because they’ve never met a vaccine they did not like.\n\nSo of course only two people on the committee had the courage to turn down a booster dose — even though it was based on this preposterous process (that was never formally adopted) where there was literally no data at all … By stealth, the FDA replaced a system based on evidence with a system based entirely on belief.”\n\nCountries Held to Ransom\n\nIn 2021, secret details of Pfizer’s contracts came to light, showing they are essentially holding countries hostage to nonnegotiable demands for payment in full AND freedom from liability.15\n\nIn late February 2021, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported16 that Pfizer was demanding countries put up sovereign assets as collateral for expected vaccine injury lawsuits resulting from its COVID-19 jab.\n\nSeveral countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Peru, agreed to this demand, putting up bank reserves, military bases and embassy buildings as collateral. In short, theses governments are guaranteeing Pfizer will be compensated for any expenses resulting from injury lawsuits against it, so the company won’t lose a dime if its COVID shot injures people.\n\nShockingly, these terms are binding even if those injuries are the result of negligent company practices, fraud or malice!\n\nGovernment purchasers must acknowledge that the effectiveness and safety of the shots are completely unknown, all while indemnifying Pfizer against any and all financial liability.\n\nIn October that same year, Public Citizen published the secret contracts17,18 between Pfizer and Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Dominican Republic, the European Commission, Peru, the U.S. and the U.K., further revealing the extent to which these countries handed power over to Pfizer. In almost all scenarios, Pfizer’s interests come first.\n\nFor example, government purchasers must acknowledge that the effectiveness and safety of the shots are completely unknown, all while indemnifying Pfizer against any and all financial liability. This is the ultimate corporate maleficence, using their leverage to force the kill shot down these countries’ throats and avoiding any personal responsibility for damages.\n\nEven if Pfizer eventually is convicted of fraud in the U.S. and loses all its liability protection from the COVID jabs because of it, that judgment would not impact these foreign contracts. These countries sold their souls to Pfizer and have absolutely no recourse but to pay even if the shots kill everyone.\n\nThe contracts for at least four countries also secure Pfizer’s intellectual property rights even if the company is found to have stolen intellectual property rights of others. In such case, the government purchaser becomes the liable party. As explained by Public Citizen:19\n\n“For example, if another vaccine maker sued Pfizer for patent infringement in Colombia, the contract requires the Colombian government to foot the bill. Pfizer also explicitly says that it does not guarantee that its product does not violate third-party IP, or that it needs additional licenses.\n\nPfizer takes no responsibility in these contracts for its potential infringement of intellectual property. In a sense, Pfizer has secured an IP waiver for itself. But internationally, Pfizer is fighting similar efforts to waive IP barriers for all manufacturers.”\n\nEqually shocking is that countries are forced to follow through on their vaccine orders even if other drugs or treatments emerge that can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19.20 Is it any wonder, then, that governments around the world have suppressed the use of safe and effective outpatient drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin?\n\nIf these drugs were allowed to be used and could be proven to work, the COVID injections would be completely unnecessary and their emergency use authorization would disappear, yet governments are on the hook for hundreds of millions of doses.\n\nPfizer Has ‘Habitual Offender’ Track Record\n\nThe fact that Pfizer has behaved like a criminal who works out a cover story for a planned murder before committing it is not surprising, considering its history. Pfizer, has been sued in multiple venues over unethical behavior, including unethical drug testing and illegal marketing practices.21\n\nIn his 2010 paper,22 “Tough on Crime? Pfizer and the CIHR,” Robert G. Evans, Ph.D., Emeritus Professor at Vancouver School of Economics, described Pfizer as “a ‘habitual offender,’ persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results.”\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010 alone, Pfizer and its subsidiaries were fined $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards. They are recurrent criminal felons. None of these convictions has deterred their nefarious behavior.\n\nIn 2011, Pfizer agreed to pay another $14.5 million to settle federal charges of illegal marketing,23 and in 2014 they settled federal charges relating to improper marketing of the kidney transplant drug Rapamune to the tune of $35 million,24 as well as $75 million to settle charges relating to its testing of a new broad spectrum antibiotic on critically ill Nigerian children.\n\nAs reported by the Independent25 at the time, Pfizer sent a team of doctors into Nigeria in the midst of a meningitis epidemic. For two weeks, the team set up right next to a medical station run by Doctors Without Borders and began dispensing the experimental drug, Trovan. Of the 200 children picked, half got the experimental drug and the other half the already licensed antibiotic Rocephin.\n\nEleven of the children treated by the Pfizer team died, and many others suffered side effects such as brain damage and organ failure. Pfizer denied wrongdoing. According to the company, only five of the children given Trovan died, compared to six who received Rocephin, so their drug was not to blame.\n\nThe problem was they never told the parents that their children were being given an experimental drug. What’s more, while Pfizer produced a permission letter from a Nigerian ethics committee, the letter turned out to have been backdated. The ethics committee itself wasn’t set up until a year after the trial had already taken place. Pfizer’s rap sheet also includes bribery, environmental violations, labor and worker safety violations and more.26\n\nWolves in Sheep’s Clothing\n\nNow, despite Pfizer being one of the least ethical drug companies, we’re told to trust them with our very lives, and the lives of our precious children. They’re going to put out booster shots this fall that have undergone absolutely no testing whatsoever, and we’re to simply throw caution to the wind because Pfizer — which has no liability whatsoever — says so.\n\nIn 2014, Pfizer faced a surge of lawsuits that accused it of hiding known side effects of its anticholesterol drug Lipitor.27 They got off scot-free that time, as a federal judge dismissed thousands of cases alleging the drug caused Type 2 diabetes.28,29 But at least they had liability and could be sued.\n\nWhen it comes to the COVID jabs, injured patients and family members of those killed by it won’t even have the ability to sue for damages, as governments around the world have indemnified them completely, and it looks as though they might not even be liable even if they’re found guilty of fraud. But we will have to see what the courts rule on that one. Still, that any nation would agree to a contract like that is just mindboggling.\n\nMeanwhile, mounting evidence shows the COVID shots destroy immune function over time, and Pfizer’s own trial data reveal deaths and serious adverse events numbering in the tens of thousands.\n\nIt’s hard to tell who’s more deserving of punishment — Pfizer or the equally captured federal agencies, the FDA and the CDC, that go along with them and do nothing to protect the lives of the youngest members of our society. Clearly, it’s up to us to protect ourselves and our loved ones, because wolves in sheep’s clothing are ruling the roost — they’re making all the decisions, and captured agencies are simply doing their bidding.\n\nRead more at: Articles.Mercola.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "DEATH SHOTS: Canadian data show that COVID “vaccines” INCREASE the risk of death from covid\n\nNot only does Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) not protect against COVID, but official government data from the Canadian province of Manitoba show that the shots actually increase a person’s risk of death.\n\nThe latest figures available for May show that only nine percent of deaths and 14 percent of hospital admissions in the province were unvaccinated people, despite them representing 17 percent of the population.\n\nAn analysis of the data further shows that vaccinated, but unboosted people are about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die from covid compared to unvaccinated people (Related: Last summer, the Canadian government forced people to get injected in order to travel).\n\n“People who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated,” notes Alex Berenson about the data.\n\nTwo illustrative charts, which you can view on Berenson’s Substack, show that hospitalizations and deaths are most prominent among the fully jabbed, all things considered.\n\n“These figures and estimates differ markedly from those the Centers for Disease Control have provided for American COVID deaths,” Berenson further writes. “But they are likely to be far more accurate.”\n\n“American hospitals and health authorities classify COVID deaths and hospitalizations as occurring in the unvaccinated until proven otherwise.”\n\nHow many lives have been lost BECAUSE of covid vaccines?\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the American data collection model is that it relies on self-reporting within a system of privatized insurance. In Canada and elsewhere with nationalized health insurance, jab registries can more easily be matched against hospital admissions and deaths.\n\nIn every country where nationalized health care exists, it is obvious from the data that far more “fully vaccinated” people than unvaccinated people are getting sick and dying from what they are calling covid.\n\n“Still, the data from Manitoba appear to mark the first time that any government agency has actually found a higher risk of death in vaccinated people,” Berenson notes.\n\nThe Manitoba data fully implicate Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for crimes against humanity, seeing as how he was the ringleader in that country for mass injection.\n\n“When will Canadian citizens demand that Trudeau is arrested, tried and executed for blatant violations of the Nuremburg Code?” asked one of Berenson’s subscribers. “When will we all stop soft-pedaling genocide by globalist parasites?\n\nKeep in mind that Trudeau, like most politicians, is just a figurehead puppet who likely takes orders from some invisible entity far up above him. And they deserve the same prosecutorial treatment as he does.\n\n“They just approved the shots for children,” added another commenter about how the mass injection campaign is now targeting babies. “Where the FDA goes, Health Canada follows like the little corrupted lapdogs they are.”\n\n“It’s criminal to give these shots to babies and kids,” interjected someone else.\n\nSomeone else quoted Luke 17:1-2, which reads, citing the words of Jesus Christ himself:\n\n“Then said He unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone was hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones.”\n\nIf those who perpetrated and continue to perpetrate these crimes against humanity do not repent, then they deserve “nothing but incomprehensible, ineffable, unfathomable and unimaginable misery, pain, suffering, torment, wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Lake of Fire where the worm dies not and the fires are NEVER quenched,” this same commenter added, receiving an “Amen to that!” from another.\n\nThe latest news about the death toll from Fauci Flu shots can be found at Genocide.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nAlexBerenson.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "SPIKE PROTEIN SYNDROME is sweeping America as deadly disorders are springing up out of nowhere post COVID vaccination\n\nThe real pandemic the world is experiencing is the skyrocketing cases of preventable diseases literally caused and exacerbated by spike protein injections, also known as COVID-19 “vaccines.”\n\nResearch conducted by scientists found that spike proteins injected into the body and created by mRNA “technology” enter the bloodstream and travel to all parts of the body, accumulating and polluting cleansing organs, while causing blood clots.\n\nThis clotting and damage to the vascular system results in deadly conditions, including myocarditis, strokes, and yes, cancer. Cancer tumors are popping up at the site of injection, and increasing in the human body post COVID-19 vaccination. Coincidence?\n\nSpike proteins are dangerous toxins that can clog the entire vascular system\n\nPrion diseases and disorders are sweeping the nation and the world, but the medical industrial complex and the mass media (fake news MSM) are keeping a tight lid on the news and science that reveal this “pandemic” of vaccine-induced injuries and deaths. As mRNA injections reprogram human cells to continuously produce the spike protein prions, they continue accumulating throughout the body – possibly forever.\n\nScientists and coroners are finding high concentrations of these virus-mimicking prions in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, adrenal glands and the ovaries of COVID-vaccinated victims.\n\nBy the way, this is not some new revelation. Scientists are saying, “We have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation.” In fact, a large number of studies reflect that the damage from COVID-19 “vaccines” is causing much more health carnage than the virus itself.\n\nLab animals injected with spike proteins develop cardiovascular problems, and reveal that the spike protein prions cross the blood-brain barrier, causing brain damage.\n\nCOVID-19 spike protein injections suspected of causing mass deaths, including spontaneous abortions and miscarriages\n\nSpike protein injections cause potential risks to nursing babies and fertility, as research reveals, while birthrates coincidentally are plummeting globally. Bill Gates, who has openly supported population reduction of billions of people using vaccines and abortions, has auspiciously fully backed the spike protein injections for the pandemic. Is this because the prions cause the immune system to attack the fetus while damaging the ovaries, thus causing spontaneous abortions and miscarriages, limiting reproduction and also causing infertility?\n\nLike China, India, Japan and Brazil, the U.S. birthrate is well below the replacement rate, and for the birth rate of a country to simply remain the same, the rate needs to be slightly above two percent. This means that due to spike protein injections, the number of babies killed in the womb is reducing the world’s population considerably, just like Gates and all the other globalist eugenicists (his cohorts) want to do.\n\nColumbia University researchers found the death rate from Spike Protein Syndrome (SPS) is much higher than the Centers for Disease Continuance (CDC) claims, revealing at least 10 times the number of deaths the CDC says have resulted from Fauci death jabs. That total is now approaching half-a-million deaths from SPS, not just 20,000 or so.\n\nStill, that death count could be way low. Steve Kirsch, executive director of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF), ran an analysis based on VAERS statistics, plus data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and found the true death toll from the kill shots is double that amount, quickly approaching one million.\n\nIn other words, the number of deaths from the clot-shot “vaccines” is far higher than the number of deaths from the actual virus, assuming there even is one, since it’s never been isolated in a lab. This pandemic is a clot shot pandemic, not a virus-based one. That’s why everyone should avoid spike protein injections like the plague!\n\nBookmark Vaccines.news to your favorite independent websites for updates on experimental “vaccines” that cause blood clots, myocarditis and severe, chronic inflammation.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com 1\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nLifeSiteNews.com 2\n\nWEForum.org\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Calgary firefighters file $38 million lawsuit against city and fire department over covid “vaccine” mandates\n\nNineteen firefighters in Calgary who were fired for refusing Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” are now suing the department and the city for $38 million in damages.\n\nPlaintiffs say the Canadian city’s injection mandate “violated” their basic “human rights” by forcing them to alter their DNA in order to continue working and making a living.\n\n“There’s something tyrannical about these mandates,” says Stephen Dabbagh, the lawsuit’s leader. (Related: Canada’s covid jab mandate is why the trucker caravans were formed.)\n\n“We can’t identity everybody behind it, but what we can do is hold people accountable, like the fire chief, politicians, city managers. Those people are responsible for their actions.”\n\nDabbagh had worked as a firefighter at the Calgary Fire Department (CFD) for some 20 years, including most recently as a fire captain. He reportedly resigned under duress on Dec. 8, 2021 after being told that he had to take the jab.\n\nUnwilling to let that stand without a fight, Dabbagh and 18 of his colleagues banded together to try to stop the “political and ideological tyranny of these mandates.”\n\n“It’s about trying to hold people (politicians, bureaucrats) accountable for their actions,” Dabbagh told LifeSiteNews.\n\nThe suit’s Statement of Claim was delivered to the City of Calgary and CFD on July 7 in the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta.\n\nMore lawsuits like this need to be filed\n\nA portion of the suit, $2 million, aims to cover damages for mental duress and violations of the firefighters’ Charter rights under the Criminal Code for “Punitive and exemplary damages.”\n\n“By forcing its loyal employees to take experimental injections as a requisite to employment, the City has breached its legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to its Employees contrary to section 217.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada,” the lawsuit reads.\n\n“The Plaintiffs have suffered measurable damages, including mental distress, anxiety, and, in particular, injury to dignity and self-respect. The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to significant damages due to the manner in which the City suspended their employment, including a claim for punitive aggravated damages arising from flagrant human rights and Charter violations.”\n\nAll city employees in Calgary, including firefighters, were told back in the fall of 2021 that they had to get jabbed for the Fauci Flu and show proof of it or else submit to constant “testing,” which involves an invasive cotton swab being shoved up the nose.\n\nThere were also limited exemptions available, though not many qualified for those.\n\nIn March of 2022, Calgary’s covid jab mandate was “suspended,” but it was already too late for Dabbagh and his colleagues. Their goal now is to get paid for what they had to endure, as well as to stop this type of tyranny from ever being imposed again.\n\n“The law says we have these rights (to refuse the jabs via Canada’s Charter) even if they are not being upheld by the courts,” Dabbagh says.\n\n“For me, it is using every avenue to fight against the political and ideology tyranny of these mandates … These medications, or whatever they are called, are not safe and did not work.”\n\nNearly all of the firefighters named in the suit have worked as city firefighters for a long time. One of them was fired simply for showing support for the Freedom Convoy, which is a violation of rights all on its own.\n\nSome of the firefighters have returned to work but under duress. They are still named in the lawsuit because their human rights have been impacted, and “even people who were on leave at the time have still suffered human rights violations,” says Alberta lawyer Leighton Gray, who is representing the firefighters in the case.\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at Immunization.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Thousands of non-COVID excess deaths in the UK likely caused by COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe latest data from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) has raised a lot of questions due to the sudden appearance of over 8,750 excess deaths from causes other than the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), with many questioning whether the vaccines caused these deaths.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the government received reports of 10,357 registered deaths in the week ending on July 1. This represents 1,128 – or 12.2 percent – more deaths above the five-year average. Of these deaths, only 332 were registered with COVID-19 as a contributory cause and 212 were registered with COVID-19 as the underlying cause. The remaining 916 excess deaths were not officially attributed to COVID-19.\n\nThis brings the total non-COVID-19 excess deaths in England and Wales in the 10 weeks since the recent coronavirus spike in late April to 8,756 deaths. (Related: European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system.)\n\nExperts who have noticed this spike in excess deaths have called for an urgent investigation to figure out what is causing this alarming trend.\n\nThe experts have also noted that there is a strong correlation between the rise in deaths and the beginning of the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine doses during the government’s spring booster campaign among people over the age of 75 in England. They believe this connection needs to be investigated.\n\nBut the British government has yet to signal an intent to conduct investigation or even offer any kind of explanation regarding the high rate of excess deaths. The total number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths in the U.K. is decreasing, meaning that the current wave – likely due to the vaccines – is easing.\n\nONS data shows over 200,000 deaths allegedly due to COVID-19\n\nThe latest data from the ONS shows that more than 200,000 people in the U.K. have allegedly died due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began in early 2020. This monumental mark was reached on June 25, but was only confirmed recently due to the time it takes for deaths to be registered with the statistics office.\n\nThe British government is admitting these deaths while at the same time boasting about the fact that the U.K. has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 75 percent of the population fully vaccinated and 60 percent boosted.\n\nThe registered deaths – totaling 200,247 deaths – were only counted if COVID-19 was mentioned on their death certificates, either as a main cause of death or a contributory factor. This strongly suggests that the British government may be hiding more deaths either due to COVID-19 or due to the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a lobbying group, called the breaching of the 200,000 mark “a tragedy” and “damning” evidence of the British government’s failure to properly handle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDr. Michael Head, senior research fellow for global health at the University of Southampton, said that the “vast majority” of the more than 200,000 deaths were preventable, but they occurred due to policy failures at the national level.\n\n“It’s important to remember that, for every death, there will be many more hospitalizations, long COVID and other indirect burdens such as greater impact on other areas of the U.K. health service and socioeconomic consequences such as bereavements and inability to work,” said Head. “Recorded COVID-19 deaths are the tip of a very unpleasant and far-reaching iceberg.”\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this video of David Icke explaining how the so-called “emerging diseases” are a way to cover up COVID-19 vaccine injuries and deaths.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nCanadian study confirms mRNA vaccines increase risk of myocarditis, especially in young men after second dose.\n\nQatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.\n\nHong Kong medical experts find evidence suggesting COVID-19 vaccines cause heart disease.\n\nThe late Dr. Zev Zelenko: COVID-19 vaccines were meant to keep people in state of mass psychosis.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: COVID-19 should be fought with early intervention, not vaccines.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nONS.gov.uk\n\nIndependent.co.uk\n\nNYTimes.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Ex-employees sue Disney for rejecting religious exemptions for COVID shots\n\nThree former employees of The Walt Disney Company filed a complaint alleging that the media giant rejected religious exemptions to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination.\n\nThe plaintiffs – Barbara Andreas, Stephen Cribb and Adam Pajer – accused Disney of violating their religious liberty protections. They were terminated for declining to be injected with the COVID-19 vaccines, even though they filed exemption forms clearly stating that “taking these injections would violate their deeply-held convictions.”\n\nThe three plaintiffs, who hailed from Florida, indicated in their June 29 lawsuit that they first reported Disney to the office of Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody prior to their termination. They accused the media conglomerate of violating an edict by Gov. Ron DeSantis that banned employers from imposing vaccine mandates on their workers. Andreas, Cribb and Pajer subsequently pointed out that Disney fired them in retaliation to their complaints.\n\n“[While] Disney has brought wonder and magic into the lives and homes of millions, [it] had cast itself as the villain,” the lawsuit stated, adding that “a shadow has come over Disney” during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the three, Disney “announced to its entire U.S. cast a ‘vaccinate or terminate’ policy” on July 30, 2021. Employees were given a deadline of Sept. 30, 2021, to present proof of full vaccination – two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna or one dose of the Janssen vaccine – as a “condition of continued employment.”\n\nThe vaccine mandate initially applied to non-union employees as unionized Disney workers were able to exempt themselves through collective bargaining agreements. Disney later expanded this mandate to encompass all employees after negotiation with multiple staff unions.\n\nThe June 29 lawsuit also indicated “safety protocols for COVID-19” Disney put in place in its parks. The media giant closed its amusement parks in California and Florida on March 15, 2020 and reopened four months later. These precautions involved social distancing for cast members and guests, double masking and the use of face shields and goggles depending on “proximity to guests.”\n\nAndreas, Cribb and Pajer are seeking damages for lost wages, employee benefits and lawyer fees – alongside a request for a jury trial.\n\nFired cast members fighting for health freedom\n\nEarlier, the three plaintiffs announced their intent to sue Disney during a press conference in Kissimmee, Florida. They were accompanied by longtime Disney employee Nick Caturano and their respective attorneys. (Related: Cast members to sue Disney for its COVID-19 “vaccinate or terminate” mandate.)\n\n“Our lawsuit against these discriminatory practices will bring to light that the ‘happiest place on earth’ has normalized blatant discrimination, terrorized families, threatened livelihoods and coerced permanent, medical decisions – injections that cannot be ‘taken off’ at the end of a work day like a costume or pair of shoes,” Caturano said during the press conference.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted during the press conference that liberty is fragile and must be protected in the instance when mass fear is bred, adding: “When human life is less important than your job, you know that society has a problem.”\n\nCaturano, who has been with the media giant for almost two decades, penned an open letter questioning Disney’s decision to make COVID-19 vaccination compulsory.\n\n“When the vaccines were announced, I was skeptical about taking something that had no long-term data and was amazed at how quickly everyone claimed it was ‘safe and effective.’ My position – let’s wait and see how this plays out – seemed a reasonable position to take. I also respected and understood why many of my neighbors, friends and family members decided to get vaccinated,” he wrote.\n\n“We were all hopeful for anything that would work. But unfortunately, it’s evident that this vaccine and the people in charge of protecting Americans’ health and freedom have failed miserably,” Caturano concluded his letter.\n\nWatch Nick Caturano below discussing his fight against Disney’s vaccine mandates on “Lawfare with Tom Renz.”\n\nThis video is from the BrighteonTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nVaccinated employees test POSITIVE: Disney’s first test cruise delayed because of “inconsistent” coronavirus tests.\n\nMagic Kingdom of TYRANNY: Disney now ARRESTING its own guests who refuse covid temperature checks.\n\nDisney World employee talks about fighting vaccine mandates with Tom Renz – Brighteon.TV.\n\nDisney goes full authoritarian, demands mask obedience even while you’re walking and eating.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nWBTW.com\n\nUncoverDC.com\n\nGoofyVaccine.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "New Zealand doctors call for criminal homicide investigations into covid-19 vaccine deaths\n\nThe group New Zealand Doctors Speaking out With Science (NZDSOS) has published an open letter calling for a comprehensive investigation into the wave of deaths occurring in New Zealand among the “fully vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\nA redacted version is available for the public to read, while an unredacted version is still being carefully prepared for law enforcement to ensure it contains all of the necessary information for a proper investigation to be conducted.\n\nAccording to the group, there is a “shockingly large burden of deaths and injuries following the Covid-19 vaccine, of itself and compared to any other treatment or vaccine in modern times.”\n\n“We report many cases that DEMAND proper investigation, as befits any medication lacking safety studies,” the letter’s executive summary further states.\n\nNZDSOS says the country’s surveillance systems, which would otherwise catch these injuries and deaths, have been disabled “in order to hide the extent of harm.”\n\n“Adverse event reporting is NOT COMPULSORY, and this alone undermines any attempt to portray the injections as safe,” the group further explains.\n\n“CARM (New Zealand’s version of the U.S.-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) was never designed to early warn about experimental drugs rolled out to massive numbers.”\n\nPost-covid injection deaths are the elephant in the room that nobody wants to address\n\nPerhaps most concerning are the large numbers of young children who after getting shot are suffering cardiac injuries that used to only occur among the elderly – though many elderly people have mysteriously died post-jab as well.\n\nSeeing as how children have a zero percent risk of dying from covid, let alone getting sick from it in the first place, jabbing them is arguably the worst crime against humanity that has occurred in modern times.\n\n“We believe we are being lied to,” says NZDSOS. “We appeal AGAIN to the Police, headed by Andrew Coster, and our MPs (members of parliament), to intervene to protect the People.\n\nHalfway through the letter, a long list of cases is presented showing that post-injection injuries and deaths are anything but “rare.” They are disturbingly and obviously common when looking at the data, though few are brave enough to actually look.\n\nA summary of some 500 post-injection deaths is included in the letter, as recorded in the Citizen’s Database. A community group of volunteers with backgrounds in healthcare, information technology and science help to maintain it with the support of epidemiology and database professionals.\n\n“It has been built mainly from notifications by relatives, friends and health workers of people who have died following the covid-19 shots,” the letter explains.\n\n“Scientific accuracy forbids the use of the word ‘vaccine,’ since it does not prevent the disease nor its transmission. Some information has been gleaned from social media posts, newspaper reports and obituaries. Has anyone noticed how many there are? ‘Taken too soon,’ ‘sudden and unexpected’ adorn the pages.”\n\nBecause the so-called “authorities” refuse to even look into the situation at all is a huge red flag all on its own. If the jabs really are “safe and effective” as claimed, then there should be no problem looking through each case in order to debunk it as unrelated to the injections, right?\n\nThis is the elephant in the room that almost nobody in any position of power is willing to address, and NZDSOS is demanding once again that someone step up to the plate and take the matter seriously on behalf of public health.\n\n“Whatever the actual truth, NZDSOS and many others are certain that the true number of dead and injured people is very elevated, and not made clear to the public, who thus continue to sleepwalk into a treatment that is much more dangerous than the disease it purports to prevent, especially for the young,” the group says.\n\nThe latest news coverage about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” injuries and deaths can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNZDSOS.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA grants full approval to untested Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to Pfizer’s Comirnaty Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 years old.\n\nIn a press release, the FDA said the approval followed a “rigorous analysis and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data,” and that the vaccine “has been, and will continue to be, authorized for emergency use in this age group since May 2021.”\n\nHowever, the vaccine is not yet available in the U.S. for any age group as it is not the same formula as the Pfizer vaccine that has been authorized for use under the EUA and distributed as “fully approved.”\n\nMary Holland, the president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said the approval of Comirnaty for adolescents as young as 12 is “head-spinning.” (Related: Pfizer, FDA knew their COVID vaccine causes immunosuppression, ADE, VAED.)\n\n“The FDA failed to convene an expert committee and failed to appropriately weigh the risk-benefit profile of this vaccine for this age group,” Holland noted. “Even vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit acknowledged FDA decisions are being made based on political pressure, not science. When commenting on the agency’s vote last week to allow reformulated booster shots, he said it felt like ‘the fix was in.'”\n\nSome states will also likely attempt to put the vaccine on the childhood vaccine schedule despite unknown risks.\n\nComirnaty to receive liability protection when added to CDC’s immunization schedule\n\nWhile the Comirnaty vaccine can be mandated, it has no liability shield, which means that vials of the branded product that say Comirnaty on the label are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products. Only vaccines distributed under EUA have liability protection under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act (PREP).\n\nBut Comirnaty can receive liability protection when it is fully approved for children and added to the CDC’s immunization schedule, bringing it under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n\nHolland said Pfizer’s fraud and collusion with the government are becoming more evident: CHD is already challenging the EUA for children ages six months to 11, and will also be at the forefront of challenging this same authorization for adolescents and teens.\n\nFor its part, Pfizer said the approval is based on data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of 2,260 participants ages 12 through 15, and about half of the participants elicited neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) that demonstrate “strong immunogenicity in a subset of adolescents one month after the second dose.”\n\nIt is yet unknown what happens to antibody levels after one month, but peer-reviewed research suggests that protection after second and third doses of the vaccine wanes rapidly against the omicron variant.\n\nPfizer used an old analysis of 16 to 25-year-olds conducted before the delta and omicron surges, with an efficacy analysis conducted between November 2020 and May 2021.\n\nThe company admitted in its own press release that “only SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern identified from the confirmed COVID-19 cases in this age group was alpha.”\n\nMeanwhile, FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) said in its June 28 meeting that vaccine experts raised concerns that neutralizing antibodies did not correlate to clinical protection, noting that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine had a twofold increase in neutralizing antibody levels compared to that of Pfizer’s during the trials, but it still did not translate into a clinically significant difference in terms of protection against severe diseases.\n\nWatch the video below exposing how the vaccine advisory committee lied to get FDA approval for babies.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nPfizer tells federal judge that Pfizer owns the federal government and is thereby immune to normal contract law.\n\nNew York back in high risk category as “worst” omicron subvariant ravages the state.\n\nNearly 8,000 non-COVID excess deaths in UK traced to COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots.\n\nFather’s 20-year battle on behalf of vaccine-injured son exposes travesty of liability-free vaccines.\n\nFDA uses fraudulent data to justify pushing covid shots on infants and toddlers.\n\nSources include:\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org\n\nJAMANetwork.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "CDC now pushing FOURTH covid shot, with no end in sight… because “follow the science” means MINDLESSLY OBEY\n\nAshish Jha, the Biden regime’s Indian-American “covid czar,” held a video conference with Tony Fauci and Rochelle Walensky this week to announce that Americans should now line up for a fourth Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “booster” shot.\n\nBecause of the all-new Moronic Ninja variant of the Chinese virus, Jha, Fauci and Walensky want everyone in the United States to have at least four injections up their sleeve in order to keep them “safe.”\n\n“Many Americans are under-vaccinated, meaning they are not up to date on their Covid-19 vaccines,” Walensky bellowed, stumbling over her scripted portion of the presentation.\n\n“Not all people over the age of 50 have received their first booster dose. Of those who received their first booster dose, only 28 percent of those over 50 have received a second booster dose. And of those over the age of 65, only 34 percent have received their second booster dose.”\n\n“So, my message right now is very simple: It’s essential that these Americans, as Dr. Jha said, get their second booster shot right away.”\n\nFauci then chimed in about how Americans need to avoid thinking that the plandemic is over, even though it is clearly over – at least for the unvaccinated. Those who got jabbed, well, good luck with all those vaccine-induced AIDS (VAIDS) symptoms.\n\n“Everybody wants to put this pandemic behind us, and feel and hope that it doesn’t exist. It does!” Fauci yelled at the camera during his segment.\n\nWhy do they want people to suddenly get a fourth jab at warp speed?\n\nOne wonders, why the sudden push for an immediate fourth injection? What are Jha, Fauci and Walensky up to – or rather, what do they know that they are not disclosing?\n\nAre the triple-jabbed about to lose all immune function and thus require an extra boost to stay alive for a few more weeks? Or is the fourth booster the kill shot that they need to get into arms quickly for maximum impact?\n\n“The shots don’t prevent infection, and they don’t prevent transmission,” noted a commenter.\n\n“And, there is ZERO proof that the shots ‘lessen’ the effects of symptoms. Oh – and there sure are a lot of unexplained deaths these days.”\n\nAnother wrote that anyone who willingly takes this fourth shot is “guaranteeing themselves an early death.”\n\n“We are only one virulent strain away from massive deaths of the vaccinated with their compromised immune systems,” this person added. “Of course, the narrative will be that everyone must get vaxxed. There will still be those foolish enough to comply. They will get what they deserve.”\n\nLife insurance companies, meanwhile, are reporting massive increases in death claims among the 16-to-64 age demographic, which is also the most jabbed demographic.\n\n“And casket makers are selling over 5 times the annual number of child sized caskets as they normally do in the last 7 months,” added another commenter.\n\nOne would think that there would be widespread protests in the streets over the medical genocide that is taking place. Instead, hordes of angry women and their effeminate male allies are screaming about the loss of Roe v. Wade and the “right” to murder unborn children.\n\n“There isn’t a single vocal group of ticked-off, resistant Americans on the streets today protesting what is likely the worst medical atrocity in modern or any history,” a commenter wrote.\n\n“The worse the crime, the more it passes as normal in America today.”\n\nAnother pointed out that there are still many people out there, sadly, who will listen to Jha, Fauci and Walensky, no matter the evidence they are shown to the contrary.\n\nThe latest news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTwitter.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nCitizenFreePress.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Protesters plead with parents not to get their babies injected with COVID poison shots\n\nThousands of protesters consisting of doctors, nurses, scientists and other concerned citizens pleaded with parents not to have their babies injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine bioweapon.\n\n“The jabbing of babies has begun, but not without the protests of people standing outside these injection centers begging with parents to take one more day to stop and do the research before allowing their babies to be injected,” Dr. Jane Ruby said on her program “Dr. Jane Ruby Show.”\n\nShe addressed the parents sending their babies to get injected, telling them that they were making a life-altering decision for another human being who has no ability to understand and consent to the vaccination.\n\nRuby showed a video recorded during the protests of a man talking to a family alighting their vehicle parked near the vaccination site.\n\n“Please don’t come in. Don’t do it, guys. I’m begging you not to vaccinate your kids. It’s been two years. Please just do some research. These are precious babies. They don’t have the right, they don’t have a choice,” the man said to the mother carrying her toddler. The mother dismissed the man and told him: “Leave us alone.”\n\nThe man, who was part of the protesters, insisted that the vaccination cannot be reversed once its done. He even offered to pay the family to do the research, adding: “You could come back tomorrow after you did the research.” But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as the family entered the injection site.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Ruby said the scene was just too painful to watch. “[The mother] will be the first to write to me, sue me or whatever – and stand on the street and beg for something to get this out of her baby,” she remarked.\n\nLast month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for the mRNA vaccines to be injected into babies as young as six months old. However, the regulator admitted that it still authorized the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for the youngest population even though Pfizer’s clinical trial “was determined not to be reliable due to the low number of COVID-19 cases that occurred in the study participants.”\n\nBabies will not survive the clots, Ruby warns\n\nAs seen in previous episodes of Ruby’s program, she requested parents and families not to have the children vaccinated as they could not withstand the adverse effects, especially the possibility of growing clots that were recently discovered by embalmers.\n\n“Please don’t let babies and children get this. Do whatever you can do because babies are going to start dying horrific deaths. They’re not going to be able to survive this,” Ruby pleaded.\n\nDuring the show, she once again projected on the screen the freaky white fibrous clots of different sizes that were sent to her by an experienced anonymous embalmer.\n\nThe second embalmer came out after seeing “unnatural blood clots combinations with strange fibrous materials” clogging the arteries and veins of deceased individuals approximately six months after the COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out. The second embalmer’s revelations followed initial findings by embalmer Richard Hirschman, who saw similar clots in the bodies he was handling. (Related: Mike Adams full broadcast on the Alex Jones Show, June 13th, 2022, featuring an urgent care doctor, embalmer Richard Hirschman and Dr. Jane Ruby, plus live microscopy of biostructure “clots” that are killing people.)\n\nAccording to the second embalmer, he can now identify which cadavers have these clots due to having a somewhat bloated appearance. Ruby elaborated on this discovery: “It is kind of unusual that the rest of the body is not bloated. But when the [second] embalmer sees the neck vessels, there is more puffiness and distension that is not normally seen regularly.”\n\nThe second whistleblower even disclosed to Ruby that the white, fibrous clots were from a 90-year-old person who had a lot of innervations throughout their body. “You could just imagine that the person had been through tremendous pain,” she said.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more news about the dangers of injecting the COVID-19 vaccines on babies.\n\nWatch the full segment of “Dr. Jane Ruby Show” featuring protesters begging parents to reconsider their children’s vaccination below.\n\nThis video is from the Katy Odin channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nWATCH: Dr. Jane Ruby offers fresh insights about self-assembling “clots” and “nanowires” found in fully vaccinated cadavers.\n\nAnother embalmer exposes shocking post-vaccination fibrous CLOTS to Dr. Jane Ruby.\n\nGENOCIDE: FDA officially authorizes covid vaccines for children as young as 6 months.\n\nFDA uses fraudulent data to justify pushing covid shots on infants and toddlers.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nSteveKirsch.Substack.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system\n\nThe European Union (EU) has finally admitted that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines destroy the immune system and make people more susceptible not just to COVID but to all diseases.\n\nAccording to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), taking booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines every four months could weaken the immune system and tire people out. (Related: Qatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.)\n\nDespite this revelation, the EU is still recommending that people take COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. What the EMA wants to change is the time in between booster doses.\n\n“[Boosters] can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,” said Marco Cavaleri, the EMA’s head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy. “We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.”\n\nBut this revelation from the EMA has not stopped the EU from approving more vaccine doses for its population.\n\nThe EMA and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) approved the recommendation giving people between 60 and 79 years old second booster doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPeople with medical conditions that make them more susceptible to diseases are also now eligible to receive a second mRNA booster in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe approval of additional boosters for more vulnerable sectors of society was reportedly rushed following the recent rise in infections in perhaps the most vaccinated continent on the planet.\n\n“With cases and hospitalizations rising again as we enter the summer period, I urge everybody to get vaccinated and boosted as quickly as possible,” said European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides. “There is no time to lose.”\n\n“I call on member states to roll out second boosters for everyone over the age of 60 as well as all vulnerable persons immediately,” she added.\n\nECDC Director Andrea Ammon is also claiming that the continent is seeing “increasing COVID-19 case notification rates and an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries.”\n\n“This signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union,” said Ammon. “There are still too many individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible.”\n\nMore COVID-19 vaccinations will increase likelihood of death\n\n“The Daily Veracity” host Vincent James noted that even amending the time in between booster vaccinations likely won’t make any difference and people will still experience debilitating effects upon taking the vaccines.\n\n“If the vaccine and repeated doses of the vaccine destroys your immune system, which is what the European Union admitted recently, then this makes you more susceptible to all diseases,” warned James. “And if it makes you more susceptible to diseases, then it makes you more likely to die, because the vaccine destroys your immune system.”\n\nJames warned people against taking even just one COVID-19 vaccine, as evidence points to the fact that not only do they destroy the immune system, “but also they just straight up kill you.”\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Immunization.news.\n\nWatch this clip from “The Daily Veracity” as host Vincent James talks about the EU finally admitting that the COVID-19 vaccines destroy the immune system.\n\nThis video is from the Galactic Storm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nNew study confirms natural immunity provides longer, better protection against COVID-19 than vaccines.\n\nUK government data proves COVID-19 vaccines continue to damage immune system over time, creating vaccine-induced “AIDS.”\n\nSTUDY: 99% of people with previous COVID-19 infection develop natural immunity that lasts over a year.\n\nSTUDY: Natural immunity provides significantly better protection against COVID than vaccine immunity.\n\nVaccine expert: Giving COVID-19 vaccines to children is an unforgivable sin because they destroy children’s innate immune systems.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nBloomberg.com\n\nPrecisionVaccinations.com\n\nNYTimes.com\n\n\n\nFrance24.com\n\nSignup for our newsletter, we will respect your inbox and privacy\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Here is a story that the main stream, propaganda, corrupt media has chosen to ignore for over 17 years. We are counting on alternative media Truth Warriors to get this story out wide and far. This is the story of all time that can set us free from internet imprisonment and censorship. Use the article in full or in part. Create you own article from what we have provided you so that it resonates with your unique audience.\n\nCopy and post the videos to your own YouTube channel. Fan out the article to everyone in your social media network.\n\nMichael literally built the social media platform upon which we operate most of our digital systems. He designed it to be unlimited, scalable and fierce. He designed it for times like these when we “need all she’s got, Scotty.”\n\nLet’s show this amazing entrepreneur, who has been forgotten, robbed and marginalized by the swamp creatures of the cabal, what we can do in the alt media space to tell his story, using the very technology that was stolen from him and his shareholders, to be ONE BIG VOICE OF RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.\n\nMichael McKibben reminds us of another Scottish engineer – Scotty of Star Trek. The fictional character was in charge of the Enterprise engines, taking us “boldly where no man has gone before.” And now we have another Scotsman whose engine was built for travel in the digital realm, ready for this time and this space, to take us into higher realms of freedom and consciousness.\n\n.\n\nTrillion Dollar Rip-Off\n\nSocial Networking is a Stolen Trade Secret\n\nOne of the largest government sponsored industrial espionage thefts of copyrights, trade secrets, and patents in modern times was the theft of scalable social networking inventions. The technology and programming code that underlie Facebook, Gmail, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and most the other large-scale social networking companies runs on Leader Technologies’ intellectual property.\n\nIt was stolen by a group of criminal lawyers, judges, spies and bankers working with complete impunity and in total disregard for the law. Under the guise of the IBM Eclipse Foundation, James P. Chandler III (who was a national security advisor and top White House attorney) led the group of criminals who, interestingly enough, are also appearing in the news currently due to their most recently discovered crimes, along with John Podesta, Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, John Breyer, James Breyer, Larry Summers, Yuri Milner, Alisher Usmanov, Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and a host of others who are not so well known.\n\nUsually, we see them stealing oil, gold, uranium and other resources, but this time they stole the very software code that is utilized by the largest tech companies in America, Europe, Russia, China, South America, and anywhere else they could market it – making trillions of dollars in the process.\n\nThey carved up the globe and the markets in each region, giving each criminal a piece of the market using Leader Technologies’ stolen trade secrets. Eric Schmidt took America and Europe, Chandler got South America, Summers and his side-kick, Sheryl Sandberg, joined Schmidt in taking America. Yuri Milner, Alisher Usmanov and Summers got Russia; the Breyers got China, and a host of fake tech-lords became the front-men for all of the various social networks we see cropping up everywhere – the richest companies in the world – Google, Facebook, Amazon. The criminals got filthy rich off the back of a hard-working, creative American entrepreneur – Michael McKibben.\n\nWhat did Leader Technologies get? Seventeen years of lies, deceit, legal maneuvering, patent tricks, industrial espionage, betrayal, governmental manipulation, frauds on the courts, and a $10 million dollar legal bill – as well as seven lawsuits brought against Leader Technologies itself as an attempt to bankrupt them.\n\nListen to Michael McKibben, the founder and lead inventor of Leader Technologies and the person responsible for the biggest explosion of Internet technology in history, explain his story to citizen journalist and author, Douglas Gabriel.\n\n.\n\nThe Evil Tech-Cartel\n\nWeaponizing Social Media\n\nPatent theft is accomplished through the Patent Trial and Appeals Board and the many laws that allow the US Patent and Trademark Office to confiscate and control any patent deemed a national security issue. Once confiscated, the inventor is not compensated for the out-right theft of the patent. Stiff penalties, including incarceration, accompany these seemingly “illegal” patent laws that can steal any patent that the military (Department of Defense) or cyber-intelligence (all 17 agencies) considers a patent that could be turned into a weapon.\n\nOnce stolen, the government uses a complex group of public, and secret, defense agencies, corporate contractors, and crooked bankers to fund the weaponization of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other forms of intellectual property. Usually, the government builds in a “back-door” to the technology–so that they can control and manipulate the weaponized property. Then, they fund a “front-man” as a stooge to run a private corporation that is built on the weaponized invention.\n\nThe dummy company gets tens of millions of dollars in initial investments. Its underwriters then inflate valuations that turn into billions when the fake private corporation later hits the stock market. These fake front-men, pseudo-military corporations, stolen patents, and corrupt defense contractors then magically become the largest corporations in the world – Google (NSA), Facebook (NSA and CIA programs), Amazon (NSA and CIA) and on and on down the line of the huge tech corporations that are consuming everything around them in league with the ill-intent of the military and intelligence agencies.\n\nLeader Technologies’ inventions fueled dozens of the largest corporations in the world. It was out-right industrial espionage at the highest governmental levels that led to the theft of Leader’s trade secrets, copyrights, and patents.\n\nWhat is quite shocking is the list of exactly who is behind this blatant patent fraud, theft, and “legal” confiscation.\n\nOne man was principally responsible for not only conducting personal industrial espionage for his own gain, but also wrote patent laws, acts of Congress, and executive orders that are the framework for the “legal” theft of America’s inventions as well as the illegal surveillance of Americans.\n\nJames P. Chandler III was one of the key leaders of the tech-cartel that has grown into a completely corrupt system of theft, extortion, and fraud on a global scale.\n\nMichael McKibben has been in personal business dealings, and later, legal dealings with the core of this evil tech-cartel. He has fought them for 17 years and spent countless hours in depositions, courts, appeals and has even taken his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. He is still at the cutting edge of the continuing lawsuits against Facebook.\n\nNo one has seen the underbelly of the tech-lords real nature like Michael and his legion of ticked off shareholders. This battle again has arisen in the press due to another Supreme Court case that will be considered soon.\n\nThe battle rages on as American inventors continue to be out-maneuvered by the crooked system based on fake national security issues that are a front for crony corporate imperialism.\n\nStarting in about 1993, IBM met with this budding tech-cartel as they considered what to do about IBM wanting to sell computers to the C.I.A. and use them in foreign\n\ncountries. Podesta, Summers, Chandler, Clinton, Mueller, Rosenstein, and the other “governmental officials” told IBM to embed a back-door encryption key into all computer hardware, software and firmware sent outside of America. This happened after Congress refused to approve such a key.\n\nAs a result, the tech-cartel demonstrated their complete control of Congress over all technology produced by the military’s Defense Advanced Research Program (DARPA) and the CIA’s version called In-Q-Tel. Both DARPA and In-Q-Tel are directed in their research and policy by the Highlands Forum–a secret think-tank that has essentially created our modern technological world of war toys. In the process of investigating the legal corruption in their legal cases, Michael McKibben and his shareholders studied all of these groups and their inner workings quite thoroughly.\n\nLeader vs. Facebook\n\nZuckerberg’s Theft of Social Media\n\nMany people are aware that Mark Zuckerberg has had to settle out of court again and again over his theft of the social network that he called “Facebook”. What they don’t know, perhaps, is that Zuckerberg was one of the fake tech-lords who got his invention from James Chandler’s and Larry Summers’ efforts to apply the technology they stole from Leader and was being disseminated through the IBM Eclipse Foundation.\n\nZuckerberg is obviously a fake who admits that he “doesn’t write code anymore.” The supposed greatest “code writer” of our time isn’t interested in writing code now and appears to know little about the many hundreds of thousands of code lines used to create Facebook. Zuckerberg is obviously a front-man, and not a very good one.\n\nThe confused stories he tells about Facebook can be made sense of when they are told by the true inventor who did write the code for the greatest software advancement of our time. Listening to Michael McKibben explain the source code reveals, just in his words, that he is the true inventor.\n\nInternet Global Dominance\n\nMilitary Cyber Warfighting\n\nWhen Michael McKibben and his software engineers created their quantum leap in technology to almost infinite scalability with their social networking invention, they planned to implement a moral system that respected personal property and privacy and envisioned a new “age of freedom of information.” While Leader Technologies assumed that the government might want to use their invention, they had no way of knowing that the government intended to use it for the exact opposite moral purposes: to take away the user’s freedom and surveil everything in their lives.\n\nMichael was trying to advance the industry and certainly would have never believed that his own government might become his enemy as he resisted the whole-sale theft and weaponization of his inventions. How could Leader Technologies know that the most-respected patent attorney in America was also the most corrupt?\n\nWho could have predicted that the NSA, CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies would come to control the Internet, social networks, and every communication and broadcast in America – in contra-distinction to US laws and civil liberties. To witness the twisted uses of Leader’s original idea must have been maddening.\n\nWhat is a beautiful idea when implemented as originally designed, it would be a tool of higher human development.\n\nHowever, thanks to a thieving government, it was turned into a dark web of pornography, gambling, haters, and total military surveillance. The Internet that we once thought to be a harmless digital tool for greater communications became, in the end, the global network of control of industry, commerce, education, and our personal lives. Most American’s lives would change drastically without the social network scalability invented by Leader Technologies.\n\nLeader Technologies Cyberwar Solution\n\nUn-Weaponize the Internet\n\nLeader Technologies’ Michael McKibben has a solution to the problem of the US military and intelligence agency’s control of the cyber-warfare experiment called the Internet. The Department of Defense created the Internet which was originally called ARPANET, after the Department of Defense agency called DARPA. These groups have incubated and funded the principle components of the Internet, from the cables it runs on, to the routers every communication runs through, to the micro-processors inside every computer, to the software that makes it work.\n\nAll areas of our modern Internet-life were created for military purposes – not to create a system of world-wide free information as Leader Technologies first envisioned. The tech-lords’ monopolies can easily be turned off through one of two plans that the shareholders of Leader Technology have devised. Both plans end the control of the Internet by governmental military and intelligence agencies. Both plans are a win-win scenario for every American. Both plans help bring America back to a lawful society where the innovations and inventions of Americans are treated with respect and not usurped for military weaponization.\n\nThe social networking systems that have arisen from Leader’s inventions were meant to expand human freedoms, not suppress them. Only through a complete revamping of the system, and the removal of all government spying and control of information, can we end the drive to centralize all information access via Google, AT&T, Verizon, Amazon, Apple, Yahoo, etc., through communication via Gmail, Instagram, etc., and through social networking via Facebook, Snapchat, and many other companies.\n\nThe Internet must be freed from corruption, surveillance, and a contrived monopoly of information that rules our lives and imprisons information instead of freeing it.\n\nReal Russian Meddling in the Election\n\nFacebook’s Template to Win\n\nEric Schimdt and Mark Zuckerberg used Google and Facebook to manipulate users during the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. The Facebook “Template to Win” was written by a Russian. This program was used by Obama in the 2008 election to win and during the 2016 election, Obama set up a political war-room that utilized the Template to Win officially under the egis of the US Digital Service – a service used by Democrats against Republicans.\n\nSchmidt has been so bold as to brag about his billion dollar efforts to get Obama and Hillary into the White House by writing new algorithms that direct users to rigged sites and ads that support his candidates. Zuckerberg has tried to hide his crimes by lying about Russian ads and hiding his Template to Win, but the head of the Global Engagement Center has told the press that he used Facebook to target and attack US citizens throughout the election.\n\nZuckerberg now must answer to why Yuri Milner and other Russians own large amounts of Facebook shares. Mark also needs to answer why his best friend and investor ($200 million), the Russian Yuri Milner now lives in Silicon Valley and buys political and corporate support like it is popcorn. The tech-lord corruption is out of control and the US government is complicit.\n\nPresented by Tyla and Douglas Gabriel and Michael McKibben\n\nwww.americans4innovation.blogspot.com\n\n.\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE MEDIA\n\nPlease feel free to upload these videos to your own YouTube site and present them to your audience.

Under the headlines are links to articles that explain in detail.\n\n“In recent weeks there has been a radical movement to defend, dismantle and dissolve our police department,” Trump said at a Wednesday White House event, blaming the movement for “a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence.”\n\nParents, if you do not take control of your children’s education, their 2020-21 school year is going to look like a Marxist boot camp with testing, vacinations, and indoctrination. Just look what Detroit Public school students are having to go through:\n\n“Detroit Public School officials have five days, starting Wednesday, to test more than 630 summer school students for COVID-19 as a condition of keeping the program operating, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nDetroit Public Schools Community District attempted to fight the testing requirement, put in place by a Detroit U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow, but were able to expand the testing window from two to five days.\n\nTarnow held a Zoom hearing with attorneys and members of the media over a lawsuit seeking to shut down in-person summer school inside 23 Detroit Public School Community District buildings.” Source\n\nWith employment rates lower now as we transition through to our new American economy, parents have an opportunity to stay at home and educate their children and heal the family unit.

        "“Hot Weather.—Many a man has mopped his brow during the summer months of 1884, declaring it was the hottest weather the world ever knew, which, of course, would not be true, for the extreme heat in the record of the past has not been approached during the late summer. In 627, the heat was so great in France and Germany, says the London Standard, that all springs dried up; water became so scarce that many people died of thirst. In 879, work in the field had to be given up; agricultural laborers persisting in their work were struck down in a few minutes, so powerful was the sun. In 993, the sun’s rays were so fierce that vegetation burned up as under the action of fire. In 1000, rivers ran dry under the protracted heat, the fish were left dry in heaps and putrefied in a few hours. Men and animals venturing in the sun in the summer of 1022 fell down dying. In 1132, not only did the rivers dry up, but the ground cracked and became baked to the hardness of stone. The Rhine in Alsace nearly dried up. Italy was visited with terrific heat in 1189; vegetation and plants were burned up. During the battle of Bela, in 1200, there were more victims made by the sun than by weapons ; men fell down sunstruck in regular rows. The sun of 1277 was also severe; there was an absolute dearth of forage. In 1303 and 1304, the Rhine, Loire and Seine ran dry. In 1615, the heat throughout Europe became excessive. Scotland suffered particularly in 1625 ; men and beasts died in scores. Meat could be cooked by merely exposing it to the sun. Not a soul dared to venture out between noon and 4 p.m. In 1718, many shops had to be closed; the theatres were never opened for several months. Not a drop of water fell during six months. In 1753 the thermometer rose to one hundred and eighteen degrees. In 1779, the heat at Bologna was so great that a large number of people died. In July, 1793, the heat became intolerable. Vegetables were burned up and fruit dried upon the trees. The furniture and woodwork in dwelling-houses cracked and split up; meat became bad in an hour. In Paris in 1846, the thermometer marked one hundred and twenty-five degrees in the sun. The summers of 1859, 1860, 1869, 1870, 1874, etc., although excessively hot, were not attended by any disaster.”\n\nGaillard’s Medical Journal – Google Books\n\n“STATISTICS OF HOT SUMMERS.\n\nThe excessive heat which prevail. at present (says a Paris paper) gives some interest to the following account of remarkably bot summers :—” In 1132 the earth opened, and the rivers and spring; disappeared in Alsace. The Rhine was dried up. In 1152 the heat was to great that eggs were cooked in the sand. In 1160, at the battle of Bela, a great number of soldiers died from the heat. In 1276 and 1277, in France, there was an absolute failure of the crops of grass and oats. In 1303 and 1304, the Seine, the Loire, the Rhine, and the Danube, were passed over dry-footed. In 1393 and 1394, great numbers of animals fell dead, and the crops were scorched up. In 1440 the heat was excessive. In 1538, 1539, 1540, 1541, the rivers were almost entirely dried up. In 1556 there was a great drought over all Europe. In 1615 and 1616, the heat was overwhelming in France, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1646 there were fifty-eight consecutive days of excessive heat. In 1678 excessive heat. The same was the case in the first three years of the 18th century. In 1718 it did not rain once from the month of April to the month of October. The crops were burnt up ; the riven were dried up, and the theatres were closed by decree of the Lieutenant of Police. The thermometer marked 36 degrees Reaumur (113 of Fahrenheit). In gardens which were watered, fruit trees flowered twice. In 1723 and 1724, the heat was extreme. In 1746. summer very hot and very dry, which absolutely calcined the crops. During several months no rain fell. In 1748, 1754, 1760, 1767, 1778, and 1749, the heat was excessive. In 1811, the year of the celebrated comet, the summer was very warm and the wine delicious, men at Semmes. In 1818 the theatres contained closed for nearly a month, owing to the heat. The maximum heat was 35 degrees (110.75 Fahrenheit.) In 1830, whilst fighting was fining on on the 27th. 28th, and 29th July, the thermometer marked 36 degrees centigrade (97.75 Fahrenheit). In 1832, in the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of June, the thermometer marked 35 degrees centigrade. In 1695 the Seine was almost dried up. In 1850, in the month of June, on the second appearance of the cholera, the thermometer marked 34 degrees centigrade. The highest temperature which man can support for a certain time varies from 40 to 45 degrees (104 to 113 of Fahrenheit.)

During the battle of Bela, in 1260, more men died from heat than wounds. In 1303 and 1304 the Rhine, the Loire and Seine rivers ran dry. In 1779 many persons in Bologna were stifled. Shops all over Europe were closed for months. In 1821 a plague of mice came with intolerable heat. More than 200,000 persons died from beat in France.”\n\n21 Aug 1901, Page 3 – Shelby County Herald at Newspapers.com\n\nA RECORD OF HOT SUMMERS. IN 637 the heat was so great in France and Germany that all springs dried up, and water became so scarce that many people died of thirst. In 873 work in the field had to be given up ; agricultural labourers persisting in their work were struck down in a few minutes, so powerful was the sun. In 993 the sun’s rays were so fierce that vegetation burned up as under the action of fire. In 1000 rivers ran dry under the protracted heat ; the fish were left dry in heaps, and putrified in a few hours. The stench that ensued produced the plague. Men and animals venturing in the sun in the summer of 1022 fell down dying; the throat parched to a tinder and the blood rushed to the brain. In 1132 not only did the rivers dry up but the ground cracked on every side, and became baked to the hardness of stone. The Rhine in Alsace nearly dried up. Italy was visited with terrific heat in 1139; vegetations and plants were burned up. During the battle of Bela, in 1260, there were more victims made by the sun than by weapons; men fell down sunstruck in regular rows. In 1303 and 1304 the Rhine, Loire, and Seine ran dry. Scotland suffered particularly in 1625; men and beasts die in scores. The heat in several French departments during the summer of 1705 was equal to that in a glass furnace. Meat could be cooked by merely exposing it to the sun. Not a soul dared venture out between noon and 4 p.m. In 1718 the thermometer rose to 118 deg. In 1779 the heat at Bologna was so great that a great number of people was stifled. There was not sufficient air for the breath, and people had to take refuge under-ground. In July, 1793, the heat became intolerable. Vegetables were burned up, and fruit dried upon the trees. The furniture and woodwork in dwelling-houses cracked and split up; meat went bad in an hour. The rivers ran dry in several provinces during 1811; expedients had to be devised for the grinding of corn. In 1822 a protracted heat was accompanied by storms and earthquakes; during the drought legions of mice overran Lorraine and Alsace, committing incalculable damage. In 1832 the heat brought about cholera in France; 20,000 persons fell victims to the visitation in Paris alone. In 1846 the thermometer marked 125 deg. in the sun. 29 Nov 1888 – A RECORD OF HOT SUMMERS. – Trove\n\n50C (122F) in 1930\n\np2 – 30 Aug 1930 – The Telegraph (Brisbane, Qld. : 1872 – 1947) – Trove\n\n48C (118F) in 1773\n\nMorning Oregonian.

There were at least 40 killer tornadoes, including the only one to cause more than 100 deaths in two separate cities.\n\nApril 11, 1896\n\nDestructive thunderstorms swept across central Texas producing two killer tornadoes, both at night. A twelve-year-old boy died in one of five homes destroyed at the south edge of Colorado City in Mitchell County. At least one woman was killed in he rural home southwest of Cottonwood in Callahan County. There were other deaths across central Texas that may have been tornado related.\n\nApril 15, 1896\n\nAn early season F3 tornado wiped out a half dozen farms at 3 AM near Faulkton, South Dakota. Two children died in one farmhouse.\n\nApril 20, 1896\n\nIn Sandusky County, Ohio, a violent F4 tornado “crept along the ground like a mammoth rock, and smoke puffed at the top like an engine.” At least five homes were leveled to the ground at Booktown. Nineteenth century newspapers could always be counted on for unique and unusual descriptions of the tornado funnel.\n\nApril 24, 1896\n\nIn a brief touchdown at Salem, Roanoke County, Virginia, a tornado destroyed a bowling alley and a home. Three of the eight members of a family in one home were killed.\n\nApril 25, 1896\n\nA half-mile-wide, violent tornado cut a swath across Cloud, Clay and Washington Counties in Kansas. At least nine people, possibly eleven, died, all in Clay County as 27 farm homes were destroyed. Newspapers reported that “everything was leveled as if a roller had passed over it,” and the body of a dead child was reportedly carried for a half mile.\n\nMay 7, 1896\n\nPieces of a South Dakota farmhouse near Clark were carried for two miles. One woman was killed and ten other people were injured in the home.\n\nMay 15, 1896\n\nThis tragic day began with the death of an elderly man in his home at the hands of a 4 AM tornado in McPherson County, Kansas. The major activity was in the Red River area of Texas and Oklahoma. Three of the four members of one tornado family caused deaths and great destruction. The first damaged or destroyed 22 homes southwest of Denton, Texas, killing two people. Three more died north of Denton at the hands of the second member of the tornado family. The third member was among the most intensely devastating tornadoes in the nineteenth century. The funnel seemed to enter its shrinking stage as it turned to its left and cut across the west side of Sherman. At least fifty homes were destroyed, twenty of them completely obliterated. There were multiple deaths in seventeen families. A trunk lid with the owner’s name on it was carried for 35 miles. Many bodies were found a quarter mile from homesites cleaned of every stick of debris. The death toll was at least 73. A new thunderstorm spawned a tornado in Bryan County, killing four members of a family near Blue.\n\nMay 17, 1896\n\nThis unusual day produced killer tornadoes in Kentucky and Kansas, a rare combination. An early morning funnel described as “an enormous blue haze” obliterated a house near Elva, Kentucky, killing all five members of one family. At 5 PM, another of the nineteenth century’s most intensely violent tornadoes touched down near Palmer, Kansas, and lifted a hundred miles to the east northeast, near Falls City, Nebraska. Up to a mile wide, it devastated the Kansas towns of Seneca, Oneida, and Sabetha, leaving the farms in between “as bare as the prairie.” The tornado may have been almost two miles wide as it passed near Reserve, Kansas. The death total was 25.\n\nMay 24, 1896\n\nMoving to the east, this F4 tornado passed just north of DesMoines, Iowa at about 11 PM. Six, possibly seven, members of one family were killed at the north edge of Valeria. They were caught in the open, running to the storm cellar. Five others died in a nearby home. A steel railroad rail was reportedly driven 15 feet into the ground. The death toll was at least 21.\n\nMay 25, 1896\n\nThis week of almost continuous strong and violent tornado activity (perhaps the most violent single week of tornado activity in US history) continued with a 1 AM, F4 tornado in Ogle County, Illinois. A mother and three children died as a home was leveled south of Egan. A half hour later, three more died and six were injured in a home south of Davis Junction, Illinois. The late afternoon devastated parts of central and eastern Michigan. At 6 PM, in Tuscola County, Michigan, a home in which a funeral was taking place was destroyed. The thirty people in attendance ran safely to a ditch before the home was “lifted and dashed to the ground.” A man in a nearby home was killed by debris as he watched the events from his window. Two hours later, two people were killed as thirty homes were destroyed at Mount Clemons, Michigan. At 9 PM, the third F5 tornado of the year began leveling homes near Ortonville, Oakwood, and Thomas, Michigan. Nine people died in a single home at Ortonville. On the ground for thirty miles, the funnel killed at least forty-seven people.\n\nMay 27, 1896\n\nWhat may have been the first tornado of the day killed a woman near Bellflower, Missouri. At 3:15 PM, three students died and sixteen were injured in the destruction of the Dye School in Audrain County, Missouri. A few minutes later, the same tornado killed one student and injured nineteen at the Bean Creek School. At 6:15 PM, two children died on a farm in Osage County, Missouri. At about 6:30 PM, two tornadoes touched down almost simultaneously from separate storms. One leveled entire farms near New Minden, Hoyleton, Richview, and Irvington, Illinois. The other was the third deadliest tornado in US history, taking a total of at least 255 lives. In Saint Louis, Missouri, people died in homes, factories, saloons, hospitals, mills, railroad yards, and churches, as a half-mile-wide swath was cut across the center of the city. At least 137 people died at Saint Louis. Other people living on shanty boats may have perished in the Mississippi River, but were not counted because their bodies were washed downstream. At East Saint Louis, Illinois, the funnel had narrowed but may have also intensified. Devastation there was more complete, and 118 people were killed. Twenty seven more people died in other Illinois tornadoes this day.\n\nMay 28, 1896\n\nAt 1:30 PM a small tornado killed one person in a factory at Columbia, Pennsylvania. About an hour later, what may have been a single tornado killed two people in barns near Langhorne, Pennsylvania, then crossed the Delaware River and killed two more people in barns south of Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nJuly 8, 1896\n\nAfter a rather uneventful June, a hurricane crossed the Florida Panhandle and moved northward across eastern Tennessee and Kentucky. At Spring Hill, North Carolina, a woman was killed by flying debris in a tornado as she hung on to a tree.\n\nJuly 26, 1896\n\nOne woman died as a tornado destroyed a home in Marshall County, Iowa.\n\nJuly 29, 1896\n\nA store was destroyed by a tornado at Glouster, Athens County, Ohio. The owner died under the debris.\n\nOct 28, 1896\n\nA two day tornado outbreak began in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, where a man and child were killed north of Hartshorne. The nervous and still recovering town of Sherman, Texas, also had a close call with another tornado. One man was killed in a home just southeast of Sherman. In Lincoln County, Oklahoma, the postmaster and his wife were killed at Mitchell, east of Guthrie.\n\nOctober 29, 1896\n\nTornado activity resumed in the morning in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. Three people drowned as a tornado threw tenant homes into Lake Bruin. Later in the day, a watespout on the Mississippi River came ashore at New Orleans and swept two people into the river. Both drowned.\n\nNovember 25, 1896\n\nTwo homes were “blown to atoms'” near Mart, Texas. One person was killed.\n\nNovember 26, 1896\n\nThe last known killer tornado of the year took one life in a tenant home near Tunica, Mississippi at 10:40 PM."

        "You see, the vaccine’s spike protein is grown by genetically engineering baculoviruses to produce spike, and then infecting insect cells with the baculovirus to turn the whole thing into a spike protein factory.\n\nAt the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting that I live-blogged last week, it was revealed that the Novavax vaccine was being rolled out because it could be marketed as a “more traditional” vaccine, since it was not made from mRNA. Novavax was to be directed to the unvaccinated, although only 10% of the unvaccinated, it was anticipated, would accept it. The fact that no fetal cells were used in its development was claimed to be a marketing plus.\n\nBut NOTHING about this vaccine is traditional.\n\nFirst, the Novavax company does not own a manufacturing plant, so the vaccine being distributed in the US is made at the Serum Institute of India.\n\nSecond, the adjuvant, Matrix-M (a nonspecific, potent immune stimulant) has never been used before. It is made from the Quillaja saponaria tree. There is another adjuvant that is only used in one (highly reactogenic) US vaccine, Shingrix, which is an extract from this tree. This GSK adjuvant, named ASO1B, contains QS-21, a single extract in the Shingrix vaccine.\n\nThe problem is that we don’t know what extracts from the tree are included in Matrix-M. The information is proprietary! The Matrix-M adjuvant uses two unspecified “fractions” from the Q. saponaria tree, and there exist no data on its safety. (Matrix-M does not contain QS-21, although the company sometimes implies it does, to distract from its novelty.). These two fractions, combined with phospholipids and cholesterol, form the 40 nanometer particles of Matrix M.\n\nWhile the tree extracts are potent immune stimulants, all those characterized also have significant toxicity.\n\nThird, in addition to getting 5 mcg of spike protein in every dose, you will receive 1 mcg of residual amounts of baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins (≤ 0.96 mcg), and baculovirus and cellular [insect] DNA (≤ 0.00016 mcg), according to the FDA.\n\nSo, you are getting an additional 20% protein of insect and baculovirus origin in addition to the 5 mcg of spike protein. In each of your first two doses, at least 3 weeks apart.\n\nIn other words, the Novavax vaccine is not sufficiently purified. And no one can tell you how the insect and viral protein and DNA contaminants will affect you.\n\nAnyone who tells you that the Novavax vaccine is a traditional protein vaccine is a scoundrel. This vaccine is another “bait and switch” being rolled out solely to entice the unvaccinated, because it is not made of mRNA.\n\n* But it still gives you a big dose of the spike poison.\n\nThere is a single other vaccine in the US that uses the fall armyworm-baculovirus platform to produce viral proteins. It is one of about a dozen available flu shots, whose brand name is Flublok. It too contains worm and viral DNA and protein. See item 11 in its label.\n\nFourth, the regulators admit they have no idea if the vaccine works nor how dangerous it is. See below, which is a screenshot I took from the ACIP advisory committee meeting on Novavax.\n\nIt makes clear that the regulators don’t know how much myocarditis the Novavax causes, nor whether it works against current variants.\n\nRead More: Novavax Injections Includes Insect, Baculovirus Proteins Plus DNA"

        "Note: I’m republishing this piece, from 2020, so people don’t forget the criminal and the crime…\n\nNeil Ferguson, through his institute at London’s Imperial College, can call the shots on a major percentage of the global population.\n\nHe’s Mr. Genius, when it comes to projecting computer models of epidemics.\n\nFellow experts puff up his reputation.\n\nAccording to the Business Insider (4/25/2020), “Ferguson’s team warned Boris Johnson that the quest for ‘herd immunity’ [letting people live their lives out in the open in the UK] could cost 510,000 lives, prompting an abrupt U-turn [massive national lockdown in the UK]…His simulations have been influential in other countries as well, cited by authorities in the US, Germany, and France.”\n\nNot only cited, not only influential, but swallowed whole.\n\nBusiness insider continues: “On March 23, the UK scrapped ‘herd immunity’ in favor of a suppression strategy, and the country made preparations for weeks of lockdown. Ferguson’s study was responsible.”\n\nThere’s more. A lot more.\n\nSame BI article: “Dr Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator to the Trump administration, told journalists at a March 16 press briefing that the Imperial paper [Ferguson’s computer projection] prompted the CDC’s new advice to work from home and avoid gatherings of 10 or more.”\n\nFerguson, instigator of LOCKDOWN. Stripping away of basic liberties. Economic devastation.\n\nSo let’s look at Ferguson’s track record, spelled out in the BI piece:\n\n“Ferguson co-founded the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, based at Imperial, in 2008. It is the leading body advising national governments on pathogen outbreaks.”\n\n“It gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with ‘rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems’.”\n\nGetting the picture?\n\nGates money goes to Ferguson.\n\nFerguson predicts dire threat from COVID, necessitating lockdowns—thus preparing people to accept a vaccine. The vaccine Gates wants.\n\nFerguson supplies a frightening computer projection of COVID deaths—to the CDC and WHO. Ferguson thus communicates a rationale for the Gates vaccine plan.\n\nNational governments surrender to WHO and CDC. LOCKDOWNS.\n\nBusiness Insider: “Michael Thrusfield, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at Edinburgh University, told the paper he had ‘déjà vu’ after reading the [Ferguson] Imperial paper [on COVID], saying Ferguson was responsible for excessive animal culling during the 2001 Foot and Mouth [mad cow] outbreak.”\n\n“Ferguson warned the government that 150,000 people could die. Six million animals were slaughtered as a precaution, costing the country billions in farming revenue. In the end, 200 people died.”\n\n“Similarly, he [Ferguson] was accused of creating panic by overestimating the potential death toll during the 2005 Bird Flu outbreak. Ferguson estimated 200 million could die. The real number was in the low hundreds.” HELLO?\n\n“In 2009, one of Ferguson’s models predicted 65,000 people could die from the Swine Flu outbreak in the UK — the final figure was below 500.”\n\nSo you have to ask yourself, why would anyone believe what Ferguson has been predicting in this COVID hustle?\n\nAre his fellow experts that stupid?\n\nAre presidents and prime ministers that stupid?\n\nAnd the answer is: This is a monumental covert op; some people are that stupid; some are caught up in the op and are afraid to say the emperor has no clothes; some are aware of what is going on, and they want to destroy national economies and lead us into, yes, a new world order.\n\nGates knows he has his man: Ferguson. As the recipient of tens of millions of dollars a year from the Gates Foundation, Ferguson isn’t about to issue a model that states: COVID is nothing to worry about, let people live their lives and we’ll be all right. The chance of that happening is on a par with researchers admitting they never properly identified a new virus as the cause of illness in 2019, in Wuhan.\n\nIn order to justify injecting every man, woman, and child in the world with heavy metals, synthetic genes that alter genetic makeup, a host of germs, and who knows what else, Gates needs A STORY ABOUT A DEADLY VIRUS THAT NECESSITATES SHUTTING DOWN AND IMPRISONING THE PLANET, ACHIEVING A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE.\n\nHe’s got the story, all dressed up in a computer model, composed by a man with a past record of abject and devastating failures.\n\nNeil Ferguson is the ghost in the machine. The machine is the World Health Organization and the CDC. The man behind the ghost is Bill Gates."

        "A deadly virus that surged among young children after lockdown will be treated by preventive vaccines within five years, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group has said.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild, cold-like symptoms for most, but can be deadly for infants and the elderly.\n\nIn the UK, RSV is responsible for around 30,000 paediatric hospitalisations and 83 deaths every year, estimates suggest. Among adults, the figures are even higher with 175,000 GP appointments, 14,000 hospitalisations and 8,000 deaths.\n\nTypically spiking for six weeks in the winter, RSV puts significant strain on paediatric units. But for the last two years the virus has surged earlier in the year, in the summer months.\n\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said we are still in a “funny post-pandemic phase” when it comes to the spread of the virus.\n\nRead more: Reading the script: ‘Deadly virus surging in children will be defeated within five years’, vows Oxford vaccine chief.

        "In 1948, the US House of Representatives received a tip from a man named Whittaker Chambers that several federal officials had been working for the communists. One of these officials was more than happy to appear before Congress to clear his name—a leading State Department and United Nations representative named Alger Hiss.\n\nThe rakish Hiss was the exemplary American statesman: Polite, pedigreed, well-spoken, and a Harvard man to boot. During the 1945 United Nations conference, the Chinese delegation had proposed the creation of a new international health organization. After the Chinese failed to get a resolution passed, Hiss recommended establishing the organization by declaration, and the World Health Organization was born.\n\nIn Congress, Hiss coolly denied the allegations and denounced his deadbeat accuser for the libelous claims. The House came away newly reassured that the State Department was in excellent hands.\n\n(Spoiler alert: He was then and always had been a communist.)\n\nThe next year, intelligence leaks from the federal service led to the Soviet Union’s first successful nuclear test, ending the security afforded by America’s nuclear monopoly 15 years earlier than experts expected. Shortly thereafter, Kim Il-Sung and Chairman Mao used the cover of Soviet nuclear weapons to invade South Korea. The ensuing war claimed over 3 million lives and resulted in the permanent recognition of the nation of North Korea.\n\nAround this time, a little-known Congressman from California’s 12th district named Richard M. Nixon pressed Chambers for more information. Chambers reluctantly led Tricky Dick to a package of State Department materials he had hidden in a pumpkin patch—including notes in Hiss’s own writing. Alger Hiss became the most high-level American official ever convicted in connection with working for the communists.\n\n2022\n\nTo be honest, I barely knew who Matt Pottinger was until I read that he’d appointed Deborah Birx as White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in her bizarrely self-incriminating memoir Silent Invasion, which reads like it was written by the Chinese Communist Party itself. There’s little information about Pottinger’s role in Covid online.\n\nYet Pottinger is portrayed as a leading protagonist in three different pro-lockdown books on America’s response to Covid-19: The Plague Year by the New Yorker’s Lawrence Wright, Nightmare Scenario by the Washington Post’s Yasmeen Abutaleb, and Chaos Under Heaven by the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin. Pottinger’s singularly outsized role in pushing for alarm, shutdowns, mandates, and science from China in the early months of Covid is extremely well-documented.\n\nPottinger’s enormous influence during Covid is especially surprising not only because of his absence from online discussion about these events, but because of who he is.\n\nThe son of leading Department of Justice official Stanley Pottinger, Matt Pottinger graduated with a degree in Chinese studies in 1998 before going to work as a journalist in China for seven years, where he reported on topics including the original SARS. In 2005, Pottinger unexpectedly left journalism and obtained an age waiver to join the US Marine Corps.\n\nRead More: Pandemic Treachery: The Intelligence Agent Who Shut Down America"

        "First published by global research on December 27, 2020\n\nt is important to focus on the history of experimental vaccines.\n\nThis article reviews the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in Macon County, Alabama that began in 1932 as well as other US government experiments that infected sick and vulnerable people with syphilis and other deadly diseases applied in Guatemala between 1946 and 1948.\n\nIn Macon County, Alabama, the U.S. government monitored more than 600 black sharecroppers including 399 who were already infected with syphilis while the remaining 201 who were not.\n\nMany people of color in the U.S. do not trust the medical establishment because of this troubling history of human experimentations.\n\nAccording to CNN who was there to witness the historical moment of the first Covid-19 vaccine given to a black woman but in reality, it was propaganda for Big Pharma\n\n“A critical care nurse was the first person in New York and among the first people in the United States to get a shot of the coronavirus vaccine authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration.”\n\nThe US Government’s Human Experiments in Guatemala\n\nImage below: Female Patients at Psychiatric Hospital in Guatemala 1946-1948\n\nThe U.S. government under President Harry S. Truman, a Democrat from Missouri partnered with one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Guatemala, a U.S. puppet state with its President and lap dog, Juan José Arévalo and the rest of his criminal cohorts or shall we say his “health care officials” began experimenting directly with approximately 1,300 test subjects out of the 5,500 Guatemalans who were infected purposely without their informed consent. They were infected with syphilis, gonorrhea and a bacterial sexual infection called chancroid that comprised of soldiers, prisoners, prostitutes and patients who had mental issues. The experiments began in 1946 and ended around 1948. In a report by the Boston Globe, Susan M. Reverby, a medical historian and professor at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts discovered that “US government scientists in the 1940s deliberately infected hundreds of Guatemalans with syphilis and gonorrhea in experiments conducted without the subjects’ permission.” Reverby discovered the documents about “four or five years ago while researching the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study” and discussed her findings with the US government. The report said that “The US scientists — who had received the blessings of Guatemalan health authorities — were among the leading lights in the field of sexually transmitted disease research.” However, here is where the insanity was exposed:\n\nFlush with optimism in the dawning era of antibiotic treatment, they decided to expose vulnerable subjects to further their understanding of the effectiveness of the new drugs in treating sexually transmitted diseases\n\nThe discovery happened while Reverby, who was at the University of Pittsburgh some years before conducting research for her book ‘Examining Tuskegee’ which she focused on Dr. Thomas Parran Jr’s archives. Dr. Parran was a US surgeon general who was involved in studying methods in controlling the syphilis virus, but then Reverby discovered archives from another researcher who is deceased by the name of John C. Cutler who was a U.S. health service physician during the later years of Tuskegee syphilis study that began in 1932.\n\nCutler studied the effects and other different aspects such as the prevention and treatment of antibiotics called penicillin on individuals who were infected. In a BBC article from 2011,\n\n‘US scientists ‘knew Guatemala syphilis tests unethical’ said that “according to documents the commission had studied, at least 83 of the 5,500 subjects had died by the end of 1953.\n\nRead More – Big Pharma Propaganda and the COVID-19 Vaccine: The U.S. Government’s Legacy of Human Experimentations"

        "Did you know a person can have a heart attack and not even know it? In 2016, the American Heart Association’s journal, Circulation, reported that 45% of all heart attacks are what doctors call “silent”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop 10 SILENT heart attack symptoms you're likely to MISS\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMeaning they don’t cause the classic symptoms, such as pressure or pain in the chest or left arm.\n\nJust like a heart attack that causes sharp chest pain, a silent heart attack can occur when the arteries that carry blood to the heart become blocked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis deprives the heart muscle of nutrient-rich oxygen and can cause severe damage.\n\nIn today’s video, we look at the top 10 symptoms of a silent heart attack or silent myocardial infarction (SMI), that signal something isn’t right.\n\nMost times, the person having the heart attack doesn’t realize what’s actually going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis can then delay seeking medical treatment, and in the worst-case scenario, those precious moments can lead to a tragic outcome.\n\nContinue watching to find out which subtle signs are clues that someone you love might be suffering from a heart attack.\n\nNumber 10. Stomach pain and indigestion.\n\nMost commonly reported in women, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain are plausible warning signs indicating a heart attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is especially true if these gastrointestinal symptoms are accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.\n\nIn one study published in the journal Circulation, researchers interviewed 2,009 women who were hospitalized for a heart attack, and discovered that nearly 61.5 percent of them experienced nausea or stomach pain as a symptom of their event.\n\nIf you just had a spicy meal or a junk food feast, your upset stomach and heartburn are probably perfectly normal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when pain in your chest persists, and you aren’t sure it’s heartburn, it’s time to have your doctor run tests.\n\nEven experienced medical professionals can’t always tell a heart attack from heartburn.\n\nNumber 9. Lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\nNot drinking enough water, skipping lunch, or standing up too fast are all things that can make you dizzy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut feeling dizzy or lightheaded, accompanied by chest pain and shortness of breath, may signify that a heart attack could be on its way.\n\nWhen the heart struggles and cannot deliver oxygen, this adversely affects the brain.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are all heart attack signs that are more likely to occur in women than men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumber 8. Shortness of breath.\n\nIf you feel like you just ran a marathon after going up a flight of stairs, that may be a sign your heart is having difficulty pumping blood to the rest of your body.\n\nShortness of breath, for no apparent reason, can occur with or without chest pain, and is another overlooked sign of a silent heart attack.\n\nAccording to The Heart Foundation, this symptom occurs more often in men than women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumber 7. Nausea and vomiting.\n\nResearchers have provided several theories on the cause of vomiting associated with heart attacks.\n\nAccording to researchers, this happens when heart cells become damaged from poor blood supply.\n\nAs a result, these damaged areas then release lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and other metabolites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe buildup of these metabolites increases acidity in the blood, which can lead to vomiting.\n\nNumber 6. Pain in the throat and jaw.\n\nYou may have heard that chest pain that radiates down your arm is a heart attack symptom.\n\nWhat you might not know is that the pressure, tightness, pain, or squeezing or aching sensation in your chest and arms, can also spread into your neck, jaw, down your mid and lower back, and even your legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPain in your jaw and throat can feel like a bad toothache.\n\nThese body parts are often in the line of fire during a heart attack, because the vagus nerve is connected to not only the heart but also the abdomen, chest, neck, and brain.\n\nSo, when a blocked artery occurs, it can trigger the nerves in your heart to signal pain in order to warn you that something is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the vagus nerve spreads the signal to other areas of the body.\n\nNumber 5. Extreme fatigue or weakness.\n\nFeeling worn out after a sleepless night or a stressful day is normal. But if you’re sitting in bed, watching TV, and suddenly are no longer able to even hold your head up, this could mean trouble.\n\nThis is not an unusual situation. In one study, researchers found that over 45 percent of women who had a heart attack said they felt weak or tired right before they went to the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2003, the American Heart Association surveyed over 500 women who survived heart attacks and published the results in the journal Circulation.\n\nSeventy-one percent of women reported feeling tired for no logical reason in the weeks before their heart attack.\n\nIn the same survey, 48 percent of women said they experienced sleep disturbance up to a month before the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 31 percent of women experienced chest pain at the onset of their heart attack.\n\nAnd 43 percent reported no chest pain at all during their heart attack.\n\nNumber 4. Irregular heartbeat.\n\nAbnormal heartbeats, also known as arrhythmia, are a common heart disease symptom in both men and women, although it has other causes as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may notice that your heart is beating faster or irregularly, and in most cases, you will also experience dizziness.\n\nWhen your heart’s rhythm is disrupted, it isn’t pumping oxygenated blood properly, and this can lead to a heart attack.\n\nIf you have coronary artery disease, you may be at risk for a dangerous arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. This is a rapid, quivering heartbeat that can lead to heart palpitations, blood clots, heart attack and stroke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeek medical attention right away, if an irregular heartbeat is associated with other symptoms.\n\nNumber 3. Unexplained sweating.\n\nSweating excessively can happen minutes before a heart attack.\n\nAnd unlike regular sweat that happens after a workout or in warm weather, this symptom is often described as cold sweats.\n\nThis condition is called diaphoresis and affects your entire body rather than a part of your body.\n\nA 2005 study from the University of Illinois at Chicago found that perspiration, in combination with feeling discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, or jaw, could be a reliable predictor of a heart attack.\n\nNumber 2. A general feeling of unease.\n\nYou may not be feeling quite right, but cannot put your finger on exactly why.\n\nA general state of discomfort, and an overall feeling of unease, could indicate a silent heart attack is on the way.\n\nIt’s a good idea to get your heart checked out, even if you don’t think you’re exhibiting common signs of a heart attack.\n\nNumber 1. Pain in the chest.\n\nSome people do not experience any chest pain, while in others, the symptoms may not always be sudden or severe.\n\nChest pain or discomfort can last for several seconds or minutes and is just as common in men as it is in women.\n\nIn those with serious chest pain, some feel intense pressure or a sense of fullness. Others feel tingling or sharp stabbing pain.\n\nThere you have it! The top 10 subtle signs of a heart attack that are easy to miss. Being aware of these symptoms could save your life—or someone else’s.\n\nOne thing you can do to prepare is to have medically prescribed aspirin or nitroglycerin in your home.\n\nAlthough a heart attack is life-threatening, these medications can help stabilize the condition while waiting for help to arrive.\n\nTo learn how you can erase artery plaque and lower blood pressure, click the link in the description.\n\nAs always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, Like, Share, and Subscribe, and click on the bell icon, so you never miss a video!\n\nAnd now, over to you: Have you ever experienced a heart attack?

        "You probably don’t think about your liver every day, but it is hard at work filtering blood, removing waste and producing bile – among other essential functions. When your liver becomes sick or injured, it can affect other parts of your body and throw your health into jeopardy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are 5 liver problems symptoms your legs REVEAL\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nIn today’s video, we’ll go over 5 ways your feet can tip you off to a problem with your liver, and when it’s time to call the doctor. So, if you’re ready, let’s get into it!\n\nNumber 5. Swelling.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is a medical term used to describe the late stage scarring of the liver. This chronic condition can be caused by injury, disease, alcohol abuse, and prescription drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, liver cirrhosis doesn’t always show symptoms. One lesser known warning sign of liver cirrhosis is swelling in the legs, feet, or ankles.\n\nThis happens because increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to buildup in the legs and abdomen. The portal vein is the major vessel that drains the blood from the gut, gall bladder, pancreas, and spleen to the liver.\n\nIndividuals with liver cirrhosis may also suffer from fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, and bleeding, or bruising. Some additional warning signs may include developing spider-like veins on the skin, redness on the palms of the hands, itchy skin, and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther than cirrhosis, a buildup of fluid in your legs, ankles, or feet, could also be a symptom of one of several related liver conditions: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, fatty liver disease, or even liver cancer, according to experts at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nNumber 4. Muscle Cramps.\n\nWhen it comes to common signs of liver cirrhosis, muscle cramps are typically NOT one of them. However, a 2014 study published in The American Journal of Medicine, found that 67 percent of participants with cirrhosis, experienced muscle cramps three months prior to the study.\n\nAccording to the researchers, muscle cramps were associated with significantly decreased quality of life in patients diagnosed with cirrhosis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is still unclear why cirrhosis patients in the study suffered from muscle cramps. Researchers suggest that a neurologic, muscular, endocrine, or electrolyte imbalance could be a plausible cause.\n\nNumber 3. Joint Pain.\n\nJoint pain in your legs or any other parts of your body can be caused by a variety of different reasons. Sometimes, it can be caused by viral hepatitis, a type of liver inflammation that can occur as acute infections, or as a chronic condition.\n\nIf your joint pain is due to viral hepatitis, you’ll notice other symptoms including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, jaundiced skin, dark urine, and general weakness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoint pain can come both from the illness that leads to cirrhosis, or cirrhosis can make the pain from existing conditions worse. For example, if you have fatty liver disease and are obese, you may also have osteoarthritis, says the Cleveland Clinic. And cirrhosis makes your bone and joint pain worse. Cirrhosis also causes inflammation in your entire body, which can lead to general pain.\n\nNumber 2. Spots on your Legs or Arms.\n\nAccording to a report published in 2009 in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, changes in the skin are often the first clue that a person may have liver problems. And being able to recognize these signs is crucial to diagnosing liver conditions early.\n\nOne such skin symptom is Bier spots, which are characterized by irregularly shaped or mottled white spots that can develop on the legs, arms or hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost cases of Bier spots are benign and have no cause for concern. However, it is still a good idea to consult your doctor if you notice them, especially if you experience any other common liver symptoms.\n\nNumber 1. Tingling or numbness.\n\nPeople with liver problems may experience tingling or numbness in their feet. This can be because of a hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, or diabetes. Diabetes is more common in people with liver problems because the liver regulates glucose levels. Any of these conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy, which damages the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nThere you have it, the five ways your legs and feet can signal liver problems. Seek medical treatment if any of these symptoms do not go away after a few days of at-home treatment\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo support your liver, so that it doesn’t have to work as hard during the detox process, avoid inflammatory foods, and replace with anti-inflammatory foods in your diet.

        "When you eat too much salt, your body will send you warning signals to remind you it is time to control your salt intake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Dry mouth\n\nWhen you eat too much salt, the most direct feeling is a dry mouth, because the electrolyte balance of salt and water in the body is broken. In order to adjust this balance back to normal, the brain will send out thirst signals, so you have a strong desire to drink water.\n\n2. Slowed reaction\n\nEating too much salt can lead to cell dehydration. When a person is dehydrated, the brain is affected, thus slowing your reaction and reducing focus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Thicker fingers\n\nIf you are not gaining weight, but your fingers feel thicker, it is possible that you are eating too much salt. This can cause water retention and edema.\n\n4. Headache\n\nEating too much salt can raise blood pressure and blood vessel pressure. This can cause cerebral edema, which is when the nerves are squeezed and results in a headache.\n\n5. Urge to urinate\n\nIf you eat too much salt, your kidneys have to work harder to get rid of the extra sodium. This makes you want to go to the bathroom more often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch out for these symptoms. If you eat too much salt, it is important to control your salt intake in order to avoid health problems.\n\nNext, what exactly are the dangers of eating too much salt?\n\nFirst, let’s be clear: excessive intake of salt (sodium chloride) may indeed pose certain threats to your health.\n\n1. Increase the pressure on the kidneys\n\nSodium is mainly excreted by the kidneys after it enters the body. If you eat too much sodium, it can make the kidneys work harder. This can cause sodium and water retention, which makes the kidneys work even harder. Over time, this can make the kidneys overwhelmed and sick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Blood pressure is likely to rise\n\nIf you eat too much salt, it may lead to high blood pressure. When you eat too much sodium, the number of sodium ions in your blood goes up. This makes the blood vessels more resistant to blood flow, which can cause water retention and an increase in blood pressure.\n\n3. Accelerate calcium loss\n\nIf you eat too much salt over a long period of time, your body will get rid of sodium and calcium at the same time. This can lead to excessive calcium loss over time.\n\nIf not replenished in time, the sodium will stimulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone, disrupting the balance of bone metabolism, which can ultimately enhance the risk of osteoporosis in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, controlling salt intake is still important for your health. But note: low salt does not mean your food will taste terrible. You can reduce the amount of salt you use in cooking by 5-10%, and it won’t affect the taste but will be good for your health."

        "Emails show NIH funded gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses\n\nEmails dated as far back as May 2016 show that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) knew about illegal gain-of-function research taking place on bat coronaviruses in communist China but continued to funnel money there via Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nA trove of documents obtained by Judicial Watch revealed a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) “inquiry” into the NIH and its controversial bat coronavirus grant to EcoHealth, which is also tied to the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is believed to have originated.\n\n“We received a warning that one of the publications [redacted] listed from the past year is non-compliant,” wrote EcoHealth’s chief of staff Alexa Chmura in an email to NIH official Carine Normil. Chmura was reportedly referencing EcoHealth’s direct funding of bat coronavirus gain-of-function research at the WIV.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), gain-of-function research aims to make viruses more dangerous or transmissible in order to “enable assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents.”\n\nErik Stemmy of the Tony Fauci-headed National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) also wrote to Normil about the issue, stating that the agency had “proposed work for the next year of the award that may be subject to the gain-of-function funding pause.”\n\n“Dishonest” Fauci directly involved in scandal, says Judicial Watch\n\nJudicial Watch obtained some 1,650 pages of records from the NIH revealing that an FBI “inquiry” into the matter had been opened. This inquiry, the group said, shows that Fauci and “others” are directly involved in the scandal.\n\nJudicial Watch further said that Fauci and his friends and colleagues were also “being dishonest in dismissing the seriousness of questions about their cover-up of their funding of dangerous gain-of-function research in China.”\n\nWe already knew from a previous document drop in 2021 that the NIH had, in fact, funded illegal gain-of-function research at the WIV between the years of 2014 and 2019 – and possibly even further back than that.\n\nThat 900-page trove, which was obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, includes other email exchanges, including one written by Stemmy and NIH official Jenny Greer to Chmura.\n\n“[This work] may include gain-of-function research that is subject to the U.S. government funding pause issued on October 17, 2014,” read the email dated May 2016.\n\nAnother one written by Stemmy to Grant Operations on June 15, 2016, advised that EcoHealth’s research might be considered gain-of-function.\n\n“The Daszak award may have GoF [gain-of-function] and I’ve been in touch with the GMS [Grants Management Specialist] for a while now,” Stemmy wrote.\n\nOther emails showed that Daszak failed to report on time to the NIH about a grant his organization received. This prompted Normil to write Daszak in May 2016 the following message via email: “This is the second communication from NIAID requesting that you file the progress report for the above-referenced grant [5R01AI110964] that was due no later than April 15, 2016.”\n\n“Please submit the delinquent report by May 12, 2016. Please be advised that continued late submission of your non-competing grant progress report and any subsequently requested documentation will result in a reduction of time and/or funds for this grant.”\n\nMind you, all of this exposes Fauci as a liar, seeing as how he denied under oath that the NIH or NIAID were in any way involved with “gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” to quote his defensive words to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus and its many scandals can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "7 BIGGEST mass media cover-ups since the COVID-19 scamdemic began\n\nWithout fake news “mainstream media,” the medical industrial complex would not be nearly as effective at conning and coercing so much of the populace into this toxic pharma scamdemic that has been not only a cash cow for the pharma goons, but a death sentence for millions of sheeple. MSM is the “right arm” of the pharma industrial complex, just as IG Farben (pharmaceutical conglomerate) was for Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe television, newspapers, social media, and shill websites all get their narrative script directly from the CDC, and it’s all propaganda to push faulty PCR tests, masks, prescription drugs, ventilators, paranoia, and of course, blood clotting “vaccines.”\n\nMass media is the propaganda arm of Big Pharma, for a fake history of medicine and to cover up current events that defy the narrative\n\nAs toxic medicine and deadly vaccines maim and kill millions of Americans, the only way to keep the scamdemic “alive” and spreading is to use the pharma arm of fake news, to cover up the carnage as it occurs, and as it is revealed by truth news (independent media). An entire fake history of medicine has been propagated for the sheeple to digest (and regurgitate), leaving the masses with no clue that their own government wants them dying and dead, while robbing them of all their rights, health, and livelihood in the process.\n\nWelcome to VIRUS MANIA of 2022 and beyond, where the mass media covers up anything and everything that would reveal the FDA, CDC, and WHO are in cahoots to turn every American into a zombie who takes toxic medicine daily, clot shots for “virus” scams, and eats genetically mutated, lab-concocted food all day. All of this while those same zombies read fake news and repeat that narrative like it’s fact, for all their friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers.\n\nHere are the 7 most epic mass media cover-ups since the Wuhan lab virus plandemic began\n\n#1. The “vaccines” are not really vaccines, so the CDC had to change the definition\n\n#2. Most of the people dying from Fauci Flu are “fully vaccinated” against it\n\n#3. mRNA DOES change your DNA, tricking cells into producing unlimited toxic prions\n\n#4. Masks do NOT work, but rather breed bacteria in the mouth, throat, and lungs\n\n#5. PCR tests are mostly false positives used to spread virus mania and increase pharma profits\n\n#6. Healthy athletes, pilots, celebrities, and military members are suffering myocarditis and deaths from the clot shots and the media NEVER mentions vaccine-induced injuries\n\n#7. Spike proteins travel throughout the ENTIRE vascular system, invading organs and clogging vessels, not just remaining at the “site of injection”\n\nSick news for sick people under a sick regime\n\nYes, the CDC had to change the “definition” of vaccines, because the Fauci Flu clot shots don’t even fit it, and they definitely wanted to be sure they could call them “vaccines,” since three out of every four Americans think vaccines are good for your immune system and “save” you from infectious disease death. Most of the world that’s catching and/or dying from COVID-19 are triple-vaxxed and still getting more clot shots as they become available as “boosters.”\n\nThese gene therapy “victims” think the spike proteins help them avoid COVID-19, and they have no clue that these toxic, virus-mimicking, sticky prions clog the entire vascular system, and invade vital organs, shutting them down. Got severe, chronic inflammation? Look no further than the clot shots.\n\nMeanwhile, fake news and fraudulent Fauci have the masses thinking their bacteria-breeding masks are keeping them safe from viral particles that are flying around looking for maskless, unvaccinated people and taking them out like flies. Yet, those same masks help provide false-positive PCR tests, that add to the chaos and paranoia of the scamdemic, leading the masses to their death caves (MD offices and hospitals).\n\nDo your own research and don’t use Google.

        "COVID QR codes now being used to RATION FUEL in Sri Lanka as economic collapse accelerates\n\nWe are hearing through the grapevine that Sri Lanka’s latest approach to handling the fuel crisis in its country is to ration fuel using residents’ Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) QR codes.\n\nThe only way to buy gasoline in Sri Lanka, we are told, is to show one’s COVID “passport” via a smartphone – this being exactly the type of government misuse that many warned about when QR codes for the plandemic were first introduced.\n\nA type of the Mark of the Beast, COVID QR codes are a digital mark that must be shown in order to continue engaging in commerce, as fuel is needed to drive, as well as to create and transport goods and services.\n\nRussia’s “special operation” in Ukraine is shouldering most of the blame for Sri Lanka’s current dire situation as the tiny country, located at the southern tip of India, struggles to maintain adequate gas supplies amid a global rush for gas.\n\nPrices for what little gas Sri Lanka has been able to procure are skyrocketing, and the government’s solution is to demand that residents show their COVID QR codes in order to partake (Related: Check out our earlier coverage about the Sri Lanka fuel protests to learn more about the spiraling situation in the Southeast Asian country).\n\nIs fuel rationing on the agenda for the rest of the world?\n\nIt sounds as though the COVID QR code in Sri Lanka has been retooled as a gas rationing QR code, meaning residents are awarded access to fuel on some kind of rolling basis depending on available supplies.\n\nAs some gas becomes available, in other words, certain residents are notified that they can show up to purchase gas – just so long as their code has been “activated.” Those without an active QR code will not be allowed to purchase any gas.\n\nThe below video, which was shared on Twitter, shows the process in action:\n\nSri Lanka ?? Fuel Rations delivered and authorized by a Govt QR Code…Coming to a town near you, unless of course you ??????? pic.twitter.com/TVA6aOf80P — ????????????? (@risemelbourne) July 21, 2022\n\nSeeing as how covid QR codes were used in many other countries besides Sri Lanka, and seeing as how fuel shortages and inflation are now afflicting pretty much every country except Russia and its allies, it is safe to assume that this new imposition will spread to other countries.\n\nAs the gas taps get shut off in Europe, for instance, there is a chance that Europeans in countries like Germany and The Netherlands could eventually be told that they, too, need to show their QR codes in order to heat their homes and businesses this winter.\n\n“They’ll tighten the screws to do everything they can to get ppl onto the App,” tweeted someone named “GetBackToLife – #NoJabsForKids” (@TinyFighterGirl).\n\nSomeone else named “Luther” (@LutherBurgsvik) tweeted a link to FuelPass.gov.lk, though it does not seem to be accessible from anywhere outside of Sri Lanka – except, perhaps, with a VPN (virtual private network) ¬– as the main page displays a message stating:\n\n“National Fuel Pass: You are not authorized”\n\n“No doubt, this is where civil war comes into play,” added the GetBackToLife Twitter account in a separate tweet.\n\nAnother named “Rozalyn Gracia” (@graccie_roz) tweeted that she believes Sri Lanka was “intentionally staged to make way for this” as an example for the rest of the world to emulate as the economic dominoes continue to topple.\n\n“This is exactly the essence of Agenda 2030,” she added. “God help us if people don’t wake up in time.”\n\nThe latest news about the engineered takedown of the world economy by globalists can be found at Rationing.news\n\nSources include:\n\nTwitter.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "VIRUS MANIA PART II: Anthony Fauci is just the latest in a long line of virus hucksters and con artists going way back in history\n\nIt is true that Anthony “Fraudulent” Fauci is at the epicenter of the SARS-Coronavirus scamdemic that has cost millions of lives around the globe while padding the pockets of Big Pharma gurus around the planet, including himself. Fauci was instrumental in funding the research for “gain of function,” that enabled a strictly animal virus to spread to humans.\n\nYet, that was just the fulcrum of the real pandemic that would follow – that of mass vaccination, where injecting or creating (mRNA) billions of spike protein prions leads to vascular damage for the “gene-therapy-treated” humans who bought into the COVID-19 scamdemic, that was based and propagated on fear-mongering that spread like wildfire. This “pandemic” is just like every other infectious disease scare we’ve encountered over the past three centuries. Anthony “Fraudulent” Fauci is just the most recent huckster and con artist to reach the front of the line in a long line of charlatans and pharma shills.\n\n“The primary purpose of commercially-funded clinical research is to maximize financial return on investment, not health”\n\nThe richest and most powerful people on Planet Earth function mainly in one or more of three industries: oil, tech/media, and pharma. This is no secret, but the way they get rich in the pharma realm is covered up, because what the majority of Americans believe are medicine and vaccines are in reality WEAPONIZED treatments that make you sick, sicker and/or dead. Patients who follow the general advice of medical doctors (including pediatricians), oncologists and surgeons often find themselves in deep water, with no ‘life raft’ in sight. Their health deteriorates quickly while the doctors point at incurable, ‘genetic’ issues, only treating the compounding, horrifying symptoms of the very ‘medicine’ that’s been prescribed, including all vaccinations.\n\n“The primary purpose of commercially-funded clinical research is to maximize financial return on investment, not health.” That quote comes from the foreword of an amazing, whistle-blowing book titled, Virus Mania: How Big Pharma, Media Invent Epidemics. This corrupt model of Western medicine is an epidemic based on fear, not viruses or bacteria.\n\nBack in the 1800s, when “germ theory” was first propagandized to scare the masses, fear campaigns began to take root in America, and they were already enough to propel chemical medicine to the forefront – weaponizing an insidious cash cow this country had never experienced before. This is how “epidemics” and “pandemics” are invented.\n\nMeasles fear-mongering began in the 1700s and continues today\n\nBack in the 1600s, measles first appeared and was documented in Boston. By the 1700s, scientists who were able to reveal the infectious nature of measles also instigated the propaganda machine that would turn a minor amount of measles deaths into a bloated, inflated statistic to scare the world to death (pun intended). Government health officials would later claim that for every 1000 kids who got the measles, one or two would die. That was a lie. The CDC and mainstream media still push this fabricated falsity today.\n\nThe truth is that the odds of dying from measles are equivalent to drowning in a swimming pool, or tripping down a flight of stairs. The mortality rate of measles plummeted long before the measles “vaccine” was supposedly discovered in 1962 by Maurice Hilleman, a Merck pharma shill.\n\nThe measles vaccine, in other words, is the “pandemic” that causes detrimental, chronic health problems that drive mass profits for the pharma machine. The vaccine is what to worry about, much more so than the measles virus itself. Far from ever being “safe and effective,” the measles live virus vaccine, made by Merck, is given to 1-year-olds and 4-year-olds as a two-part series to make sure those children stay infected and sick throughout their childhood, developmental years. How?\n\nThose injections contain gelatin, sorbitol, bovine cow serum and human albumin (infected blood cells from human abortions). Gelatin is derived from the collagen inside animal skin and bones, and when injected poses risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease). Sorbitol is a synthetic smoothing agent that metabolizes very slowly, aggravating the digestive tract and causing acute gastrointestinal issues. Doctors make a fortune treating children because of this alone.\n\nBovine cow serum is extracted from cow skin, and, when injected, causes connective tissue disorders, lupus, arthritis, shortness of breath (recognize that one?), low blood pressure, chest pain and other serious skin reactions. Can you say pharma cash cow?\n\nHuman albumin is also purposely concocted in the measles jabs. This is the protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma, and when injected causes fever, chills, rash, hives, severe headaches, nausea, breathing difficulty and rapid heart rate. Injected human albumin into humans can also result in a loss of body cell mass and lead to immunodeficiency virus infection. That human albumin might also contain SV40, AIDS, cancer and/or Hepatitis B from drug addicts.\n\nMaurice Hilleman did NOT discover a “vaccine” for measles, but rather a weaponized jab for infecting children, teens and adults en masse\n\nMaurice Hilleman did NOT discover a “vaccine” for measles, but rather openly admitted on tape that these vaccines given to Americans are contaminated with leukemia and cancer viruses. He was literally caught laughing about it. He said because they first tested this dangerous jab in Russia, that the Russian athletes competing in the Olympics would easily lose because they would all be “loaded down with tumors.”\n\nThe measles vaccine actually spreads an attenuated version of the measles in order to effectively spread the pandemic propaganda. That’s how these pharma hucksters all function, through the spread of fear using rather harmless versions of viruses. Then the vaccines inflict the chronic damage (think MMR here) that rakes in the profits for the pharma industrial complex, also known in the USA as chronic sick care. This is why “epidemics” and “pandemics” are invented.\n\nThat’s why Fauci is just the newest huckster in the long line of pharma shills and charlatans that push toxic “vaccines” as the medicine for the very fear-based pandemics they create, manipulate, push so heavily using the mass media complex and the CDC for the scripted narrative. Check out the book Virus Mania for an in-depth look at the propaganda machine behind every epidemic and pandemic we’ve ever known.\n\nBookmark Censored.news to your favorite websites for truth news that’s being censored from the rest of media as you read this.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nPowells.com\n\nTruthWiki.org\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nTruthwiki.org\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Dr. Jane Ruby: Two new stunning discoveries found in blood clots from the COVID vaccinated – Brighteon.TV\n\nPhysician and author Dr. Jane Ruby shared more bombshell findings from board-certified embalmer Richard Hirschman during the July 18 episode of “Live with Dr. Jane Ruby” on Brighteon.TV.\n\nThe veteran medical professional said there are two new stunning discoveries related to the white fibrous clots Hirschman found in the dead bodies of vaccinated individuals. (Related: Dr. Jane Ruby: Unnatural blood clots found in dead bodies of vaccinated – Brighteon.TV.)\n\nRuby also said Hirschman was able to verify that majority of the deceased people were jabbed with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.\n\nThe white fibrous clots were pulled out of all the major arteries and veins in the thigh, groin, arms and neck.\n\nWhite fibrous clot with chunky ball sacs and micro clotting\n\nRuby, also a pharmaceutical drug development expert, showed the audience one of Hirschman’s latest discoveries – a white fibrous clot with chunky ball sacs. She pointed out that they may have grown intermittently and are almost like outgrowths of the original white fibrous clot.\n\nHirschman said the chunky ball sacs, which were all from vaccinated individuals, reminded him of spider eggs covered by spider web.\n\n“And you can see that white fibrous stuff kind of marbling into that little ball, which kind of looks like a small grape. But the thing is, even in the beginning a lot of times I noticed that one end or the other would be some blood attached to the white fibers clot that I’m having. And then other times it’s kind of running along the white fiber material as well,” Hirschman said.\n\nRuby mentioned that a 1,500 times magnification of the blood clots have shown things that are part of the self-assembling nanoparticles. She noted that Brighteon.TV founder Mike Adams said initial analysis showed the white clots are not organic material, protein, amyloid, fibrin or cholesterol. Hirschman also confirmed that the strange white stuff in the blood clots is not normal.\n\nThe board-certified embalmer also talked about micro clotting, saying that the black specks that can be seen in the picture and video shown by Ruby are examples of micro clots. He also shared that a radiologist from Michigan told him that the micro clots are very concerning because they can flow through the body and block out vessels and slowly starve the organs from getting the nutrients that they need.\n\nHirschman said micro clots are almost like real fine sand, beach sand or powder substance that is in the blood and these are slowly causing other ailments and other diseases that are not being diagnosed.\n\nAccording to Ruby, this is another situation where chemical analysis is needed. She noted that these micro clots could be some kind of graphene or some other material that is self-assembling and forcing the body to make.\n\nHaving millions or billions of these micro clots circulating in a person’s brain, heart or lungs are very dangerous, she said. Hirschman agreed, adding that these micro clots could be bumping into each other and forming larger ones.\n\nFollow VaccineHolocaust.org to know more about the fibrous blood clots found in dead bodies of the vaccinated.\n\nWatch the July 18 episode of “Live with Dr. Jane Ruby” below.

        "Virology Journal paper confirms covid jabs deplete immune function over time\n\nA cardiovascular surgeon at Okamura Memorial Hospital’s Center for Varicose Veins (Japan) authored a study published in the Virology Journal that reiterates the fact that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” are an immune destroyer.\n\nKenji Yamamoto, commenting on another recent study published in the journal The Lancet, says that eight months after receiving two doses of a Fauci Flu shot, a “fully vaccinated” person’s immune system is lower than that of an unvaccinated person.\n\nGetting “boosted” with a so-called booster shot will not help, either. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), doing something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would never do, says that boosting only further damages the immune system and is not a smart, or even scientific, approach.\n\n“The decrease in immunity can be caused by several factors such as N1-methylpseudouridine, the spike protein, lipid nanoparticles, antibody-dependent enhancement, and the original antigenic stimulus,” Yamamoto writes.\n\n“These clinical alterations may explain the association reported between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles.” (Related: Covid injections also cause AIDS.)\n\nCovid jab spike proteins “do not immediately decay” following injection\n\nSome doctors are taking a different approach with their patients, urging them to avoid certain medications that, when combined with the shots, can increase their risk of causing harm.\n\n“These include limiting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen to maintain deep body temperature, appropriate use of antibiotics, smoking cessation, stress control, and limiting the use of lipid emulsions, including propofol, which may cause perioperative immunosuppression,” Yamamoto explains.\n\nThose with pre-existing health conditions should also avoid getting injected, despite claims from government agencies that the immunocompromised should be first in line for the shots.\n\nAnother thing The Lancet study revealed is the fact that the spike proteins in covid injections do not immediately decay as claimed. These spike proteins present on exosomes and circulate throughout the body for at least four months.\n\n“In addition,” Yamamoto further explains, “in vivo studies have shown that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) accumulate in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries, and that LNP-encapsulated mRNA is highly inflammatory.”\n\n“Newly generated antibodies of the spike protein damage the cells and tissues that are primed to produce spike proteins, and vascular endothelial cells are damaged by spike proteins in the bloodstream; this may damage the immune system organs such as the adrenal gland.”\n\nThe risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is also pronounced post-injection, particularly because infection-enhancing antibodies attenuate the impact of neutralizing antibodies, the job of which is to prevent infection.\n\nPut a different way, covid injection contents damage the body’s ability to prevent infection, which is the opposite of what is desired and supposedly accomplished by getting “vaccinated.”\n\n“The original antigenic sin, that is, the residual immune memory of the Wuhan-type vaccine may prevent the vaccine from being sufficiently effective against variant strains,” Yamamoto adds.\n\n“These mechanisms may also be involved in the exacerbation of COVID-19.”\n\nYamamoto further unpacks the shingles link to the jabs, as well as vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (VAIDS).\n\n“Since December 2021, besides COVID-19, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Okamura Memorial Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan (hereinafter referred to as ‘the institute’) has encountered cases of infections that are difficult to control,” he writes.\n\n“For example, there were several cases of suspected infections due to inflammation after open-heart surgery, which could not be controlled even after several weeks of use of multiple antibiotics. The patients showed signs of being immunocompromised, and there were a few deaths. The risk of infection may increase.”\n\nIn conclusion, the booster shot program absolutely needs to stop, unless people want to further degrade their already strained and damaged immune systems because of the first two injections.\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at Vaccines.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "NBA player Andrew Wiggins REGRETS taking the COVID clot shot\n\nA National Basketball Association (NBA) player expressed regret over receiving the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, even though he had a strong reason not to do so.\n\nAndrew Wiggins of reigning NBA champions Golden State Warriors said he regretted his decision to get the COVID-19 shot. “I still wish I didn’t get [the vaccine], to be honest with you,” remarked the 27-year-old.\n\nWiggins refused the vaccine throughout the season and even applied for a religious exemption, which was ultimately denied. The Warriors forward eventually got injected with the vaccine in October 2021 as a requirement for him to continue playing during the 2021-2022 NBA season.\n\nThis is because San Francisco, where his team’s home arena Chase Center is located, mandated the COVID-19 vaccine. The city banned any unvaccinated person over 12 years old from indoor events, including games and practices at the Chase Center.\n\n“I was an All-Star and [a] champion, so that was the good part. Just not missing out on the year, [which was] the best year of my career,” said Wiggins.\n\n“But for my body, I just don’t like putting all that stuff in my body, so I didn’t like that. It wasn’t my choice. I didn’t like that it was either ‘get this’ or ‘don’t play.'”\n\nAccording to the Warriors forward, he is the only member of his family that received the COVID-19 vaccine because “it’s not really something [they] believe in.”\n\nOther players who rejected the vaccine have adamantly stood by their decision to do so.\n\nBrooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving was banned from playing for his team during their home games at Barclays Center in New York City. It was only after NYC Mayor Eric Adams rescinded the city’s vaccine mandate for athletes that he was able to join his team on home games.\n\n“I can really say that I stood firm on what I believed in, what I wanted to do with my body,” said Irving. “I think that should be not just an American right, I think that should be a human right.”\n\nOrlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac likewise turned down the vaccine, saying that “it felt forced.” He elaborated: “It seemed that there was so much pressure in doing it. I don’t see the wisdom in putting something into my body that’s not going to stop me from getting the virus or transmitting it. That is why I decided to be the only player on my team to not get vaccinated.”\n\nTennis player also regrets getting COVID-19 vaccine\n\nWhile Wiggins expressed regret over his vaccination on one hand, he did not cite any vaccine injuries that led him to the decision. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case for French tennis player Jeremy Chardy.\n\nChardy, 35, spoke out against the Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccines after experiencing “violent pain” across his body that almost paralyzed him. Chardy, who was formerly the No. 73 male tennis player in the world, warned that there is “no hindsight” once the COVID shots have been injected. (Related: Tennis star Jeremy Chardy forced to quit playing after covid vaccine, “violent pain” means he “cannot play.”)\n\n“Suddenly, I cannot train; I cannot play,” he said, adding that he spoke with two doctors and took tests to determine what happened. “It’s frustrating because I started the year really well, I was playing really well. And then I went to the [Summer Olympic] Games, where I felt great too.”\n\nBecause of his vaccine injury, Chardy took the rest of the season off to take care of himself.\n\n“I prefer to take more time to heal myself and be sure that in the future, I won’t have a problem, rather than trying to get back on the court as quickly as possible and end up with more health problems. In my head, it’s difficult because I do not know how long it will last. And now, my season is at a standstill and I do not know when I will resume,” he said.\n\nChardy also touched on the possibility of his premature retirement from tennis because of the injuries from the COVID-19 shot.\n\n“It is especially frustrating that I do not have 10 years to play. Suddenly, now I regret having had the vaccine, but I could not know [what the consequences would be].”\n\nWatch InfoWars host Owen Shroyer as he talks about Philadelphia 76ers forward Matisse Thybulle, who was banned from playing after he refused the second COVID-19 vaccine dose.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nMelissa Red Pill lauds Bradley Beal for speaking up and representing unvaccinated NBA players – Brighteon.TV.\n\nFully vaxxed former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill suffers heart attack and is hospitalized with blood clots – blasts NBA player critical of COVID vax.\n\nNBA Hawks’ team managers tell player Brandon Goodwin to keep his MOUTH SHUT about blood clots from Covid-19 vaccine that ended his season and maybe his career.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nNYPost.com\n\nRT.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "BBC’s “vaccine is safe” for pregnant women “expert” just happens to also be principal investigator of Pfizer’s COVID injection in pregnancy trial\n\nProfessor Norman Fenton has been reporting on the bias of the BBC documentary ‘Unvaccinated’ which is being screened today, 20 July. It’s an attempt to convince those who have chosen not to have a Covid injection to “get jabbed.” It is a timely, eye-opening investigation commissioned by BBC Factual, the BBC claims without explaining why it is “timely” – presumably, they are hoping we believe, due most likely to the fraudulent use of PCR tests, “Covid-19 is on the rise again.”\n\n(Article by Rhoda Wilson republished from Expose-News.com)\n\nA search on both the internet and BBC’s website for “BBC Factual” returned no results which makes one wonder who actually commissioned BBC’s “investigation.” If any of our readers have any information about “BBC Factual” we would be grateful you noting it in the comments section under this article.\n\nIn this documentary, Prof. Fenton wrote, “mathematician Prof Hannah Fry – with the help of ‘experts’ – attempts to convince 7 members of the public (who have so far refused) to take the Covid vaccine. As I pointed out the BBC (in the publicity for the programme) already signposted the likely extreme bias in the programme by massive underestimating the number of unvaccinated people in the UK, hence trying to present such people as a tiny extreme fringe.”\n\nAnother so-called “expert” BBC used to help convince the unvaccinated – those who follow good science and are part of almost 30% of the UK population who have chosen to remain unvaccinated – is Asma Khalil.\n\nThe more we dig the worse it gets, Prof. Fenton wrote in a tweet. Here’s Asma Khalil, the “expert” they used to declare the “vaccine” safe for pregnant women:\n\nAnd as long ago as 2015 Asma Khalil declared these conflicts of interest as a member of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) Quality Standards Committee.\n\nResponding to Prof. Fenton’s tweet, Andy Sands neatly portrays BBC’s propaganda documentary:\n\nMore on BBC’s “Expert” Asma Khalil\n\nWe now know that Khalil is the principal investigator (“PI”) of the Pfizer Covid “vaccination” in pregnancy trial. We also know from a response to a Freedom of Information request alongside an in-depth dive into the only pregnancy/fertility study performed that Medicine Regulators and Pfizer chose to publicly cover up alarming abnormalities of the developing foetus and falsely downgraded the actual risk of Covid “vaccination” during pregnancy by suppressing documented findings of the clinical data.\n\nRead more: FOIA reveals Pfizer & Medicine Regulators hid dangers of COVID Vaccination during Pregnancy after Study found it increases risk of Birth Defects & Infertility and The Facts About Pfizer mRNA Vaccine Risks to Unborn Babies\n\nSo, is there anything else about Khalil that should set alarm bells ringing? Yes. There is more on Khalil in Professor Fenton’s article titled ‘BBC’s ‘independent vaccine expert’ just happens to be in charge of Pfizer’s Vaccine Centre’:\n\nIt turns out that she was a participant in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded simulation ‘Preparing for Disease X: Ensuring Vaccine Equity for Pregnant Women in Future Pandemics’ – the results of which are reported in THIS paper that she co-authored and was funded by:\n\nNote that there is no declaration by Asma Khalil (“AK”). This requires an explanation. Nor does AK declare any conflict of interests (“COIs”) in her other recent publications.\n\nSo, What Do the So-Called “Anti-Vaxxers” Actually Think?\n\nUnlike the BBC biased nonsense, Daily Sceptic published an article in May which described a rigorous study into the views of the unvaccinated. Rather than just listen to the lazy stereotypes of sceptics portrayed in the press, academia and Government, the authors of the study – Dr. Raminder Mulla, Amy Willows and Rusere Shoniwa – decided they would go and find out what people actually thought.\n\nA January 2021 study by Miguel et al concluded that people who shunned compliance with Covid containment measures were more likely to display “lower levels of empathy and higher levels of callousness, deceitfulness, and risk-taking”. Prompted by a desire to foster genuine understanding between different sides of the Covid camp, a new study led by Dr. Raminder Mulla dug into this question. The study titled ‘Looking into their eyes’ found, unsurprisingly, that this vilified group are anything but baby killers or terrorists. Crucially, they did not evince the stereotypical tropes about ‘anti-vaxxers’ that have been propagated in corporate and social media. Simply put, the participants believe that lockdowns were a state overreach. They oppose lockdowns because of the burden placed on the entire population irrespective of risk, the collateral damage caused, and the imposition on civil liberties and individual freedom. Addressing the label “anti-vax” directly, the study finds that most of its participants were not opposed to vaccination in principle but did express doubts about the rapid development and deployment of the current Covid vaccines and their side effects. None of the study participants subscribed to unusual theories, referencing 5G or nanobots, with which this group is often stereotyped. Delving into the participants’ values, the study finds that most emphasised personal responsibility and autonomy in health and other affairs and the importance of the maxim to ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’ Despite the disappointment, some interviewees expressed with those who unquestioningly complied with the Covid narrative, they did not wish them harm or inconvenience. In contrast, other studies have shown that this attitude of non-malevolence is not reciprocated by the compliant towards the non-compliant, whom the compliant view as deserving of unemployment, impoverishment and censorship.

        "Alnylam Pharmaceuticals claims Pfizer, Moderna infringed on its patent rights to make COVID-19 vaccines\n\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals has escalated its patent fight against Pfizer and Moderna, claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines of the two companies have infringed on its recently acquired patent.\n\nThis recent escalation in the patent fight is over the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used by Pfizer and Moderna in developing their respective COVID-19 vaccines. Alnylam originally filed separate lawsuits against each of them back in March.\n\nOn July 12, Alnylam submitted additional documents to reinforce its case against both Big Pharma companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. These new documents claim that Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA delivery systems violate Alnylam’s patent on lipid nanoparticle technology for delivering genetic material into human cells and how these lipid nanoparticles are manufactured. (Related: BOMBSHELL: Fauci owns patent on SARS-CoV-2 gp120 HIV insertion, which destroys the body’s cancer-killing T cells.)\n\nPatent No. 11,246,933 covers “a breakthrough class of cationic biodegradable lipids used to form lipid nanoparticles that carry and deliver” mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted the patent to Alnylam on the same day the pharmaceutical company filed its additional complaints in federal court. Alnylam claimed in all of its lawsuits that its technology is “essential” to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe company is seeking royalties from the sale of the COVID-19 vaccines. Alnylam is not seeking to pull Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines from the market.\n\nAlnylam is just the latest biotechnology company to file a patent lawsuit this year over the lipid nanoparticle technology in Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines. CureVac, a German pharmaceutical company that specializes in mRNA-based treatments, earlier sued BioNTech, Pfizer’s German partner in developing the COVID-19 vaccine, claiming that four of its patents were infringed.\n\nModerna, Pfizer deny allegations of patent infringement\n\nIn response to the recent lawsuit, Moderna responded by referring to a statement posted on its website back in May when it moved to dismiss Alnylam’s claim, contending that the suit was not appropriate for a district court.\n\n“Under federal law, claims against U.S. government-contracted suppliers must proceed against the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims,” wrote Moderna. The law the company is referencing provides protections for authorized government contractors like Moderna.\n\n“Moderna’s lipids do not resemble Alnylam’s work,” the company added. “Any assertion that the Alnylam patent covers Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is specious and, as a result, Alnylam’s claims will fail even if Alnylam complies with the statutory requirements and refiles in the Court of Federal Claims against the U.S. government.”\n\nAs of press time, Pfizer has not responded to Alnylam’s recent lawsuit. But Pfizer commented on Alnylam’s original claim by saying that the company’s patent played no role in the success of its COVID-19 vaccine, and that its vaccine “falls outside the scope of what Alnylam actually invented.” Pfizer also called Alnylam’s attempt to take it to court over alleged patent rights a clear-cut case of seeking improper economic benefits.\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have made tens of billions of dollars each in sales from their COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer anticipates earning $32 billion in vaccine sales this year, and Moderna predicts $21 billion in vaccine sales. Any successful infringement claims, either from Alnylam or any other pharmaceutical company whose patent rights were allegedly violated, could end up being very lucrative.\n\nLearn more about Big Pharma companies at BigPharmaNews.com.\n\nWatch this clip of Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel confessing to having patented the COVID-19 spike protein more than three years before the pandemic.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nPfizer petitions court to dismiss whistleblower lawsuit because government was fully aware of fraud when agreeing to work with company.\n\nMore evidence emerges indicating that COVID-19 was “manufactured” in a Chinese lab, then Moderna patented it.\n\nNIH claims co-ownership of Moderna COVID vaccine patent, demonstrating how taxpayer money is used to develop therapeutics that make drug companies wealthy.\n\nReport says Chinese scientist filed for a coronavirus vaccine patent BEFORE the pandemic.\n\nFOUL PLAY?

        "Deborah Birx hid covid info from Trump, altered CDC guidelines without approval\n\nA key member of President Donald Trump’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) task force now admits that she basically did her own thing throughout the plandemic, possibly illegally, without the knowledge or permission of the administration.\n\nDeborah Birx, the infamous “scarfed lady” who often appeared alongside Tony Fauci and Trump himself during briefings, says she took it upon herself to manipulate data and publish her own agenda on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Birx’s insubordination ultimately guided horrific covid policies such as testing, lockdowns, and masking.\n\n“I devised a work-around for the governor’s reports I was then writing,” Birx admits in her new book, which is little more than a confessional grift.\n\n“Instead of including those recommendations in the common bulleted list, I’d include them in the pandemic summary and state-specific recommendations in the governor’s reports, where they wouldn’t be so obvious.”\n\nBirx goes on in her memoir to explain in detail how she would go through covid documents and manipulate the information in such a way as to make it minimally detectable by her superiors.\n\n“After the heavily edited documents were returned to me, I’d reinsert what they had objected to, but place it in those different locations,” she admits.\n\n“I’d also reorder and restructure the bullet points so the most salient – the points the administration objected to most – no longer fell at the start of the bullet points. I shared these strategies with the three members of the data team also writing these reports.”\n\nBirx’s Saturday and Sunday report-writing routine, she brags, “soon became: write, submit, revise, hide, resubmit,” a strategic sleight-of-hand that she says “worked” as planned.\n\nRepublican Matt Mowers helped Birx street the covid agenda without Trump and his close confidants knowing about it\n\nIt turns out that Birx had help – from a Republican, no less – who covered for her while she quietly and secretly steered the covid agenda in favor of Fauci’s vision rather than Trump’s.\n\nWhile the Trump administration wanted to do away with testing, for instance, Birx, with the help of Matt Mowers, her former Chief of Staff in the State Department, was able to keep it in place as a key component of the multi-year plandemic.\n\nAfter discovering that former CDC director – appointed by Trump – Robert Redfield agreed with her that Trump’s efforts to do away with testing was the wrong route, Birx conspired with Redfield to “quietly rewrite the guidance and post it to the CDC website” without Trump and his closest people knowing about it.\n\n“We would not seek approval,” Birx admits. “Because we were both quite busy, it might take a week or two, but we were committed to subverting the dangerous message that limiting testing was the right thing to do.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mowers, who is currently running for Congress in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, was running cover for Birx on Twitter, praising her for her “leadership in this response.”\n\n“We are in good hands,” Mowers tweeted on March 13, 2020, along with a video of Birx speaking on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\nAt one point, then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reamed Birx out for her insubordination, to which she doubled down in defense of it.\n\n“I did what I needed to do,” Birx told Meadows at the time.\n\nWhat Birx did was probably illegal, which means she now needs to face justice for her crimes. The same is true of Mowers, whose campaign in New Hampshire deserves to crash and burn, followed by a full investigation into these two.\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus plandemic and the key players like Birx, who made it work, can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheNationalPulse.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Church of COVID: Washington, DC pushing “Faith in Vaccines” program to inject churchgoers with clot shots\n\nPublic health bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. are now encouraging people to put their faith in the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines through the “Faith in Vaccine” program. The move, incidentally, sounds similar to state-sanctioned, cult-like behavior.\n\nThe District of Columbia Department of Health (DC Health) launched the program in 2021 by partnering with places of worship in the federal capital to host pop-up vaccine centers in their establishments. The program sought to convince the community that the vaccines were “safe and effective,” and provide support for residents wanting to be injected. To this end, DC Health partnered with the Leadership Council for Healthy Communities and the Black Coalition against COVID.\n\n“The whole goal of Faith in Vaccine is to bring vaccines into the community for easy access, where folks feel comfortable and have confidence in the community,” explained DC Health spokesman Dr. Ankoor Shah. (Related: Joy Behar demands Black people trust COVID vaccines because ‘the experiment has been done on White people’.)\n\nAccording to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s (NAACP) Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Faith in Vaccine clinics “are hosted at local churches where residents can receive information about the COVID-19 vaccine, ask questions, and be vaccinated on-site. The program is an example of “information interventions” recommended by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to “promote equity in vaccine distribution.”\n\nThe Faith in Vaccine program has often advertised free perks to new parishioners, such as free backpacks and free masks to children who get injected with the COVID-19 clot shot at places of worship.\n\nHowever, Faith in Vaccine – which centers mainly on Christian churches – is not the first religious, faith-based initiative to “combat” COVID-19. Back in 2020 before the vaccines were developed, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) joined forces with different world religions to launch the Global Multi-Religious Faith-in-Action COVID-19 Initiative. The initiative commenced in April 2020 aimed to “raise awareness of the impact of the pandemic” on children.\n\nThe UNICEF initiative reflected on the “unique and critical roles played by religious leaders and actors, in influencing values, attitudes, behaviors and actions” that affect the development and well-being of children, and expressed commitment to strengthening multi-religious actions and community mobilization in countering the pandemic.\n\nPredominantly Black Washington, DC hounded by racial disparities in vaccination\n\nThe Faith in Vaccine initiative was incidentally launched in the federal capital, often referred to as “Chocolate City” due to its historically high percentage of Black residents.\n\nAccording to the NAACP, Blacks made up three-fourths of all COVID-19 deaths in Washington, D.C. even though they comprise 45 percent of the city population. It mentioned that the 30 percent gap is the largest compared to all other states and territories in the United States. Michigan followed with a mere 10 percent gap, while both New York and Louisiana had a seven percent gap.\n\n“Even though three-quarters of the D.C. residents who have lost their lives to the COVID-19 pandemic are Black – [they] have received a little over a quarter of the vaccines distributed in D.C. thus far. In contrast, White D.C. residents have received vaccinations three times their rate of deaths from COVID-19,” said the civil rights group.\n\nThe NAACP continued that Black residents of the federal capital “experience different barriers to access the vaccines, including the heavy reliance on internet access to register, insufficient call center capacity due to limited phone access, and a website that lacked the overall capacity to handle incoming requests.”\n\nUltimately, independent journalist Jordan Schachtel noted that the COVID-19 vaccines do not work as promised, regardless of the ethnicities of people who get injected with them.\n\n“There’s no evidence that the vaccines are working, and that’s why it’s important to have faith,” he remarked\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more updates about the COVID-19 vaccine rollout worldwide.\n\nWatch the video below to learn more about churches opening to push vaccines.\n\nThis video is from the Raymond7779 channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nArchbishop Vigano denounces Catholic Church’s endorsement of dangerous COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBeing a “vaccine heretic” against the church of big pharma; Co-opting scientific research.\n\nCoalition of Austrian clergymen denounces Vienna’s COVID vaccine mandate.\n\nYouTube bans covid prayer videos, only vaccine worship allowed.\n\nSources include:\n\nGlobalResearch.ca\n\nNAACPLDF.org\n\nUNICEF.org\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Scott Kesterson: Military COVID-19 vaccine mandate a ploy to get rid of soldiers who would disobey illegal orders – Brighteon.TV\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate for members of the United States Armed Forces is a ploy to get rid of anybody who would refuse to carry out unconstitutional or illegal orders.\n\nThis is according to Scott Kesterson, host of “BardsFM,” who made the claim on the July 21 episode of his show on Brighteon.TV.\n\n“The military’s primary objective right now is getting rid of those that would object to illegal orders,” said Kesterson. “The function of the vax guarantees that those core people that refuse to listen to orders and have proclaimed that the … mandatory vaccinations were illegal orders, the military wants them out.”\n\n“Those should be our heroes, they should be our new leadership in the military, but that’s not what the military sees,” he continued. Kesterson added that the American Deep State has essentially purged the military because it wants soldiers to take an active role in cracking down on dissent.\n\nKesterson noted that the military’s powers are being increased at a steady pace. The military is already working with Homeland Security in several ways, including surveilling Americans on the internet, and Democrats in the House of Representatives are suggesting blocking Congress from the oversight of the military and National Guard when they are deployed domestically. (Related: FBI using counterterrorism resources on parents who oppose school mask mandates.)\n\nAs the economy collapses and as the federal government expands its powers under the guise of so-called climate change, the possibility of the entire military being used to enforce this future “is becoming increasingly real,” Kesterson added.\n\nTens of thousands of soldiers to be purged from the Army and National Guard\n\nBased on recent data from the U.S. Army, as many as 40,000 National Guardsmen and 22,000 Army Reserve soldiers have refused to take COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhile these reservists and guardsmen have not been officially discharged from either the military or the National Guard, the U.S. Army has cut them off from their military benefits, making staying extremely difficult.\n\n“Soldiers who refuse the vaccination order without an approved or pending exemption request are subject to adverse administrative actions, including flags, bars to service and official reprimands,” said an Army spokesperson in a statement.\n\nActive service members who refused to be vaccinated have already been disciplined, court-martialed or discharged. Others were even forced to pay back scholarships, education and other privileges they availed of using their status as active members of the military.\n\nThe announcement noted that this represented 13 percent of the Army National Guard and 12 percent of the Army Reserve. In six states alone, between 20 to 30 percent of Army guardsmen are unvaccinated and at risk of dismissal. In 43 other states, over 10 percent of Guard troops remain unvaccinated.\n\nFurthermore, another 3,000 Army reservists and Army National Guard members who filed for religious exemption requests did not have their requests granted.\n\n“We are losing many of our best warriors with real combat and leadership experience from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of war, which cannot be replaced,” warned Jonathan Hullihan, an attorney who served as a Navy JAG officer for over 13 years. “If military leadership fails to portray a candid and accurate threat to the Biden Administration that these actions directly threaten the United States’ national security, Congress must intervene.”\n\nWatch this July 21 episode of “BardsFM” as host Scott Kesterson goes into detail regarding the COVID-19 vaccine mandates in America.\n\n“BardsFM” with Scott Kesterson airs every Sunday at 6-7 p.m., Thursday at 5-6 p.m. and Saturday at 4-5 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nMore related articles:\n\nVaccine mandates, military vaccine injuries continue to threaten national security by killing our soldiers.\n\nHouse Republicans introduce bill to reinstate military service members discharged for not complying with COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\n\nHouse Republicans calling for ban on using taxpayer funds for implementing military vaccine mandate.\n\nOur nation’s security is at risk due to Biden’s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nWashingtonTimes.com\n\nTheCenterSquare.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Global campaign aims to break silence around COVID vaccine injuries\n\nThe founders of a new online campaign — #CanWeTalkAboutIt — hope to break the culture of silence around COVID-19 vaccine injuries by encouraging people injured by the vaccines to share their personal stories.\n\n(Article by Michael Nevradakis republished from TheEpochTimes.com)\n\nLaunched last month with a live online “Let’s Talk” webcast, #CanWeTalkAboutIt brings together the vaccine-injured with medical experts willing to speak out about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe campaign also seeks to help people injured by the vaccines network and locate resources and information in their own countries and communities.\n\nIt also invites them to submit a black-and-white photo, with their right sleeve rolled up, wearing a band-aid to symbolize that they got the vaccine, and share the post, with a short description of the injuries they experienced, on their social media networks with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt hashtag.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender, Agnieszka Wilson, one of the founders of the campaign, said she became aware of questions surrounding the safety of various vaccines after sustaining a probable vaccine injury — rheumatoid arthritis, which she developed after she got the Tdap vaccine — during her pregnancy.\n\nThis incident led her to discover the silence that often accompanies vaccine injuries.\n\n“If you take a headache pill and you see that there’s a side effect that makes your skin blue, then you obviously might say ‘okay, it might be from that, right?’” Wilson said. “But when it comes to vaccines, you can’t really talk about these things.”\n\nWilson said that the silence led her to do her own research on vaccine injuries.\n\n“That’s when I dug into this whole new level of silence that I didn’t know about, regarding vaccines,” she said.\n\nWilson said that she wanted to do more than just conduct her own research. She wanted “to do something about it,” she said — which led her to start the New York Medical Freedom Coalition when she lived in the U.S.\n\nAfter returning to her native Sweden, Wilson launched her own interview program, the “Aga Wilson Show,” on which she interviews doctors and scientists.\n\nThrough this program, Wilson became aware about the looming risk of injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe also noted silence on the part of the mainstream media and a reluctance from ordinary people to speak openly about such issues.\n\n“We all heard and knew that the rollout [of COVID vaccines] was starting and we were going to see a lot of damage done by these vaccines,” Wilson told The Defender.\n\n“But people were really scared, and especially [scared of] being associated with … organizations that were stamped as anti-vax organizations.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“We all also knew that media was silencing it. These people were denied that these were vaccine injuries [but] we were seeing all of these things happening. So I thought, we need to do something, we need to start making people aware that these are actually dangerous vaccines.”\n\nWilson’s interviews with experts and her discussions with people injured by the vaccines led her to realize “how completely excluded they are.”\n\nWilson said:\n\n“There’s no disease in the world where you cannot talk about it … you can talk about cancer, you can talk about any kind of disease out there, but not this.\n\n“They have scientists that are willing to do research on this, scientists from the big institutions, and they’re just being ignored.”\n\nThe media is complicit in this silence, she said. “There’s something more going on than just this. Why is media being silent? Why are we not talking about this?”\n\n“There’s never been a drug in history that has had so many side effects and no one is talking about it,” she said.\n\nWilson’s concerns about the side effects, silence on the part of doctors and scientists, and the media’s complicity led her to start the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign.\n\nShe said:\n\n“I always work globally; I thought now we need to do something globally, we need to do a campaign that’s going to start breaking the silence around this issue because people need to know.\n\n“We don’t want any more people to take the shot, especially after what I’m seeing in all of these groups.”\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine during its clinical trial, got involved with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign soon after its launch.\n\nDressen, whose non-profit organization, React19, offers “financial, physical, and emotional support for those suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine adverse events globally,” told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign resonated with her.\n\nDressen said she was not only compelled to speak out, but also to help others do the same. “Speaking out, especially in today’s climate, is especially difficult.”\n\n“The injured largely trust other injured,” she said. “We have been exploited and used so many times by people who just don’t quite take the time to understand the impact they can have on us and our health.”\n\nDressen described the situation as a “double whammy” for the injured, as they “have been censored and stripped of any ability to have a voice by one side, and when we do speak out, many times the tone from those who wish to use our stories is tone-deaf, dehumanizing.”\n\n“So, the injured clam up and huddle together in support groups with only each other,” Dressen said.\n\nCampaigns and support groups such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt play an important role in amplifying the voices of people whose individual ability to be heard or to enact change is limited.\n\nDressen said:\n\n“This campaign, in large part due to the simple and appropriate messaging, was able to strike the appropriate balance for the injured to feel confident enough to speak out. It was also a way for the rest of the world to see us move in unison across the globe.\n\n“It is challenging for sick people to fight for ourselves. Our energy is extremely limited. So instructions and campaigns need to align with not only our personal values but with our ability to physically tolerate the stress of the advocacy work being asked of us.\n\n“It is important that compassionate messaging and respect be there in order for us to feel safe enough to speak out and share our stories.”\n\nThe culture of silence described by Wilson and Dressen extends to social media, where specific keywords are frequently censored by the platforms.\n\nDressen said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign took into account this reality in its planning.\n\n“We already knew what words were going to get shadowbanned, so the strategy was to come up with messaging that sends the right message without outright using these words,” she said.\n\n“I am very careful with my own messaging through our non-profit [React19] to ensure messaging is forward-thinking, has a positive slant. Instead of ‘STOP’ or ‘DON’T,’ we use ‘pro-safety,’ ‘pro-informed consent,’ etc.”\n\nWilson told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has three primary objectives, the first being to provide the vaccine-injured with visibility and a voice.\n\nShe said:\n\n“People are being bullied … for being vaccine-injured, and no one believes them. So we tried to … create a safe space for these people to speak their stories, but also for others.\n\n“How do we involve the public in this? We want others to support them. That’s why there’s two sides of the campaign. One is for them to tell their stories, but the other is for people to actually acknowledge them and see them because they’re not being seen.”\n\n#CanWeTalkAboutIt also aims to give the public the ability to make an informed decision regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“The second [objective] is to raise awareness publicly so that people understand the risks with the vaccine and hopefully make an informed decision,” Dressen said.\n\n“Informed consent is not being given in the situation and the doctors are also not doing their job when it comes to swearing the oath ‘do no harm.’ So we want people to be aware.”\n\nFundraising is the campaign’s third objective, according to Wilson, with the purpose of “supporting all of these organizations out there that are doing the work to find solutions for the vaccine.”\n\nIndeed, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has partnered with a number of organizations, including Children’s Health Defense Europe, the American Health & Freedom Coalition, the World Freedom Alliance, the World Council for Health and Millions Against Medical Mandates.\n\nThe campaign also collaborates with local and country-based groups “that already have their communities in place.”\n\nOne of the goals of these local partnerships is to help the vaccine-injured find support groups near them.\n\n“We’re pulling together those groups … because we want to build communities right on the website as well, so that people can find each other,” Wilson said.\n\nNetworking is just one of the components of the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign, according to Wilson. The campaign also wants to host more live webcasts, like the June 17 inaugural event.\n\nAccording to Wilson, the event brought together “five experts and five injured, who … shared their stories and shared what they have been through in terms of adverse events or adverse reactions,” allowing for a discussion with the experts on these issues.\n\n“The most important thing was that this conversation is so needed and we need to continue it because we need to do more research, more surveys,” Wilson said.\n\n“We need to have people tell their stories so that the experts can understand what is going on. … We will continue having webinars more focused on specific topics so that we can get to the bottom with this and also support the campaign.”\n\nBy sharing the stories of the vaccine-injured, campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can help such individuals avoid continuously recounting their stories and reliving an event that may have been highly traumatic for them.\n\nWilson said:\n\n“We need to understand the trauma that these people are going through, and listen to them. Our job really is to ask them how we can create a safe space.\n\n“Some of them … don’t want to tell their stories over and over again. It comes back to their trauma and they relive it, while others who are the spokespeople are actually the ones who maybe are more comfortable doing that.”\n\nAnother challenge faced by the vaccine-injured is that their concerns are frequently dismissed by doctors.\n\n“Not only are they not being heard or … the doctors are not listening, but basically they’re not getting help,” Wilson said, citing this example:\n\n“We had one Swedish woman who was part of the webinar and she was telling us how she just goes from one doctor to another and they just keep sending her back and forth and no one can tell her what’s going on.\n\n“People have a very hard time because they just keep being dismissed. A lot of them are being sent home, [told] that they have anxiety, even though they have severe symptoms which could not be explained by just anxiety.”\n\nDressen, who experienced adverse events within an hour of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine on Nov. 4, 2020, told The Defender how doctors dismissed her.\n\n“Within the first year I saw close to 40 doctors, and had well over 60 office visits, a trip to the NIH [National Institutes of Health], and several hospital stays,” she said.\n\n“I was plagued by an ‘anxiety’ diagnosis for six months until I was able to go to the NIH. NIH confirmed it was post-vaccine neuropathy, and one internist confirmed the same after the NIH made the initial diagnosis.”\n\nThis “anxiety” diagnosis came despite a broad array of symptoms, Dressen said:\n\n“My reaction started within an hour of my shot and was tingling down the same arm as my shot. From there my health declined over the next 2.5 weeks with double and blurry vision, sound sensitivity, tachycardia at rest, sweating, brain fog, dissociation, limb weakness, internal vibrations (that still haunt me to this day), confusion, vibrations in my brain, tinnitus, hair loss, severe nerve pain, etc. I had well over 30 symptoms.\n\n“I ended up in the hospital because my legs stopped working. I remember my husband standing over my bed begging my medical teams to just run one more test, look at one more thing. Without him, there is no question I would be dead.\n\n“I was sent home with in-home physical and occupational therapy to recoup my legs, retrain my bladder and learn how to do simple tasks like sort a box of toys … and a diagnosis of ‘anxiety.’’’\n\nSeveral of these symptoms continue to the present day, according to Dressen.\n\n“I still have well over half of my symptoms: leg weakness, neuropathy, tinnitus, POTS [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome], internal electrical feelings. But the sound sensitivity and light sensitivity are gone,” she said.\n\nDressen pays $1,100 out-of-pocket every two weeks for intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n“This is just one medication I need to stay alive,” she said. “This has impacted my life financially, physically and emotionally. My family’s life and finances are now dramatically different.”\n\nDressen’s injuries — and her experiences with doctors — led her to testify before Congress, testify before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, and participate in a press conference of vaccine-injured individuals organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAccording to Dressen:\n\n“My message to lawmakers is pretty simple: after being to the NIH for research and after participating in dialogue with the heads of the FDA for over a year now, I know the government simply is not doing their job.\n\n“We did our part. We did what we were told and were assured over and over that if something were to go wrong that there would be a safety net. But instead of a safety net, there is a huge gaping hole.\n\n“How long do the injured need to wait before these health agencies do their job? People are suffering now, they are dying now, they are out of work now. They can’t wait 5, 10, 20 years for the intentionally slow wheel of government process to move forward. The pace we are going right now, progress is so miniscule that we all will be dead before the government makes this right.”\n\nThis slow and ponderous pace is, in part, due to “special interests, lobbyists and a whole lot of money,” Dressen said, which “have corrupted the process by which individuals like myself can attain proper medical care, engage in research on pharmaceutical harms and receive proper — or any — compensation.”\n\nFor Dressen, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can play a role in pressuring governments and public health agencies to do the right thing.\n\n“The #canWeTalkAboutIt campaign is an effort to bridge that gap between these many sides and provide a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn.”\n\nWilson told The Defender that she would like to see the social media campaign of #CanWeTalkAboutIt get bigger, “so that we can actually go viral and … [inform] the public that this is a serious issue.”\n\n“There are millions of people suffering from vaccine injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine,” Wilson said. “We need people’s help to share so that we can reach out to the masses and warn them that there are huge risks with taking this vaccine.”\n\nDressen’s message to the vaccine-injured is that “you’re not alone.”\n\n“Never give up, never give in,” Dressen said. “There is one thing this community has that is unlike anything I have ever experienced and it is an enormous ability to love and support one another.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“For those who are still trapped in their beds just trying to hang on by the hour or by the minute? That little bit of love and compassion could be the difference between life and death.”\n\nFor Wilson, the phrase “strength in numbers” applies to those who are vaccine-injured.\n\n“We don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” Wilson said. “We just want people to be able to know who’s out there doing what and where the vaccine-injured can find protocols, communities, to educate them.”\n\nWilson added:\n\n“We need more stories. We need to understand what’s going on in order to do our job. So we want to bring together everyone under this campaign to start collaborating … and support one another, to really have a bigger impact.\n\n“It’s time for us to come together and organize better because we’re stronger together. And that’s how we can actually make an impact.”\n\nWilson said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign also wants to raise funds to research vaccine injuries because governments aren’t doing it.\n\n“With this many vaccine injuries, it’s mind-boggling and absolutely unacceptable for the government and the medical establishment not to go into studies,” she said.\n\nDressen expressed a similar sentiment regarding the responsibilities of governments toward the vaccine-injured, and the advocacy role campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can play in promoting the reform of existing vaccine compensation programs.\n\n“HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] needs to address the failing, under-powered and under-funded compensation program,” Dressen said.\n\nShe added:\n\n“Similar to the [Vaccine Injury Compensation Program] vaccine tax that requires drugmakers to pay into a fund to pay for injuries, Washington can draft legislation that will require these drugmakers to pay a similar minimal tax into a fund for independent research on the potential harms of their products. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for this research.”\n\nSuch efforts can also target the coordinated actions of social media platforms and other entities to classify any news about vaccine injuries as “misinformation” and to subsequently quash it.\n\nDressen said such practices do not just stifle free speech, they also cause material harm for the vaccine-injured.\n\n“The word ‘misinformation’ is a powerful weapon that divides and dehumanizes,” Dressen said.\n\nThe #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can bring the public into the mix, by providing “a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn,” and also by empowering the public to drive change without waiting for governmental bodies to act, Dressen said.\n\n“The tools to fix this are not just the responsibility of the government. We The People have the power and obligation to unify and demand change. And when that change doesn’t happen, it is our job to enact change.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“Divided we fall. But together, our voice is powerful and can drive change. But in order to do that, we must listen and learn first. Can we talk about it?”\n\nRead more at: TheEpochTimes.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Birx admits she and Fauci made up “the science” on social distancing, lockdowns\n\nJust about everything that was forced on Americans throughout the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic came from “science” that Deborah Birx says she and Tony Fauci made up on the fly.\n\nBirx recently wrote a book that contains numerous admissions about the crimes she committed while working as Donald Trump’s Covid-19 Task Force adviser, one of them being that social distancing and lockdowns needed just “two weeks to stop the spread.”\n\nBirx and Fauci pulled these ideas out of their behinds, not from any actual science like the duo originally claimed. Furthermore, Birx now admits that she lied to the former president about what was needed in order to “flatten the curve.”\n\n“No sooner had we convinced the Trump administration to implement our version of the two-week shutdown than I was trying to figure out how to extend,” Birx boasts in her memoir, which fully incriminates her. (Related: Birx also tampered with CDC data and hid information from the Trump administration.)\n\nSince she knows that there is no more justice left in America, Birx is apparently unphased without a care in the world concerning her admissions. After all, when was the last time a corrupt government official was held accountable for committing crimes against humanity?\n\n“So that 15 days to slow the spread was just a sneaky way to get their hooks into us so they could lock us down for longer,” said Fox News‘ Jesse Water in a recent segment about Birx and Fauci’s crimes against humanity.\n\n“And if you dared to leave your house, Birx told us, the only way to stay safe was to social distance.”\n\nYou can watch the Waters segment below:\n\nDr. Birx ADMITS her and Fauci LIED to Trump and America about how to stop COVID— They ALTERED the reports?! pic.twitter.com/GlhonaKoYi — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 20, 2022\n\nDr. Peter McCullough says “scarf lady” Birx committed scientific fraud and misled the president\n\nBirx and Fauci spun a number of lies throughout the plandemic that cost people their jobs, their livelihoods and in many cases their lives, which makes them complicit in mass murder.\n\nThe American people suffered greatly under the arbitrary policies of Birx and Fauci, who relied not on science but on their own delusions and fantasies in crafting policy throughout the manufactured crisis.\n\n“I had settled on 10 (feet) knowing that even that was too many, but I figured that ten would at least be palatable for most Americans,” Birx nonchalantly writes in her book about how she came up with her social distancing number.\n\nOn Twitter, Dr. Peter McCullough, MD, who has been outspokenly opposed to all the restrictions throughout the plandemic, wrote that Birx, whom he and many others call the “scarf lady,” committed serious scientific fraud and misled Trump throughout his tenure.\n\nMcCullough says that Americans were forced by Birx and Fauci “into unnecessary lockdowns and restrictions based on the false presumption that the virus spread among healthy people (asymptomatic spread),” a concept that was disproven by actual scientists who looked into the matter independently.\n\n“They cost our country trillions of dollars and they made it up?” asked someone who reads Zero Hedge about the economic impact of Birx and Fauci’s impositions.\n\n“Well, at least the trust has been irreparably damaged now,” responded another about how nobody trusts the American government anymore. “There’s no going back.”\n\n“The few braindead folks still volunteering to wear a mask are either beyond help or are just doing it as a retarded political statement … Always remember it was always about getting that ‘vaccine’ pumped into as many people as possible.

        "Dr. Jason Dean tells Robert Scott Bell: Fighting pandemic misinformation can restore the American Republic – Brighteon.TV\n\nDr. Jason Dean expressed optimism that the American Republic can be restored by fighting misinformation surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n“As much as I despise what’s occurred the last two years, there has been a silver lining. I never expected this to happen as fast as it did. People are now waking up to vaccines and not just COVID-19 – but the entire vaccine schedule,” he said during an interview on the July 18 episode of “The Robert Scott Bell Show” on Brighteon.TV.\n\nHost Robert Scott Bell argued that the misinformation stemmed from “mind-control” programs instilled by “health experts.” (Related: The worst Covid MISINFORMATION SPREADERS on the planet.)\n\n“You’re exposed to mold and you cough or sneeze, then it is COVID-19. The programming is out there. And if they just say the virus is still spreading, most people innocently enough and they’re not part of the agenda, will go ‘COVID-19 is still spreading,'” he said.\n\n“There are still enough folks out there believing what they’re told in the news by the president or what [Dr. Anthony] Fauci is saying.”\n\nDean cited an old video by author and podcast host Dr. Bill Deagle from the 1980s that talked about how the vaccines will reprogram people’s bodies and implant memories into their own minds. The BraveTV founder noticed that Deagle’s points were similar to the ideas espoused by the World Economic Forum.\n\n“We still have to recognize that there’s still education and teaching that has to happen along this way.”\n\nDean calls on people to unlearn the programming\n\nDean also pointed out that it is likewise important for the public to be “unschooled,” or to unlearn information that had been instilled in their minds. He added that the public should unplug the entire faulty sources of information for re-education to work.\n\n“Did you know that 80 percent of illness is psychosomatic? It means that people with negative thoughts and spiritual life could be a mess, and we got to unplug them from something.”\n\nAccording to Dean, people must be able to say that the body is self-healing. He challenged viewers: “You’re [going to] fix the physical problem of it, that is fine. But how about saying ‘I have healing?'”\n\n“You need to start working on controlling your thinking. As we move into this new realm of healthcare, we will need to start consciously thinking about what we have versus what we don’t have. Think abundance, family, love, etc., and start walking away from these labels and diagnoses.”\n\nBell, meanwhile, called on the general public to stop worshipping authoritarianism or authority – whether it be medical, government or otherwise.\n\n“That’s a vulnerability that we have: We always look for ‘experts’ to stop the disease,” he said. “You got to become your own expert.”\n\nDean ultimately called on Americans to be vigilant if they wish to restore the republic.\n\n“We’re going to build our republic back again … [but] you’re always going to be fighting the fight. It doesn’t end. You have to educate your kids on how to understand what a republic is, why we have it [and] why you have to follow what’s going on in your local politics.”\n\nWatch the full July 18 episode of “The Robert Scott Bell Show” with Dr. Jason Dean below.

        "Vaccinated population accounts for 92% of COVID-19 deaths in Canada\n\nRecent official figures published by the Canadian government revealed that the vaccinated population now accounts for 92 percent of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths across Canada. Nearly half of those deaths are among the quadruple jabbed population.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration continues to downplay the gravity of the situation by providing a tally of cases, hospitalizations and deaths that stretches all the way back to December 14, 2020. That included a huge wave of deaths that occurred in January 2021, when just 0.3 percent of the Canadian population was considered fully vaccinated.\n\nBut news website the Expose used Wayback Machine to find what the Canadian government is concealing in regard to the correlation between the vaccination status and Canada’s current death rate. The said browser application is a digital archive of the worldwide web that captures, manages and searches collections of digital content without any technical expertise or hosting facilities.\n\nThe Expose found a chart showing the number of COVID-19 deaths across Canada by vaccination status between June 9 and June 19.\n\nDuring the said period, there were 4,954 COVID-19 deaths recorded and the vaccinated population accounted for 3,796 of them. The 135 deaths were among the partly vaccinated, 1,174 deaths among those who had two shots and 2,487 deaths among the triple vaccinated.\n\nIn summary, the unvaccinated population accounted for just eight percent of the deaths, but the vaccinated accounted for 92 percent – 44 percent of which were among the quadruple jabbed and 45 percent of which were among people vaccinated thrice. (Related: Eighty percent of those DYING from “covid” in Canada are fully jabbed.)\n\nThe analysis also found 20,842 COVID-19 cases reported during the said period. There were 19,405 cases from the vaccinated, including 13,987 among the quadruple vaccinated. The unvaccinated population accounted for a minimal seven percent of the cases, while the vaccinated population accounted for 93 percent – 72 percent of which were among the quadruple jabbed.\n\nAs for the hospitalizations, 1,377 COVID-19 cases were recorded on the same period, with the vaccinated population accounting for 1,168, including 764 quadruple jabbed. This means that only 15 percent of those hospitalized due to COVID-19 were from the unvaccinated population, while the vaccinated population accounted for 85 percent – 65 percent of which were quadruple jabbed.\n\n“These aren’t the kind of figures we should be seeing for a COVID-19 injection that is allegedly 95 percent effective against infection, hospitalization and death,” the Expose said.\n\nCanadian airports revive COVID-19 testing for arriving passengers\n\nMeanwhile, another COVID-related health measure is being revived in Canada as the Trudeau government reinstated random COVID-19 testing for entering passengers at four major airports on July 19.\n\nThe country still requires passengers to be fully vaccinated to enter the country.\n\nThe random testing is being implemented for passengers coming to Calgary, Montreal, Toronto Pearson and Vancouver airports.\n\nAnalysts say that the move could put added strain on Canada’s stretched airline sector and decrease the demand for international travel to the nation.\n\nFlying visitors to Canada must download the ArriveCAN app 72 hours before departure. Once passengers clear customs, they will get a message sent to the app within 15 minutes if they have been randomly selected for testing. The said app will allow them to find a testing site and book an appointment.\n\nFor passengers connecting at the four airports to fly to another domestic airport, testing can be done at the final destination. If a traveler’s arrival test result is positive, he or she must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Even if the isolation requirement is shorter in a traveler’s province or territory, the federal government requires the full 10 days of isolation.\n\nRead more stories about COVID-19 vaccine deaths around the world at VaccineDeaths.com.\n\nWatch this video about the “plandemic” of the vaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the Anti-Disinformation channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nCanada’s health minister says you will NEVER be “fully vaccinated” against covid, no matter how many vaccines you take.\n\nVaccinated population accounts for 86% of Covid-19 deaths in Canada, but government continues to push boosters.\n\n4 Out of 5 COVID-19 deaths in Canada since mid-February are from the vaccinated population.\n\nTriple vaccinated individuals account for majority of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Canada this year.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\n\n\nHealth-InfoBase.Canada.ca\n\nRoutesOnline.com\n\nGlobalNews.ca\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "They never learn: British medical journals call for revival of pandemic restrictions which crippled UK’s economy\n\nEditors of the U.K.’s leading health publications British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Health Service Journal (HSJ) have called on the government to revive some of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions that crippled the country’s economy.\n\n“Now is the time to face the fact that the nation’s attempt to ‘live with COVID’ is the straw that is breaking the NHS’s [National Health Service] back,” said BMJ’s Dr. Kamran Abbasi and HSJ’s Alastair McLellan in a joint statement. “The heart of the problem is the failure to recognize that the pandemic is far from over and that a return to some of the measures taken in the past two years is needed.”\n\nSome of the measures they are referring to are the mask wearing in healthcare settings and on public transport, free testing scheme that is costing the government £2 billion ($2.41 billion) a month, work-from-home guidance and restrictions on social gatherings.\n\nDespite the alarming calls, leading experts believe Downing Street’s decision to remove all of the restrictions back in April was the right one.\n\nDaily COVID-19 hospital admissions have risen to a near 18-month high, with around 2,000 people currently being hospitalized every day. However, only a third of patients needing care are primarily ill with the virus. In other words, most of them are sick with something else.\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert from the University of East Anglia, said reinforcing the curbs now “is not going to achieve much” and may cause substantial disruption. “I think the balance of evidence is that the current wave has peaked,” he told MailOnline.\n\nAn administration adviser, who requested to be anonymous, said there is “no need for these health measures anymore.”\n\nDraconian restrictions only work when the public is not fully informed. Now, people are very much aware that the disease is essentially a cross between a cold and flu.\n\nMask mandates are returning despite being proven ineffective\n\nMask mandates are making a comeback in spite of massive shreds of evidence and studies proving that these are ineffective in curbing COVID-19 transmissions. (Related: Studies show how mask mandates, lockdowns, and COVID vaccines have failed to deliver.)\n\nAlthough COVID-19 cases in the country already declined, Germany is planning to reintroduce mask wearing. According to Marco Buschmann, the country’s justice minister, bringing back mandatory face coverings will be decided on soon.\n\nHe said both citizens and tourists would have to mask up in the fall and the mandate would be enforced throughout winter. The proposal for the mandate will be submitted to the German Parliament in September and expected to be implemented in October.\n\nIreland is also looking into reinstating mask mandates in preparation for a “possible emergency in winter.”\n\nMeanwhile, adviser for the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Dr. Colin Axon dismissed masks as mere “comfort blankets entrenching bad behavior.” He pointed out that masks do virtually nothing as the coronavirus particle is up to 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the mask.\n\nMoreover, a Danish study involving 6,000 participants concluded that “there was no statistically significant difference between those who wore masks and those who did not when it came to being infected by COVID-19.\n\nVisit HealthFreedom.news for more articles about the preservation of health freedom.\n\nWatch the below video to learn why mask mandates are ignoring science.\n\nThis video is from the NewsClips channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nFlorida expects record number of visitors in first spring break without COVID restrictions since 2019.\n\nMajor airlines to allow passengers banned for mask mandate violations back onboard.\n\nGermany to revive mask mandate in September despite declining COVID-19 cases.\n\nNY Supreme Court strikes down Hochul’s statewide mask mandate.\n\nSources include:\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nInfoWars.com\n\nTravelOffPath.com\n\nSummit.news\n\nSpectator.co.uk\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Biden tests positive for COVID despite getting FOUR doses of the clot shot\n\nPresident Joe Biden has tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted against the disease.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the development in a July 21 statement. She said the 79-year-old president is experiencing “very mild symptoms” and will isolate himself for the time being.\n\n“[Biden] will continue to carry out all of his duties fully … and work in isolation until he tests negative. Once he tests negative, he will return to in-person work.”\n\nAccording to Jean-Pierre, Biden returned a negative COVID-19 test result on July 19, two days before he contracted the pathogen. Given his advanced age, the president falls under the at-risk group in terms of developing severe illness.\n\nShe continued that the former vice president under the Obama administration had “been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone,” and will join planned meeting “via phone and Zoom.” The White House will also provide daily updates about Biden’s status, added Jean-Pierre.\n\n“Per standard protocol for any positive case at the White House, the White House Medical Unit will inform all close contacts of the president – including any members of Congress and any members of the press who interacted with [him].”\n\nBiden’s positive COVID-19 result followed that of White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, who caught the virus in June.\n\nA June 15 statement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirmed Fauci’s illness, stating that a rapid antigen test he took returned a positive result. Just like Biden, the 81-year-old Fauci had “mild symptoms” even though he was “fully vaccinated and “boosted twice.” (Related: Shroyer: Quadruple-vaxxed Fauci LIED about COVID vaccines protecting people from infection.)\n\nThe NIH statement added that the infectious disease expert had not been in close contact with Biden or other senior officials before testing positive.\n\nGovernment officials prove the vaccines do not work at all\n\nBiden and Fauci are just two examples of prominent government officials who proved that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective in preventing infection. Despite receiving four vaccine doses, the two officials of advanced age still caught COVID-19.\n\nTwo members of the legislative branch, both part of the Democratic Party, also contracted SARS-CoV-2 following their vaccination.\n\nBack in April, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi contracted COVID-19 after attending events where she was in close proximity to vaccinated colleagues. Her deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill confirmed the test result on social media.\n\n“After testing negative this week, Speaker Pelosi received a positive test result for COVID-19 and is currently asymptomatic. The speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, [and] encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and [tested] regularly,” Hammill wrote on April 7.\n\nPrior to this, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tested positive for COVID-19 in January. She was fully vaccinated and boosted, having received her booster dose during the 2021 fall season.\n\nAccording to a statement from her office at the time, Ocasio-Cortez was “experiencing symptoms and recovering at home.” The congresswoman also called on Americans to “get their boosters” and follow public health guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHead over to BadMedicine.news for more stories about government officials catching COVID-19 despite multiple vaccine doses.\n\nWatch this Italian doctor showing that most COVID-positive patients are vaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the Chinese taking down EVIL CCP channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nSens.

        "Pandemic of the vaccinated: NSW surveillance report confirms jabbed individuals are more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19\n\nThe latest surveillance report from New South Wales (NSW) in Australia has shown that people are 37 times more likely to be hospitalized with Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) if they are vaccinated than if they are not.\n\nAttempting to conceal the glaring fact, the NSW Ministry of Health (NSW Health) stated in the respiratory surveillance report summary of the epidemiological week ending July 9 that “COVID-19 vaccines are very effective in preventing the severe impacts of infections with the virus.” It also noted that over 95 percent of people aged 16 and over in NSW have received two doses of the vaccine, while more than 68 percent of the eligible for a third dose have already received it.\n\n“With such high vaccination coverage in the community, a greater proportion of people admitted to hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 are now vaccinated with two or three doses,” the report added.\n\nThe Expose slammed NSW Health for trying to conceal the truth. “It follows, as there is no more severe impact than hospitalization and death, their statement that the experimental injections are ‘very effective in preventing severe impacts’ is also a lie,” the news website pointed out.\n\nJoel Smalley, a pro bono COVID data analyst who examined the report deeper, wrote in his newsletter: “The data doesn’t lie. NSW Health data shows that ‘in the last seven weeks, you are 37 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 if you are vaccinated than if you are not.” (Related: Australia experiencing a pandemic of the fully vaccinated as cases surge among double-jabbed and boosted population.)\n\nThe unvaccinated are not dying at a higher rate either. Smalley noted that the risk multiplier is 0.94. “In other words, there is a six percent relative reduction in death in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated, a far cry from the 95 percent reduction originally claimed due to the fraudulent mis-categorization of the data,” he said.\n\nAccording to the NSW Health report, 45 were aged-care residents and only six were aged under 65 of the 95 deaths in the last week. All six had a “record of significant underlying health conditions that increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19,” four were triple-vaccinated and the other two were fully vaccinated.\n\nAustralia’s success story headed for a sad ending\n\nAustralia was once cited as exemplary in how it dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. At one point, the country was compared favorably to the U.S. for having similar demographics, but much lower death rates.\n\nBack in 2020, the public lamented that if the U.S. government had the same COVID death rate as Australia, about 900,000 lives would have been saved. Australia’s death rate was only one-tenth of America’s, putting the nation of 25 million people (with around 7,500 deaths) near the top of global rankings in the protection of life against COVID-19.\n\nBut now the country’s success story is headed for a sad ending.\n\nLast week, hospitals across the country are reaching record levels as numerous patients are being admitted with COVID-19. The highest number of COVID hospitalizations as of July 14 was recorded in Western Australia, whereas, Queensland is also expected to exceed its January peak in the next days.\n\nIn South Australia, admissions are nearing the January omicron peak, while NSW has more than 2,000 COVID patients last week for the first time since February.\n\nAll these happened after the vast majority of Australians got vaccinated.\n\nVisit VaccineDamage.news for more news related to the adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about the pandemic of the vaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the Puretrauma357 channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nGlobal pandemic of the vaccinated gets worse as more people take deadly shots.\n\nGovernment report: Almost 70 percent of recent COVID deaths, hospitalizations in Canada were among VAXXED people.\n\nData: Canada and Israel are suffering from a pandemic of the fully vaccinated.\n\nNew #BareShelvesBiden images show how fast things are going downhill – The ‘pandemic of the vaccinated’ is decimating the supply chain down.\n\nSources include:\n\nExpose-News.com\n\nHealth.NSW.gov.au\n\nMetatron.Substack.com\n\nTheGuardian.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "First person to receive compensation for wrongful death caused by AstraZeneca’s covid vaccine speaks out\n\nA 48-year-old rock singer named Zion was killed by AstraZeneca’s covid-19 vaccine and a string of misdiagnoses and medical malpractice in May of 2021. When all was said and done, neurosurgeons at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle linked Zion’s death back to the experimental vaccine. Zion received the vaccine and began suffering from migraines and occipital neuralgia just eight days later. He suffered a serious reaction that was not properly treated, that ultimately led to slurred speech, loss of balance, seizures and a brain bleed.\n\nHis fiancée, 38-year-old Vikki Spit, became the first person to receive compensation for wrongful death caused by the controversial covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWoman speaks out after fiancée is killed by covid vaccine, string of misdiagnoses, medical malpractice\n\nZion and Vikki had been together for 21 years and were set to be married. She was awarded £120,000 for the wrongful death, which is the maximum amount allowed by the country’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. This system was setup in 1979 and does not factor in today’s inflation, higher cost of medical care and lost wages. The system is operated by the National Health Services Business Services Authority. The amount awarded to Vikki did not fully cover the cost of lost wages and medical expenses incurred by the vaccine-induced death. She is fortunate to be compensated at all by a system that ignores the reality of vaccine injury and death. She should have also been compensated for a string of misdiagnoses and medical malpractice that followed the vaccine injury.\n\nVikki Spit is speaking out about the damages and the loss of her fiancée. She said the maximum settlement was not enough and should have been closer to £180,000.\n\n“I am still heartbroken by the sudden loss of my partner of 21 years, and alongside this emotional trauma, I have also been faced with financial hardship as a result of the loss of Zion’s contribution to household finances,” Vicki said. “There just isn’t the proper financial aid coming from the government to support those who have lost family to the vaccine.”\n\nNeurosurgeons solely blame covid vaccine, ignoring string of medical mistakes, timely organ procurement\n\nVicki also believes that her fiancée would have survived the vaccine injury had he received more prompt treatment for his severe migraines, brain bleed symptoms and seizures, which indicated a more and more serious issue was at hand. The hospital had time to screen Zion for artery dissection, blood clots and the like, but these treatments were not pursued in a timely fashion because doctors and paramedics were hesitant to admit Zion and investigate the vaccine injury. Once the hospital finally declared his death, organ donor services were able to procure Zion’s liver and kidneys so they could be used in three more lucrative lifesaving operations.\n\nIn these cases, it is rare for medical professionals to blame the vaccine industry, so there could be a more important trail of misdiagnoses and medical errors to conceal in this case and an even more powerful industry to protect. (Related: Black market for body parts exists in America… funeral home operator charged in criminal scheme.)\n\nZion began experiencing excruciating headaches just eight days after receiving the vaccine at the Penrith Auction Mart in Cumbria. Vikki called an ambulance on May 15 when Zion was unable to get out of bed on his own. She notified the paramedics that he had the AstraZeneca vaccine a week prior, but she was told that too much time had elapsed since the vaccine so it couldn’t be the cause. She was told that her fiancé only had a migraine. Refused proper medical treatment, Zion was sent home. Two days later, Zion began slurring his words and went into a seizure. Vicki called for an ambulance again.\n\nWhen Zion was finally admitted, he was unconscious and there was a tremendous amount of pressure inside his skull. The neurosurgeons removed a piece of his skull to assess the damage. They did not expect Zion to wake up, and if he did, they warned that he would be in a vegetative state. The neurosurgeons said the AstraZeneca vaccine caused a hemorrhage. He died at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary on May 19, 2021.\n\nJames Bell, medical negligence partner at Hodge Jones and Allen, commented on the matter: “While I am glad that Vikki has been able to receive some restitution for the hardship she has faced as a result of Zion’s death, the scheme simply isn’t fit for purpose,” he said. “Not only has the application process been lengthy and inefficient, but the compensation Vikki received fails to reflect and remediate the full economic impact of her fiancé’s death.”\n\nSources include:\n\nRevolver.news\n\nOrganHarvesting.news\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Researchers find monkeypox virus in patients’ saliva, semen and other bodily fluids\n\nResearchers in Spain have found high viral loads in the saliva, semen, urine and other samples taken from verified monkeypox patients. The study was published in the journal Eurosurveillance.\n\nMonkeypox is the most recent zoonotic disease to spread around the world. Over the past six months, there have been more than 9,000 reported cases of monkeypox globally.\n\nThe study authors mentioned the primary cases in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain have been for the most part discovered among men who have sex with other men.\n\nUp to now, the virus spreads mainly through direct contact with lesions on an infected patient’s skin. Contact with surfaces contaminated by these lesions can also transmit the virus. It’s still not clear whether monkeypox can be transmitted from person to person through bodily fluids like blood and semen. (Related: WHO investigating reports of monkeypox virus in semen)\n\nThe latest study investigated several biological samples from 12 patients with a verified case of monkeypox. At the period of their diagnosis, doctors discovered high viral DNA loads in the skin lesions of each patient.\n\nResearchers found that all 12 patients also had virus DNA in their saliva, with many having very high viral loads. Prior to this, only one study has discovered the virus in a single monkeypox patient’s saliva. They also discovered virus DNA in rectal (11 of 12 patients), nasal (10 of 12 patients), semen (seven of nine patients) and fecal (eight of 12 patients) samples from the monkeypox group.\n\n“A couple of previous studies had already shown the occasional presence of viral DNA in some samples and in some patients, but here we show that viral DNA is frequently present in various biological fluids, particularly saliva, during the acute phase of the disease, and up to 16 days after the onset of symptoms in one patient,” said the study’s lead researcher Aida Peiró of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).\n\nIn the next phase of their examination, researchers are planning to isolate infectious virus particles from the samples. They said higher viral loads in both saliva and semen indicate that they are infectious. This is in line with earlier reports that warn against kissing and having sex with monkeypox patients.\n\n“The results of our study contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of virus transmission, as well as the possible role of sexual transmission,” team leader Mikel Martínez said.\n\nCDC reports 2,323 confirmed monkeypox cases in America\n\nMeanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that there are now 2,323 lab-confirmed cases of monkeypox in the United States.\n\nThe virus has spread to 69 nations worldwide, including 63 that rarely or never had cases of monkeypox. As of Monday, July 18, more than 13,300 cases had been verified.\n\nThe virus, which is highly infectious and produces painful, itchy lesions, with sometimes-deadly complications, has now been identified in all but seven states. As of Monday, only Alaska, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming have zero confirmed cases.\n\nA small number of states have each reported a single case, while New York has more than 520 cases. According to reports, Washington, D.C. has the most cases per capita, “prompting public health officials to launch an aggressive vaccination campaign aimed at blanketing the most at-risk communities.”\n\n“I do think it’s important to say that U.S. surveillance numbers likely undercount cases,” CDC deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology Jennifer McQuiston stated during an interview with the American Medical Association’s “Moving Medicine” series.\n\nShe added that undercounts happen because “detection really depends on a lot of factors, including patients presenting for care, clinicians thinking about monkeypox when they’re seeing patients and then requesting and having access to diagnostic tests.”\n\nMcQuiston and other public health experts said cases are increasing daily in America.\n\n“Our outbreak curve is in a period of acceleration,” said McQuiston, who mentioned the same pattern is seen in the U.K., Spain and Portugal.\n\nMcQuiston further said the latest cases displayed day-to-day indicated the community spread and the CDC expects the numbers will continue to increase.\n\nFollow MonkeyPoxPanic.com for more news about the monkeypox outbreak.\n\nWatch the video below warning the public that the countdown to monkeypox outbreak has already started.\n\nThis video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com\n\nMore related stories:\n\nStudy reveals monkeypox virus was MANIPULATED in a lab and released intentionally to cause an outbreak.\n\nPRIDE month kicks off with MONKEYPOX outbreak in the homosexual community.\n\nBiden administration scrambles to get additional 144,000 monkeypox vaccines as demand outstrips supply.\n\nWHO says monkeypox outbreak unlikely to turn into next global pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, Bill Gates, Big Pharma and the WHO all participated in a monkeypox plandemic “simulation.”\n\nSources include:\n\nStudyFinds.org\n\nCDC.gov\n\nDeseret.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "COVID cases overwhelming New Zealand and Singapore despite strict mask mandates\n\nBelieve it or not, there are still some places in the world where people and their governments are fearful about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And in those places, COVID cases are soaring despite ultra-strict “safety” requirements like mandatory masking.\n\nTwo countries’ government tyranny in particular, New Zealand and Singapore, are seeing substantial increases in “positive” test results for COVID despite the continued imposition of highly oppressive government tyranny.\n\nAn infectious disease expert says mask and lockdown mandates in these two highly restrictive countries “don’t matter” because people are getting infected regardless – or perhaps they are getting infected because they are not living their lives normally and breathing freely the way God intended.\n\nIn Singapore, a country that prides itself on being a heartless police state with almost no freedom, cases of the Chinese Virus are surging despite mask mandates still being in place for two years and counting.\n\n“Singapore has never dropped its mask mandates,” said Australian National University infectious diseases professor Peter Collignon. “Masks are required indoors at all times.\n\nSingapore might think itself to be smart and superior with its muzzle mandates, but the data clearly show that it is doing far worse than other countries like Australia, which are mostly back to normal.\n\n“Australians aren’t wearing masks much at all,” Collignon added. “Let’s compare the data.”\n\nThat data, it turns out, shows that Australia is much healthier than Singapore, all things considered. Government tyranny, as we have all come to learn, is not the prescription for good health.\n\nDon’t fall for another round of mask mandates, America\n\nUnfortunately for Australia, there is a newfound push to reinstate mask mandates despite evidence from both New Zealand and Singapore showing that COVID face veils do absolutely nothing to prevent disease and actually increase the risk of illness or death.\n\nFor now, Aussies, including Aussie students, still have the option to not wear a mask in the classroom if they so choose. But pressure from certain areas of Asia seems to be wearing away at the freedom element that Australia has come to enjoy.\n\nIt seems as though both sides of the political aisle here in the United States are finally coming to the realization that masks do not work and were little more than a political stunt aimed at driving a wedge between Americans.\n\nHopefully, enough people in this country realize that, right or left, masks are a bad idea. And, hopefully, they will look at the data from New Zealand and Singapore before trying to once again join them in their mask insanity.\n\nAccording to New South Wales Premier Dom Perrottet, seasonal influenza – Australia is currently in its winter season – is a bigger threat than COVID. This means that things are basically back to normal and COVID is over.\n\n“At the moment, the current strand of influenza is more severe than the current strand of covid,” Perrottet told 2GB.\n\n“As we move through the next phase of the pandemic, we need to balance up the competing health issues.”\n\nAll available data points to the fact that COVID is basically done and gone. Whatever variants or subvariants remain are a non-issue, at least for people who did not destroy their immune systems with fake “vaccines.”\n\nIn Australia, mandatory isolation is still in place for people who test “positive” for COVID. For seven days, an Aussie must remain tucked away from society while the positive test result wanes, making the country an anomaly as most of the rest of the world is done with quarantine.\n\nMore of the latest news about the Chinese Virus can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources include:\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Mark Steyn: UK’s COVID vaccination program is a public health scandal\n\nAuthor and radio-television host Mark Steyn called the United Kingdom’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination program a scandal during the “Victims of the Vaccine” special episode of “The Mark Steyn Show.“\n\n“It’s a public policy scandal. It’s a public health scandal and the government has to completely change,” said Steyn, who was joined in the show by those injured and bereaved by the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines.\n\nSteyn, author of best-selling books “America Alone: The End of the World As We Know It” and “After America,” mentioned that the victims of the COVID-19 vaccines were spouses, parents and children.\n\n“There are those who lost their lives and others who are now chronically injured and can no longer work and are facing the prospect of selling their homes in order to pay medical bills,” he said.\n\nUK’s political establishment, media ignore COVID-19 vaccine victims\n\nThe jazz recording artist and human rights activist said the victims of COVID-19 vaccines, including their loved ones, have been shamefully treated by the state. He also slammed the British media for blatantly ignoring the stories of COVID-19 vaccine victims.\n\n“These people are the consequences of one of the worst public policies anywhere on the planet,” said Steyn, referring to his guests.\n\nGB News presenter Dan Wootton, who attended the show along with colleagues covering stories of COVID-19 vaccine victims, agreed with Steyn. According to Wootton, the most disgraceful and unforgivable thing done by the political establishment and the media was ignoring the people who suffered because of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAnother GB News presenter, Michelle Dewberry, stated that the way the government treated the COVID-19 vaccine victims and their families was a “national shame and disgrace.” Dewberry lamented the fact that these affected people were abandoned, abused and ostracized just for speaking up and telling the truth.\n\nSharing their ordeal during the show were Charlotte and Anne Wright, the wife and mother of clinical psychologist Stephen Wright – the first person to die from COVID-19 vaccine; Leanne Tomlin, whose stepmother Lucy Taberer died alone in the hospital; Claire Hibbs, who was diagnosed with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine; and Vikki Spit, the widow of musician partner Lord Zion – the first person in the U.K. to receive a COVID-19 vaccine damage payment.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines may claim more victims\n\nThe situation is about to get worse. Steyn noted that the U.S. is now injecting six-month-old babies, Australia’s New South Wales health minister is berating the double jabbed for being insufficiently enthusiastic about getting a third jab and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is saying that people must get jabbed every nine months to enjoy life as a citizen in a free society.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. government has finally admitted that the COVID-19 vaccines can kill and injure people and it has agreed to compensate people up to 120,000 pounds ($143,614.20) for the loss of their loved ones or the loss of their livelihood. Recent data shows that 75 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the U.K. were triple vaccinated.\n\nMember of Parliament (MP) Sir Christopher Chope also joined the show. He related that his colleagues are beginning to wake up and see what is really happening. (Related: British MP: Scale of COVID vaccine damage a NIGHTMARE.)\n\nAccording to Chope, he now has 12 sponsors and cross-party support for his private member’s bill about the COVID-19 vaccine damage issue.

        "Canadian legal group blasts Alberta magistrate who ruled that doctors can require COVID vaccination before organ transplants\n\nA legal advocacy group in Canada denounced a magistrate in Alberta province who ruled that doctors can require Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination before proceeding with organ transplants.\n\nIn a statement, the Alberta-based Justice Center for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) blasted the ruling by Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench Justice R. Paul Belzil. JCCF lawyer and legal counsel Allison Pejovic called Belzil’s July 12 decision “deeply disappointing.” She represented plaintiff Sheila Annette Lewis, 57, who filed a complaint after being informed in March 2021 that unless she got the COVID-19 vaccine, she would be removed from the organ transplant waitlist.\n\nAccording to Pejovic, Alberta Health Services (AHS) has an obligation to “ensure that doctors that are carrying out their duties within the provincially funded transplant program” are upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (CCRF). “It seems that the court has effectively ruled that AHS can contract out of its [CCRF] obligations,” noted the JCCF lawyer.\n\nLewis, who was diagnosed with a degenerative disease, wrote in her legal affidavit that getting the vaccine “offends [her] conscience.”\n\n“I ought to have the choice about what goes into my body, and a lifesaving treatment cannot be denied to me because I chose not to take an experimental treatment for a condition,” she noted. The plaintiff also asked the court to uphold her right to conscience, bodily autonomy and freedom to choose without coercion – all protected by the CCRF.\n\nBut according to the JCCF, Belzil ruled that the CCRF does not apply to the decision of the organ transplant team funded by AHS. “The proposed AHS policy, which has not been completed, mirrors the recommendations of the treating physicians [who] are exercising clinical judgment,” he wrote in his decision. (Related: Canadian judge rules denying organ transplants to unvaxxed patients is legal.)\n\nJCCF wrote in the statement that it will “review the decision and determine whether to file an appeal.”\n\nExperts attest to the ineffectiveness of vaccines\n\nThe physicians, and AHS at large, reportedly required organ transplant surgery candidates to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before undergoing the operation. However, the legal advocacy group pointed out that this compulsory vaccination policy for transplant patients was not put in writing. Lewis was only informed of the vaccine mandate through her doctors.\n\nGiven this, Pejovic noted that AHS and the plaintiff’s physicians “either made the policies, were aware of the policies, or enforced the policies.”\n\nTo bolster her case, Lewis also filed expert reports from immunologists Drs. Bonnie Mallard and Byram Bridle. Their reports, alongside oral testimonies, “illustrated that the COVID-19 vaccines are still in clinical trials.” The two also mentioned that peer-reviewed research and raw scientific data leaned toward skepticism of how “safe and effective” the mRNA vaccines are.\n\nFurthermore, the plaintiff also filed an expert report from surgeon Dr. Benjamin Turner in support of her legal affidavit. Turner, who has a master’s degree in health care ethics, testified that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination for Lewis was so small – that requiring her to get injected with the vaccine before undergoing the organ transplant was “unethical.”\n\nBelzil nevertheless “declined to address the scientific and ethical arguments advanced” as he determined that the CCRF “did not apply to the treating physicians.”\n\nThe Alberta justice noted that while the patient was indeed the sole arbiter of what she puts into her own body, no one has an inherent right to an organ transplant.\n\n“The proposition that treating physicians exercising clinical judgment would be subject to the Charter would result in medical chaos, with patients seeking endless judicial review of clinical treatment decisions.”\n\nVisit MedicalFascism.news for more stories about unvaccinated organ transplant candidates being discriminated upon.\n\nWatch this NBC report about an unvaccinated man in Boston being denied a heart transplant.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nColorado hospital system demands that all organ transplant recipients first destroy their own organs with covid spike protein vaccines before receiving new organs from donors.\n\nTexas man with natural immunity DIES after being forced to take COVID-19 vaccine while awaiting lung transplant.\n\nTom Renz slams medical violence being committed against unvaccinated organ transplant patients – Brighteon.TV.\n\nCanadian court rules it was legal to deny unvaccinated person organ transplant.\n\nHospitals discriminating against unvaccinated organ transplant candidates.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nJCCF.ca\n\nBreitbart.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Josh Yoder tells Dr. Bryan Ardis: Issue of COVID vaccine injuries is going to get worse – Brighteon.TV\n\nUS Freedom Flyers co-founder Josh Yoder believes the issue about Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine injuries is going to get worse.\n\n“This is an issue that we don’t see going away. I believe it’s only going to get worse. And I think we all really need to band together all the people in the medical community, organize organizations like ours and we need to make sure we’re all pulling in the same direction to get these people help,” Yoder told Dr. Bryan Ardis during the July 13 episode of “The Dr. Ardis Show” on Brighteon.TV.\n\nYoder said the vaccine injuries are “absolutely atrocious” not only for crew members from the airline industry but also for the passengers.\n\nThe veteran airline pilot noted that many people have come forward to US Freedom Flyers and some are not even associated with the airline industry.\n\n“There is a giant cover-up happening. Concerned people must expose it and do something about it because it is going to end in catastrophe for a lot of people,” he said.\n\nYoder related that the US Freedom Flyers started by pushing back for personal rights and freedoms, standing up against the vaccine mandates and supporting acceptance of religious and medical exemptions. Now, the organization is focused on the accountability side of the matter.\n\nFAA allowed airlines to enforce COVID vaccine mandates without safety studies\n\nThe pilot slammed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for allowing the airlines to enforce the COVID vaccine mandate without long-term safety studies, which he said is something that has never happened before in the history of the FAA.\n\nAccording to Yoder, the FAA just allowed the airlines to push pilots into taking an experimental shot without knowing what the side effects are going to be.\n\n“It was obviously a politically driven decision. So what we’re going to do now is hold these people accountable. We absolutely have to stop this at the FAA level. And the reason that’s important is because many civil aviation authorities around the world base their rules, policies and procedures off of what the FAA is doing in the United States,” Yoder said.\n\nThe US Freedom Flyers co-founder added that by targeting a specific regulatory agency, people can make a change by proving that these vaccines are bad for pilots, which will also prove that it is bad for other people. He believes that this is going to have ripple effects.\n\nYoder asked the help of the American public, saying that this is not something they can do on their own. “This is going to make a fundamental difference, especially when it comes to regulations and the type of things within transportation that directly affect people’s safety.”\n\nHe said pilots have lost their lives in the flight deck and that this is something the airline industry has been quiet about. (Related: After vaccines killed so many, U.S. airlines have run out of pilots and are now canceling flights.)\n\n“They don’t care about this because the companies and the regulatory organizations that are supposed to oversee flight safety and transportation safety have completely dropped the ball here and they’re liable,” Yoder explained.\n\nBut the number one issue here, according to Yoder, is freedom or the loss of it.\n\nArdis agreed, noting that Americans should be fighting for freedom of choice. “God’s greatest gift to humanity is the freedom to make choices and anyone who tries to strip that from a person is anti-God,” Ardis said.\n\nThe CEO of ArdisLabs stressed that freedom of choice is what Americans should be fighting for regardless of what their personal issues are.\n\nWatch the July 13 episode of “The Dr. Ardis Show” below. “The Dr. Ardis Show” airs every Wednesday at 10-11 a.m. and every Saturday at 11-12 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nDr. Jane Ruby: Airline pilots were offered incentives to get COVID-19 vaccine – Brighteon.TV.\n\nPilots fear for safety of passengers as airlines continue to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandate – Brighteon.TV.\n\nUnited Airlines pilot who refused to take COVID vaccine stuck on unpaid leave.\n\nSources include:\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nTheDrArdisShow.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "\n\nOriginally published on www.childrenshealthdefense.org by Megan Redshaw\n\nVAERS data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 1,350,950 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID-19 vaccines, including 29,635 deaths and 246,676 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 15, 2022\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today released new data showing a total of 1,350,950 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 15, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). That's an increase of 9,342 adverse events over the previous week.\n\nVAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 29,635 reports of deaths -- an increase of 175 over the previous week -- and 246,676 serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period -- up 3,210 compared with the previous week.\n\nOf the 29,635 reported deaths, 19,150 cases are attributed to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, 7,850 cases to Moderna and 2,577 cases to Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nExcluding \"foreign reports\" to VAERS, 845,611 adverse events, including 13,705 deaths and 86,131 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 15, 2022.\n\nForeign reports are reports foreign subsidiaries send to U.S. vaccine manufacturers. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product's labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 13,705 U.S. deaths reported as of July 15, 7% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 15% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 54% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 599 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered as of July 13, including 354 million doses of Pfizer, 226 million doses of Moderna and 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nGRAPH 1\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 15, 2022, for 6-month-olds to 5-year-olds show:\n\nThe CDC uses a narrowed case definition of \"myocarditis,\" which excludes cases of cardiac arrest, ischemic strokes and deaths due to heart problems that occur before one has the chance to go to the emergency department.\n\n14 reports of blood clotting disorders.\n\n20 reports of seizures.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 15, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 15, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 15, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:\n\nChildren's Health Defense (CHD) asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nBiden: 'You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations'\n\nThe White House on Thursday announced President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 despite having received two primary series vaccine doses and two booster shots.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden's symptoms are \"mild\" and he has begun taking Pfizer's Paxlovid, which is authorized for the treatment of \"mild-to-moderate COVID-19\" and is associated with rebound COVID-19.\n\nClinical trials for the drug did not include people who, like Biden, received a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen asked during the press briefing where Biden contracted COVID-19, Jean-Pierre said it doesn't matter -- the most important thing is that he was fully vaccinated and double boosted.\n\nAfter the announcement, a video quickly resurfaced with previous remarks Biden made during a CNN town hall a year ago to the day he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n\"You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,\" Biden said during the event.\n\nGREG PRICE TWEET\n\n1 in 5,000 affected by severe adverse reaction to COVID shots in Germany\n\nThe German Federal Ministry of Health on Wednesday admitted 1 of every 5,000 COVID-19 vaccinations cause \"serious side effects.\"\n\nAlthough likely an \"underestimation\" due to voluntary reporting, the admission implies almost 300,000 Americans and Europeans have experienced a severe adverse event after receiving a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.\n\nThe figure came from a Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) safety report summarizing suspected cases of side effects and vaccination complications between Dec. 27, 2020, when Germany launched its vaccination campaign, and March 31, 2022.\n\nDuring that time, 172,062,925 vaccinations were administered in Germany -- of those, 17.1% were Spikevax, 7.4% were AstraZeneca, 2.1% were Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and 0.1% were Novavax.\n\nDuring the same time period, PEI received 296,233 reports of suspected side effects. The reporting rate was 1.7 per 1,000 vaccine doses for all vaccines combined and 0.2 serious reaction reports per 1,000 doses.\n\nAccording to PEI, the reported rate of frequent adverse reactions include myocarditis (1.3 cases per 100,000 people), tachycardia (8.19 cases) and lymphadenopathy (11.52 cases).\n\nApproximately 1% (2,810) of cases resulted in death, and 4% of cases reported permanent damage. A total of 5,862 suspected adverse reactions were reported in children and adolescents.\n\nCardiologist supports Djokovic's stance against COVID vaccine\n\nCardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough defended tennis player Novak Djokovic's stance against receiving a COVID-19 vaccine amid claims mRNA vaccines can cause heart damage, reported Tennis World USA.\n\nPer U.S. vaccine laws, foreigners must show proof of vaccination upon entering the country. Djokovic, 35, hasn't been vaccinated against COVID-19 and may miss out on the US Open because of his vaccination status.\n\n\"The COVID-19 vaccines, all of them, in the medical literature, there are over 200 papers, they all cause heart damage and that is the last thing that an athlete can possibly risk,\" McCullough said.\n\n\"Heart damage can lead to heart failure or tragically, sudden death. He has clearly made the right choice and the vaccine injuries extend beyond the heart. There can be damage to the skeletal muscle, the nerves, the brain, so much of what an elite tennis player is, is at risk when they take a COVID-19 vaccine.\"\n\nDjokovic, who recently won Wimbledon, confirmed he does not plan on getting a COVID-19 vaccine before the US Open, nor will he force his entry into the U.S.\n\nCDC signs off on Novavax despite concerning side effects\n\nAdvisors to the CDC on Tuesday unanimously recommended Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, despite a problematic surfactant polysorbate 80 and never-before-approved nanoparticulate adjuvant contained in the vaccine called Matrix-M.\n\nThe media portrays the Novavax injection as a \"game changer\" in comparison to the mRNA and adenovirus-vectored gene therapy shots, claiming it should be \"reassuring to those who are hesitant.\"\n\nTo further entice the unvaccinated to receive COVID-19 vaccines, headlines feature the misleading claim that Novavax's jab is \"free of side effects.\"\n\nYet, a day after the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization for Novavax, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) made its own announcement, stating it was updating its product information for the Novavax COVID-19 shot to disclose \"new\" side effects.\n\nThe EMA's list of side effects included \"severe allergic reaction [anaphylaxis] and unusual or decreased feeling in the skin\" (called paresthesia and hypoesthesia, respectively).\n\nThe EMA also said it is assessing myocarditis and pericarditis as Novavax side effects -- safety signals that also were on display in the FDA's briefing document.\n\n42% of women report heavier menstrual bleeding after COVID shots\n\nIn the largest study of its kind to date, 42% of women who were menstruating regularly reported breakthrough bleeding after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe survey sample included 39,129 currently and formerly menstruating participants between the ages of 18 and 80 years old who were fully vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, J&J, Novavax or AstraZeneca vaccines and had not previously had COVID-19.\n\nAmong participants who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones and 66% of postmenopausal women reported breakthrough bleeding.\n\nAmong nonmenstruating, premenopausal women on hormonal treatments, 65.7% experienced breakthrough bleeding after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and 66.0% of postmenopausal respondents reported breakthrough bleeding.\n\nResearchers said the combination of a reproductive history that includes being pregnant but not giving birth in the past is associated with the highest risk of heavier flow, although having been pregnant and giving birth was also associated with a heavier flow."

        "\n\nOriginally published on www.childrenshealthdefense.org by Megan Redshaw\n\nVAERS data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 1,341,608 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID-19 vaccines, including 29,460 deaths and 243,466 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today released new data showing a total of 1,341,608 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). That's an increase of 12,473 adverse events over the previous week.\n\nVAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 29,460 reports of deaths -- an increase of 187 over the previous week -- and 243,466 serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period -- up 1,566 compared with the previous week.\n\nOf the 29,460 reported deaths, 19,066 cases are attributed to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, 7,770 cases to Moderna and 2,563 cases to Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nExcluding \"foreign reports\" to VAERS, 842,576 adverse events, including 13,604 deaths and 85,731 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022.\n\nForeign reports are reports foreign subsidiaries send to U.S. vaccine manufacturers. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product's labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 13,604 U.S. deaths reported as of July 8, 15% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 19% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 58% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 597 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered as of July 6, including 353 million doses of Pfizer, 225 million doses of Moderna and 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 6-month-olds to 5-year-olds show:\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:\n\nChildren's Health Defense (CHD) asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nFDA authorizes Novavax COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThe FDA on Wednesday granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for adults 18 and over.\n\nThe EUA is for a two-dose primary series targeting the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus -- limiting the vaccine's use, as about two-thirds of Americans already have completed a primary series of either the Pfizer, Moderna or J&J vaccines.\n\nThe CDC still needs to sign off on the Novavax vaccine before pharmacies and other healthcare providers can start administering the product.\n\nThe Biden administration on Monday announced a deal with Novavax to purchase 3.2 million doses of the vaccine contingent on both the FDA and CDC signing off on the new shot.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine relies on a protein-based technology used for decades, leading some media outlets to portray it as a \"traditional\" vaccine compared with other COVID-19 vaccines that use newer technologies -- which might make it appeal to unvaccinated people who are allergic to components of the mRNA vaccines, or just skeptical of the newer technologies.\n\nBut according to Dr. Meryl Nass, an internist with a special interest in vaccine-induced illnesses, chronic fatigue syndrome and toxicology, the media's portrayal of Novavax as a more traditional vaccine is not accurate.\n\nNass, a member of the CHD scientific advisory committee, pointed out that the Novavax shot contains a novel adjuvant, Matrix-M, \"so it is not really an old-fashioned shot.\"\n\nNass raised safety concerns specific to the adjuvant, while others voiced concerns about Novavax being linked to heart inflammation and blood clots, and the fact that the vaccine was designed for use against the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 -- not the Omicron variants that are dominant today.\n\nFDA quietly grants full approval of Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine for adolescents\n\nIn a move CHD President Mary Holland called \"head-spinning,\" the FDA on July 10 granted full approval of Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 15 years old.\n\nIn an FDA press release, the agency said full approval of Comirnaty follows a \"rigorous analysis and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data,\" and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine \"has been, and will continue to be authorized for emergency use in this age group since May 2021.\"\n\nPfizer's press release announcing the approval said the Comirnaty vaccine has been available under EUA since May 2021 for the adolescent age group.\n\nYet, Comirnaty is not available in the U.S for any age group and is not the same formula as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine currently authorized under EUA and being distributed as a \"fully approved\" vaccine.\n\nLatest Pfizer data dump reveals more vaccine injuries, deaths\n\nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine documents released in July by the FDA reveal three more reports of deaths among vaccine trial participants and further instances of Pfizer downplaying serious adverse events sustained by participants and listing the injuries as \"not related\" to the vaccine.\n\nOf the approximately 80,000 pages released this month, a 3,611-page \"confidential\" document contains information about clinical trial participants who died, sustained adverse events during the trial or contracted COVID-19 during the trial.\n\nIn all three cases of reported deaths, the investigator ruled out the possibility that the deaths were related to Pfizer's vaccines.\n\nOne instance pertains to a 56-year-old white female who suffered cardiac arrest within two months of her second Pfizer dose. The second reported death involves a 60-year-old white male who received one dose of the vaccine and died within three days of atherosclerotic disease. The participant's death was attributed to a \"suspected\" cause, while the possibility that it was vaccine-related in any way was dismissed.\n\nThe third death was listed under the section in the document where trial participants withdrew. A 72-year-old man developed vasovagal syncope after receiving the vaccine, was transferred to the intensive care unit and then withdrawn from the study. He died three days after being withdrawn.\n\nAccording to the documents, investigators attributed the vaccine to serious adverse events in four cases, however, Pfizer disagreed with the investigators' conclusions in three out of the four cases.\n\nFDA colluded with Moderna to bypass COVID vaccine safety standards\n\nAccording to Alexandra Latypova, an ex-pharmaceutical industry executive, documents obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine suggest the FDA and Moderna colluded to bypass regulatory and scientific standards used to ensure products are safe.\n\nAfter analyzing 699 pages of studies and test results \"supposedly used by the FDA to clear Moderna's mRNA platform-based mRNA-1273, or Spikevax,\" Latypova told The Defender she believes U.S. health agencies are lying to the public on behalf of vaccine manufacturers and subverting the regulatory and scientific standards of drug safety testing.\n\n\"They accepted fraudulent test designs, substitutions of test articles, glaring omissions and whitewashing of serious signs of health damage by the product, then lied to the public on behalf of the manufacturers,\" she said.\n\nLatypova disclosed six findings from her assessment of Moderna's documents raising serious questions about the safety and efficacy of the company's COVID-19 vaccine, as well as conflicts of interests that she says allowed Moderna to sidestep drug development standards.\n\nTennis champ Djokovic has 'no plans' to get vaccinated as US Open tournament nears\n\nTennis champion Novak Djokovic, who last weekend won his fourth straight title at Wimbledon, said he has no plans to get vaccinated in order to bypass restrictions to enter the U.S. in August for the US Open.\n\nDjokovic said he doesn't think an exemption is \"realistically possible.\" It's just a matter of whether or not the U.S. removes the requirement in time for him to attend the tournament, he said.\n\nU.S. COVID-19 vaccination requirements for foreigners bar Djokovic's entry into the country where he would normally compete at the US Open.\n\nSerbia's Djokovic, 35, has been dominant at Wimbledon for the past couple of years, according to Tennis World USA. He is regarded by some as the world's greatest tennis player ever.\n\nPhillies catcher will miss two-game series in Canada rather than comply with vaccine mandate\n\nPhillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said he refuses to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even it if means missing Philadelphia's two-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays this week.\n\nPlayers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 are not allowed to enter Canada due to the country's restrictions. In addition, players will not be paid for the games they miss as part of Major League Baseball's new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nRealmuto will lose about $262,000 for missing the series, which he called \"a little bit of money,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Realmuto signed a five-year, $115.5 million contract with the Phillies in January 2021.\n\nRealmuto said he is a 31-year-old professional athlete who had COVID-19 several times with mild symptoms. After speaking with doctors, he didn't think he needed it and wasn't going to get vaccinated just because he was told to."

        "The discovery of athletes developing myocarditis after battling a COVID-19 infection previously forced several professional and collegiate sports leagues to cancel their major events and seasons. But latest scientific data on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease has shed light on how the incidence of heart inflammation among athletes was lower than first thought.\n\nNew Guidance\n\nThe American College of Cardiology (ACC) released new guidelines for athletes who battled COVID-19 on Tuesday, after two years of research. The new guidance contained a cohesive plan for athletes and weekend warriors attempting to return to their intensive routines and activities.\n\nBased on the new guidelines, asymptomatic athletes are encouraged to abstain from training for three days to ensure that they won’t develop symptoms. Athletes with mild but non-cardiopulmonary symptoms should wait for the symptoms to resolve before returning to their exercise training.\n\nMeanwhile, athletes with cardiopulmonary symptoms, such as chest pain, palpitations, and syncope, are strongly recommended to defer exercise training for three to six months. They should also complete self-isolation, wait for their symptoms to go away, and subject themselves to cardiac testing for further evaluation.\n\nExperts said re-introduction of exercise to athletes who survived COVID-19 should be gradual. They should start with small and less intense exercise before increasing frequency, duration, and intensity. This would help their bodies adapt to the changes in their routines brought about by the infection.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThe ACC said that the guidelines are still subject to change, especially when further understanding of the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 becomes available. There is a need to continue studying the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in athletes to determine how long recovery takes after the symptoms disappear. Moreover, it is crucial to find the risks and benefits of exercise resumption for athletes after an infection.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, doctors were doing “very rigorous testing searching for myocarditis,” believing that the incidence of the condition “was going to be much higher,” Cleveland Clinic Sports Cardiology Center co-director Dr. Tamanna Singh, who was not involved in the new guidance, told ABC News.\n\nThanks to further research on the matter, scientists were able to determine that the rate of myocarditis development in athletes was “very low” at around “0.6 to 0.7%.” Despite this, University of Michigan cardiologist and echocardiographer Dr. Nicole Bhave, a co-chair on the committee that worked on the new guidance, said patients with COVID myocarditis must receive proper treatment because though the complication may be rare, it could get serious fast."

        "Researchers might have already found an answer to questions about the lingering cognitive issues in long COVID patients.\n\nScientists said in a study published last Friday that an overstimulated immune system could be the one responsible for the brain fog and all other cognitive problems post-COVID syndrome patients are experiencing, ABC News reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Role Of Inflammation\n\nWhen the immune system is overstimulated, persistent cognitive problems could occur. The overstimulation is believed to be triggered by the ongoing vascular injury and repair caused by the changes and inflammation that the COVID-19 infection brought with it.\n\nThe research team found an “inflammatory signature” in the cerebrospinal fluid of the 13 study participants who still had lingering cognitive problems 10 months after battling the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe levels of the two inflammatory markers in the spinal fluid were higher in patients experiencing persistent cognitive issues after their bout with mild COVID-19. The levels were lower in patients without symptoms during the infective stage of the disease.\n\nAside from the C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A inflammatory markers in the spinal fluid, researchers also noticed a spike in the vascular endothelial growth factor markers, suggesting that there was healing and repair in response to the inflammation.\n\n“Many millions of people experience persistent cognitive issues after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can impact even young, healthy adults who had a mild case of COVID,” lead researcher Dr. Joanna Hellmuth, of the University of California, San Francisco, said.\n\n“However, there are not yet effective laboratory tests or treatments for COVID-associated cognitive changes, in part, because we do not understand the underlying biology,” she continued.\n\nImplications Of The Study\n\nUnfortunately, the study they conducted was very small. Hellmuth acknowledged this in an interview with MedPage Today. But if the findings were true, the team’s research could help establish what needs to be done to address the lingering cognitive issues brought about by COVID-19.\n\n“This is an important observation. It suggests vascular injury and repair in the brain may set up the inflammation,” said Dr. Avindra Nath, the clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, who was not part of the study.\n\nNath suggested that a clinical trial could help move treatment forward while shedding light on what is causing the post-COVID symptoms affecting the brain.\n\nHe added that now is the perfect time to move forward with trials and studies focusing on the post-COVID cognitive problems because billions of people could be affected.\n\n“People say you need to know the mechanism behind this,\" Nath said. \"And I would say, yes, that's absolutely true: you don't want to rush because you don't want to cause harm. But ... [y]ou’ve got billions of people infected. It takes years to figure out mechanisms. Can we really afford to wait that long?” Nath said.\n\nThe preliminary work of Hellmuth’s team was presented at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting over the weekend."

        "Seven in ten long COVID patients suffer concentration and memory problems several months after their bout with SARS-CoV-2, new research from the University of Cambridge has found.\n\nLong COVID Symptoms\n\nThere has been a growing effort to map out and understand the lingering symptoms present in long COVID-19 patients. The latest points to two symptoms that many patients struggle with several months after the initial onset of the coronavirus infection — memory and concentration problems.\n\nUniversity of Cambridge researchers reported last week that several long COVID sufferers experience brain fog and concentration problems. In a study they conducted, 78% of the 181 respondents reported having a hard time concentrating. Other participants also reported other issues.\n\nAbout 69% of the respondents complained about experiencing brain fog or confusion. On the other hand, 68% reported forgetfulness, while 60% had difficulty finding the right words when they were talking.\n\nHalf of the participants said they had a hard time finding professionals who would take their self-reported symptoms seriously since most cognitive issues that come from COVID-19 are not given that much attention by the medical community.\n\nTo assess the symptoms, the participants were subjected to several tasks designed to evaluate their decision-making and memory. The team found that the results were consistent with memory problems, and the symptoms were more pronounced in patients who dealt with more severe symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nImplications Of The Study\n\nAmong the total number of participants, 75% said their long COVID symptoms made them unable to work. Since the issues affected their memory and concentration, they struggled with performing their tasks efficiently.\n\nAccording to the researchers, their study showed what could be a worrying impact on the society’s workforce amid the pandemic. They anticipated a “long tail” of workforce illness to cause problems should the medical community and governments continue to turn a blind eye to long COVID and its effects.\n\n“Long COVID has received very little attention politically or medically. It urgently needs to be taken more seriously, and cognitive issues are an important part of this. When politicians talk about ‘Living with COVID’ – that is, unmitigated infection, this is something they ignore. The impact on the working population could be huge,” said senior author Dr. Lucy Cheke, a researcher in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Psychology.\n\nThe team will move forward with the next phase of their study to further understand the cognitive effects of COVID-19 in adults. They are currently recruiting individuals for two new studies.\n\nCOVID and Mental Health\n\nA study published in The Lancet Public Health journal early last week focused on the long-term effects of the coronavirus disease on mental health. The team found that bedridden patients were at high risk for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.\n\nThe scientists called for “increased vigilance of adverse mental health development” among severe COVID-19 patients to better address the long-term effects of the disease on mental health.\n\nMeanwhile, experts from the U.K. emphasized in February that vaccination was the key to preventing the incidence of long COVID. They said that based on their review of 15 studies, vaccinated people were less likely to develop long COVID than unvaccinated people."

        "The human body is very much capable of giving signals when it becomes incapable of handling common viral diseases and other mild conditions. It gives warnings when the immune system is weak and not that efficient in protecting against pathogens. Knowing such warnings or signs can help you address a problem before it blows out of proportion.\n\nBelow is a list of the top three tell-tale signs of a weak immune system, courtesy of CNBC.\n\nGetting Sick Frequently\n\nIf you get sick more often and take longer than usual to recover, your immune system must be working at a sluggish rate. Sneezes and sniffles are very common during the cold season, but having them more often than usual, especially when it’s not even winter, should tell you that something is wrong with your first line of defense against pathogens.\n\nExperiencing Constant Stress\n\nA minimal level of stress is undeniably helpful for overall wellness. Acute stressors like a traffic jam can help boost your immune system in the short term. But if you are getting stressed out and experiencing chronic stress, there must be something wrong with your immune system. Such a condition can lead you to suffer increased infections and recover poorly from diseases.\n\nHaving Cold Sores And Shingles Often\n\nCold sores and shingles are caused by the herpes virus family, and they tend to have similar-appearing rashes. The herpes virus can enter a dormant state in the body, but it can be reactivated and start replicating when the immune system is subject to stress. Hence, having frequent reactivations would indicate that the immune system is weak.\n\nIf you have one or all three, it’s time for you to address the elephant in the room and boost your immune system for better protection, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Internal medicine physician Dr. Michael E. Ford, MD, has shared simple tips to strengthen the immune system via the New York-Presbyterian Hospital’s website.\n\nAerobic Exercise\n\nRegular exercise has been linked to having a better immune system, and it is also said to reduce stress and help relieve depression. According to Ford, people who engage in aerobic exercises daily get sick less than people who don’t. That’s because the activity brings in several positive changes to the body. It improves cardiovascular health, lowers blood pressure, and helps regulate body weight.\n\nBalanced Diet\n\nFord suggested having a “well-rounded, balanced diet” packed with vegetables, lean meats and healthy fats. He said that this would help improve the body’s defenses against infections. Instead of taking probiotic supplements, he also recommended adding yogurt and fermented foods to the diet will have a much better effect on the body.\n\nEnough Sleep\n\nEnough sleep does wonders for the body. Sleep is more than just a state of rest since it also involves the process of revitalization. Ford said everyone should aim for six to eight hours of sleep per night so that “the whole system of the body is revitalized.” Sticking to a bedtime routine can help promote a good sleeping pattern, free from disruptions."

        "As the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and infect people across the globe, health experts pointed out why the vaccine for the new variant is taking so long to arrive.\n\nTwo years into the pandemic, it’s become clear that one of its biggest challenges is the constant virus mutation that forces vaccine manufacturers to come up and release new boosters.\n\nThe trouble is, while more than 75% of new U.S. cases have been linked to the current BA.5 omicron variant, the COVID-19 booster shots that will target that and the BA.4 variant won’t be ready until fall. By then, an entirely new coronavirus strain might already be wreaking havoc, according to experts.\n\nThis already happened with the booster for the original BA.1 omicron variant that took a while before reaching vaccine trials, despite the actual variant largely vanishing from the actual population. To that end, health experts are warning that this approach is unsustainable and a stark contrast to how fast the turnaround time was for the original COVID-19 mRNA vaccines two years ago.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, a precision medicine expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, noted that the country would reach 100% BA.5 in just a matter of weeks. He added that there’s no doubt more mutated variants lie ahead, whether they’re from the same omicron family or a new lineage altogether.\n\n“Should we wait for a BA.5 booster? That will take months, and it should be noted it took more than 7 months for the omicron BA.1 booster to be tested, a delay that is exceedingly long and unacceptable relative to the timing of validation and production of the original vaccines in 10 months during 2020,” Dr. Topol added.\n\nIn theory, the technology behind mRNA vaccines should make it easy to adjust boosters once an emerging Covid strain has been genetically sequenced. In the meantime, the efficacy of the BA.1-based COVID-19 boosters against BA.4 and BA.5 remain questionable.\n\nTo help curb the rising cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also taken other measures to combat COVID, including authorizing vaccines for infants and approving the Novavax vaccine, a traditional, non-mRNA vaccine similar to a flu shot."

        "Existing COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are not enough to secure long-term protection from the new omicron variants, a new study has found.\n\nSponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and led by the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium, researchers conducted a study on the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the different COVID vaccine-and-booster combinations.\n\nThe team did a “mix and match” clinical trial wherein participating adults were administered boosters after completing a primary COVID-19 vaccination series. Regardless of the combinations, the researchers measured the immune responses yielded in every setup.\n\nPrevious results reported in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that all combinations led to increased neutralizing antibody levels in the recipients.\n\nFor the new analysis, the team evaluated how the neutralizing antibodies fared against the different omicron sub-lineages, including BA.1, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5.\n\nPublished in Cell Reports Medicine this week, the findings of the more recent analysis determined that the antibody levels of the group that received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and booster were low.\n\nOn the other hand, combinations that utilized Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and boosters triggered high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the omicron BA.1 sub-lineage.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that the neutralizing antibodies substantially decreased in three months in all group combinations. The antibody levels dropped 2.4 to 5.3-fold three months after the booster shot.\n\n“We assess the magnitude and short-term durability of neutralizing antibodies after homologous and heterologous boosting with mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccines. All prime-boost combinations substantially increase the neutralization titers to omicron, although the boosted titers decline rapidly within 2 months from the peak response compared with boosted titers against the prototypic D614G variant,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe omicron BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineages were 1.5 and 2.5 times less susceptible to neutralization. This reflected the real-world reports about the newer strains. BA.5 is currently the dominant strain in the U.S.\n\n“These results have implications for boosting requirements to protect against omicron and future variants of SARS-CoV-2,” the team indicated in their study.\n\nThe data could also be used for making informed decisions about future vaccine schedule recommendations and the need for additional variant vaccine boosting, according to the National Institutes of Health."

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the vaccination programs worldwide, causing around 25 million children to miss out on lifesaving vaccines.\n\nThe World Health Organization, alongside the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), sounded the alarm on the continued backslide in vaccinations amid the global health crisis in its latest report.\n\nAccording to the organization, the world has recorded the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in three decades during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“This is a red alert for child health. We are witnessing the largest sustained drop in childhood immunization in a generation. The consequences will be measured in lives,” UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said in a press release.\n\nBased on collected data, the percentage of children, who received three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, fell 5% between 2019 to 2021 to 81%. This translates to around 25 million children missing out on one or more doses of the DTP3 vaccine in 2021.\n\nCompared to the previous years, the 2021 percentage saw a significant jump. It was 2 million more than the number of kids who missed out on the vaccines in 2020 — the first year of the pandemic. Meanwhile, it was 6 million more than the reported figure in 2019.\n\nThe big leap in unvaccinated children across the globe signifies the growing number of kids at risk of contracting the devastating diseases prevented by the DTP3 vaccine.\n\nBut the WHO pointed out that it was not just the pandemic that caused the number of vaccinations to dip. Conflicts, environmental challenges, disruptive supplies, and vaccine misinformation contributed to the reduction in childhood vaccinations in recent years.\n\n“While a pandemic hangover was expected last year as a result of COVID-19 disruptions and lockdowns, what we are seeing now is a continued decline. COVID-19 is not an excuse. We need immunization catch-ups for the missing millions or we will inevitably witness more outbreaks, more sick children and greater pressure on already strained health systems,” Russell said.\n\nWHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that while it is crucial for the medical community to tackle COVID-19, there should also be increased efforts in vaccinations for killer diseases like measles and pneumonia, among others. “It’s not a question of either/or, it’s possible to do both,” he added."

        "The fear of the COVID-19 pandemic has seemingly reignited upon the arrival of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant labeled BA.5. But is it really the worst version of the virus?\n\nWhen White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared on MSNBC earlier this week, he did not say anything about BA.5 being the worst strain. Instead, he urged the public to continue masking up indoors and taking caution amid the outbreak.\n\nThe director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did acknowledge that BA.5 is among the highly contagious omicron subvariants but did not mention anything that would cause anyone to panic.\n\nHe even admitted that encouraging Americans to get vaccinated and boosted would be a “hard sell” because “everybody wants to put this pandemic behind us.”\n\nAfter Fauci’s statements, several news outlets reiterated his warning but opted to hype up the new variant by making shocking claims in their headlines, Fox News pointed out Friday.\n\nCNN ran a story Thursday with the headline, “The ‘worst variant’ is here.” The outlet cited Scripps Research professor of molecular medicine and cardiologist Eric Topol, who called BA.5 “The worst version of the virus we’ve seen.”\n\nCompared to the earlier versions of omicron, BA.5 “takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility,” Topol added.\n\nFortune magazine also came up with a stunning headline for its story about the new subvariant that read, “The rise of a new ‘Deltacron’? BA.5 combines the worst traits of omicron with the potential for severity reminiscent of Delta, experts say.”\n\nCiting two studies, the magazine said BA.5 comes with two of omicron’s worst traits — transmissibility and immune invasion. It also added that the new strain affects the lungs just like the delta variant, causing a more severe form of the infection.\n\nOther news outlets called the new variant many other things, and all of them alluded to it being the worst variant yet. The Los Angeles Times called it “dangerous,” while the Philadelphia Inquirer mentioned “super virus” in its report.\n\nThe Daily Beast came up with a moniker for the new subvariant, calling it the “ninja” version of SARS-CoV-2 and regarding it as the “most dangerous yet.”\n\nBA.5 is the latest subvariant from omicron to cause widespread transmissions globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest update that the new strain accounted for 52% of the cases sequenced in late June, up from 37% the week before.\n\n“BA.5 has a growth advantage over the other sublineages of Omicron that are circulating,” WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19 Maria Van Kerkhove said.\n\nThough BA.5 is closely related to its sibling subvariant BA.4, the former is said to be better at evading the immune protection provided by prior infection and vaccination. Hence, it could really be the worst version of the virus yet."

        "Three vaccine doses appear to be insufficient for people with weakened immune systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommends getting the fourth dose for optimum protection against COVID-19.\n\nNew Guidance\n\nThe CDC is keen on having immunocompromised people vaccinated for the fourth time amid reports on some pharmacies turning away people asking for another dose despite being boosted.\n\nThe public health agency revised its guidelines because there’s been “confusion” about the recommendations for the immunocompromised group, per ABC 7. The CDC already issued guidance recommending the fourth dose back in October.\n\nWith the updated guidance, the health organization said people with weakened immune systems should wait for a shorter period to get their additional booster doses amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVaccine Type Guidelines\n\nDuring a meeting of the CDC’s outside vaccine experts on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Friday, agency officials presented the specific updates for the different vaccine types available in the country.\n\nFor those who had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna), the waiting time for the fourth dose has been lowered to three months from five months, based on the data researchers have collected on vaccine efficacy in various studies.\n\nFor those vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine, the revised guidelines indicated that after getting their first booster shot at least 28 days following their primary jab, they need to wait for at least two months before having their second booster.\n\nAccording to experts, immunocompromised people must get boosted because they are at a higher risk of getting infected even if they are fully vaccinated. They are also likely to suffer severe COVID-19 complications once infected. Furthermore, they can potentially harbor mutations leading to more virulent strains.\n\n“In the past two months, I’ve seen many of these immunocompromised patients who had followed all the rules still have significant breakthrough infections. And I really think that this will help dramatically,” Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital clinical director and infectious disease specialist Camille Kotton told Washington Post."

        "A report on California’s COVID-19 deaths revealed that more vaccinated people died due to SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of omicron compared to the number of deaths recorded during the peak of the delta wave.\n\nAn Unsettling Picture\n\nA Bay Area News Group analysis of COVID-19 deaths within the state compared the fatalities during the delta variant surge last summer with the fatalities reported at the height of this winter’s omicron surge.\n\nThe collected data showed an alarming trend as more deaths among vaccinated people were documented during the omicron wave than in the delta wave. Based on the data, 1,331 deaths from fully vaccinated people were reported from Jan. 14 to Feb. 10, 2022, while 533 deaths from fully vaccinated cases were documented from Aug. 25 to Sept. 21, 2021. It is worth noting that 436 of the 1,331 were boosted.\n\nThe figures depicted an unsettling picture since omicron was previously described by medical experts as the strain that caused milder illness compared to the more virulent delta variant. And yet about three times more vaccinated people died of COVID-19 during omicron’s peak than during delta’s heyday.\n\n“We’ve seen some chinks in the armor of vaccines that we didn’t see before. As good as the vaccines are, they’re not 100% protection,” Santa Cruz County Deputy Health Officer Dr. David Ghilarducci told The Mercury News.\n\nOmicron vs. Delta\n\nLate last year, omicron was put in the spotlight after researchers and medical experts started seeing a rise in its transmissions just weeks after it was first reported in South Africa. Preliminary data quickly pushed the World Health Organization to classify the strain as a variant of concern.\n\nScientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 underwent several mutations to transform to omicron, and the resulting variant was more infectious than the delta variant. The high transmissibility of omicron made it a growing concern among medical experts and governments worldwide.\n\nIn January, it was established that the omicron variant had higher transmissibility than the delta strain. Researchers also found that it was 2.7-3.7 times more infectious than delta in vaccinated and boosted people, as per Health.com.\n\nDespite the threat due to its high transmissibility rate, doctors said the omicron variant mostly caused milder illness in vaccinated patients. The decreased severity of omicron was acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the public health agency noted that the gravity of the infection could be affected by the presence of other health concerns and vaccination status.\n\nShould We Be Alarmed?\n\nThe recent analysis on the recorded deaths from omicron and delta may seem worrying. But certain factors should be considered when looking at the whole picture. One of them has to do with the age of the patients.\n\nBased on the collected data, of the 10 COVID-19 patients who died in Santa Cruz County during the reported period, one was in his early 100s, while three were in their 90s. Two other cases were in their 80s, while three more were in their 70s and had underlying conditions. Among the ten, only one was unvaccinated, and he died in his 50s.\n\nUC-San Francisco infectious disease expert Dr. George Rutherford said the raw numbers only made it seem like the incidence of deaths among the vaccinated was worse during the omicron surge. In reality, their rates of dying remained far less than the unvaccinated population.\n\nAnother factor to consider was the difference between the omicron strain and the delta variant. As a more fast-spreading variant, it was inevitable for omicron to infect more people. In January, state figures showed more than 100,000 new cases daily. On the contrary, fewer than 25,000 were testing positive daily during the peak of the delta wave.\n\nGhilarducci pointed out that since more people were fully vaccinated when omicron arrived, fewer unvaccinated people were left to infect. Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody also noted that vaccination rates were higher among older people, so those who were already more at risk of catching the virus would contribute to the growing number of breakthrough infections, which could be fatal for their age.\n\nFighting The Virus\n\nThe CDC has continued to recommend the vaccines as the best tool to fight SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants. For the agency, “getting vaccinated and staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines” is the best way to protect oneself amid the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn addition, precautionary measures such as the wearing of well-fitting masks in indoor public places should still be followed. In February, the CDC launched a new digital tool on its website to help communities decide what prevention steps they should implement based on their local COVID-19 data.\n\nWith the tool, communities are assigned low, medium, or high levels. Low-level communities pertain to areas with a lower number of cases and hospitalizations. These places do not require masks in indoor public settings. Contrariwise, high-level communities require masks indoors and other precautions since they have higher cases and hospitalizations.\n\nThe bottom line is people should not be complacent even though omicron has been receding. Everyone, especially people belonging to the older population and at higher risk, should continue to take caution and follow the COVID-19 guidelines on top of getting vaccinated."

        "People should be wary of two new COVID-19 symptoms observed in patients down with the new omicron subvariant, BA.2.\n\nStealth Omicron Symptoms\n\nA month after the omicron subvariant BA.2 made the headlines for being a “stealth” version of the novel coronavirus, health officials are now warning of two new symptoms not typically seen in patients infected with other variants.\n\nSpokane Regional Health District (SRHD) announced last week that people should also look for dizziness and fatigue when trying to decipher if they have caught the COVID-19 virus. The symptoms were common in BA.2 cases, based on collected data.\n\nThe BA.2 subvariant was previously determined to present slightly different symptoms than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and was also said to spread 30% more easily than its main variant, omicron.\n\nUnderstanding The BA.2 Subvariant\n\nIn late January, health experts said stealth omicron featured mutations comparable to the delta variant instead of its parent variant. Because of this, BA.2 is harder to identify compared to the original omicron version, BA.1.\n\nA PCR test will not easily differentiate BA.2 from the delta strain due to similar mutations. On the other hand, the omicron variant is easy to tell apart from the delta strain using the same test.\n\nAlthough the moniker it was given made it seem like stealth omicron would bring a much bigger problem than delta, that’s not the case. Experts said that aside from not causing more severe illness than the delta variant, the COVID-19 vaccines are also just as effective against BA.2 as other strains of the virus.\n\nAddressing Stealth Omicron\n\nAs of late, stealth omicron is being blamed for the rapid surge in cases of COVID-19 across the globe. However, it is not widespread in the United States despite being reported in all 50 states, according to AL.com.\n\nFor SRHD health officer Francisco Velazquez, it is crucial to monitor symptoms, especially the two newly reported ones, dizziness and fatigue. But since both symptoms are not specific and could come from other conditions and diseases, he encouraged everyone to get vaccinated and boosted to lower the risk of infection.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also been recommending the vaccines as they remain the best weapons against COVID-19 and its variants. COVID vaccines are already available to everyone, including kids as young as 5 years old.\n\nIt is worth noting that the CDC has dubbed stealth omicron as a variant of concern under its parent variant. Scientists reported that a previous infection with the BA.1 strain does not give immunity against BA.2."

        "The coronavirus pandemic certainly affected people's well-being. In a new study that used data from social media, researchers found that its impact on expressed sentiment was much worse than a bad Monday mood.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 outbreak happened, it led to \"emotional distress to citizens beyond those contracting the disease,\" the authors of a new study, published in Nature Human Behavior, noted. However, there isn't exactly a way to measure how it affected people's sentiments.\n\nFor their study, the researchers looked at the language used in 654 million geotagged social media posts from more than 100 countries from Jan. 1 to May 31, 2020. They found that COVID-19 led to \"a sizeable drop\" in expressed sentiment globally, which was especially apparent after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nBy comparison, before the pandemic, people tended to post the most positive moods on social media during weekends and the most negative ones on Mondays, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said in a news release. The researchers even described Monday as \"the unhappiest day.\"\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, however, the sentiment was 4.7 times as large as the drop in sentiment from Sunday to Monday. Furthermore, the change was also larger than the sentiment change in response to extreme temperatures and natural disasters.\n\n\"This suggests that the acute impact of COVID-19 on sentiment is potentially more pronounced than that of extreme hot temperatures and climate disasters,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nAll the countries in the sample saw the change at the beginning of the pandemic, showing the \"universality\" of the sentiment change, the researchers noted. The biggest drops in sentiment were observed in Australia, Spain, the U.K. and Colombia, MIT noted. On the other hand, the countries least affected were Bahrain, Botswana, Greece, Oman and Tunisia.\n\nThe researchers also had other interesting findings. For one, they found that the lockdowns didn't affect the public mood much.\n\n\"Our analysis implies that lockdown policies do not necessarily entail a trade-off between physical health and emotional well-being — at least not for the average population of a country,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"On the one hand, lockdown policies might make people feel secure, and not as scared,\" Siqi Zheng, MIT professor and study co-author, said in the university news release. \"On the other hand, in a lockdown when you cannot have social activities, it's another emotional stress. The impact of lockdown policies perhaps runs in two directions.\"\n\nThe researchers also looked at how long it took the countries to recover from half of this drop in sentiment and found that it varied from 1.2 days in Israel to 29 days in Turkey.\n\n\"It is important to mention that the recovery time not only reflects the emotional resilience towards the pandemic itself,\" the researchers wrote. \"This measure should be interpreted as a combined effect of pandemic severity and regulatory policies, and it may be influenced by other events happening around the first wave of the pandemic within each country.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that their work shows how social media could be used as a tool to determine \"real time measurements of affective states.\" It also adds to the list of studies showing the impacts of the pandemic on people's well-being.\n\nFor instance, a new survey by the American Psychological Association found that school personnel has been experiencing violence, threats and harassment from students during the pandemic, noting that it may be a result of the isolation that the children and teens experienced."

        "A study published Monday with the Lancet medical journal found that people who were bedridden for 7 days or more with COVID-19 were more likely to experience anxiety and depression a year after their diagnosis.\n\n“Our findings are in line with the limited existing literature on both inpatients and outpatients, indicating a link between COVID-19 diagnosis and mental health status,” the study reported.\n\nThe study also found that milder COVID symptoms did not produce the same mental health stressors, and in fact may have improved mental health.\n\nUnnnur Anna Vladimarsdottir, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the University of Iceland, who helped lead the research for this study, told USA Today that close to 80% of those who have had COVID-19 are not at high risk for mental health symptoms in the long term.\n\n“The good news is that the patient group as a whole is not at higher risk of developing long-term (mental health) symptoms,” said Vladimarsdottir. “There might be a relief associated with having gone through the infection.”\n\n“Individuals with a mild COVID-19 infection were able to return to somewhat more normal lives after the benign infection as compared with their more severely impacted counterparts who still could be restrained by fear of ongoing symptoms,” the study read.\n\nHowever, the study could not confirm why those who ‌report more acute COVID symptoms, like those who were bedridden for a week or more, are more at risk for long-term negative mental health symptoms like anxiety and depression.\n\nAlso, since the study began before the pandemic, long COVID was still not a concept people were widely familiar with. So, experiencing lingering symptoms and having no explanation for them may have contributed to some of the depression and anxiety experienced in those with more severe cases of COVID.\n\nThe anxiety and depression seen in acute cases of COVID could also result from the virus itself and its effects on the brain. More research is necessary to understand the long-term effects of COVID.\n\n“In conclusion, in this study, we found that severe COVID-19 acute illness was associated with long-term mental health symptomology among recovered patients,” the study revealed.\n\n“More than a fifth of the included patients with COVID-19 had a severe acute illness course (the large majority at home, although some in hospital), which was associated with persistent risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms up to 16 months after diagnosis,” the study concluded."

        "The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.\n\nOne in four kids with COVID develop lingering problems\n\nOne in four children with COVID-19 symptoms develop \"long COVID,\" according to data pooled from 21 earlier studies conducted in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America.\n\nAmong the 80,071 children with COVID-19 in the studies, 25% developed symptoms that lasted at least 4-to-12 weeks or new persistent symptoms that appeared within 12 weeks, researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.\n\nThe most frequent problems were neuropsychiatric (mood symptoms, fatigue, sleep disorders, headaches, cognitive alterations, dizziness, balance problems), cardiorespiratory (breathing difficulty, congestion, exercise intolerance, chest pain and tightness, cough, irregular heart rhythm), skin-related (excessive sweating, itchiness, hair loss) and gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea). Analyses of data pooled from many different studies with different methodologies cannot yield firm conclusions, the researchers acknowledge. What is clear, however, is that \"children and adolescents have also physical and mental health consequences derived from COVID-19,\" said study coauthor Sonia Villapol of Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas.\n\n\"Identifying the main signs and symptoms of pediatric long COVID can help diagnose, develop better treatments, create multidisciplinary teams for optimal clinical management, and find risk factors for prevention.\"\n\nVaccine protection in mother's milk strongest after mRNA shots\n\nWomen who wish to pass protective antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines to their babies via breast milk should opt for the mRNA shots from Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech, according to a study reported on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nFor the study, 124 lactating women each provided 17 milk samples over a period of 100 days.\n\nThe women had received either an mRNA vaccine or a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca. Researchers measured two types of antibodies in the milk samples - IgA antibodies and IgG antibodies, both of which are thought to play important roles in protecting breastfed infants. Nearly all - 96% to 97% - of the women who received both doses of an mRNA vaccine had detectable IgA antibodies in their milk, while only 39% had antibodies in their milk after two doses of the AstraZeneca shot and 48% after the one-dose J&J vaccine. All the women who received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines had IgG antibodies, compared to only 28% of women who received J&J's shot.\n\n\"An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine is the optimal choice for lactating women when they want to transfer breast milk antibodies to their infants,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOmicron is infectious on surfaces longer than original virus\n\nOmicron particles remain infectious on surfaces for longer periods than particles of the original SARS-CoV-2, according to laboratory experiments.\n\nResearchers put droplets of infectious virus from the original coronavirus version and the Omicron BA.1 variant on a variety of surfaces at room temperature.\n\nOn smooth surfaces (glass, stainless steel and plastic sheet), Omicron was still infectious after seven days, whereas particles of the original SARS-CoV-2 were no longer infectious on stainless steel and plastic sheets by day 4 and on glass by day 7, the researchers reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.\n\nOn tissue paper and printing paper, the original virus was no longer infectious at 30 minutes. Omicron was still infectious at 30 minutes, but no longer after an hour, the researchers said.\n\nFor the most part, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets in the air. While infection via contact with contaminated surfaces is less common, the new study \"highlights the importance of hand hygiene and cleaning on surfaces that are regularly touched by different persons,\" said study coauthor Leo Poon of the University of Hong Kong. \"For surfaces and settings contaminated by a COVID-19 patient, proper cleaning should be done.\""

        "A new study revealed that while long COVID was relatively rare in children, it was still prevalent in hospitalized adolescents, who were over the age of 14.\n\nThe study, recently published in JAMA Network Open, is one of the largest to ever investigate the lingering effects of COVID-19 in children, with more than 2,000 of them tracked for at least 90 days beyond the initial Covid infection.\n\nPer the findings, 9.8% of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 displayed some lingering symptoms for up to three months later. Meanwhile, that rate dropped to 4.6% for non-hospitalized children. An initial hospitalization of 48 or more hours and four or more symptoms at the initial ED visit were also associated with long COVID.\n\n“We found that in some children, illness with COVID-19 is associated with reporting persistent symptoms after 3 months. Our result suggest that appropriate guidance and follow-up are needed, especially for children at high risk for long COVID,” said principal investigator Stephen Freedman with the Cumming School of Medicine at University of Calgary and Alberta Health Services.\n\n\"Reported rates of long COVID in adults are substantially higher than what we found in children . Our findings can inform public health policy decisions regarding COVID-19 mitigation strategies for children and screening approaches for long COVID among those with severe infections,” added co-principal investigator Nathan Kuppermann from University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento.\n\nAccording to the study findings, the most reported persistent symptoms in children included cough, weakness or fatigue, and difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath.\n\nBut exactly why older children seem more likely to develop long COVID compared to younger children is still unclear. One hypothesis suggests older children are more likely to be able to verbalize specific symptoms compared to young children.\n\nWhile the findings of the study is somewhat good news for parents, it still indicates that for a small minority of young people, the persistent condition is still a problem.\n\nTo that end, experts suggest multidisciplinary care if the symptoms start impacting the quality of life. Of course, preventing Covid in the first place is still the ideal course of action."

        "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has officially endorsed Novavax – a more traditional kind of vaccine – for U.S. adults who remain unvaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nJust last week, the U.S Food and Drug Administration cleared the so-called protein vaccine for COVID-19. But the final hurdle was securing a recommendation from the CDC.\n\nIn a recent press release, however, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated that their committee of independent advisors voted unanimously to recommend the vaccine for people 18 years old and above.\n\n“Today, we have expanded the options available to adults in the U.S. by recommending another safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If you have been waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine built on a different technology than those previously available, now is the time to join the millions of Americans who have been vaccinated,” Walensky said.\n\nFor the past two years, most Americans have already gotten at least their primary vaccination against COVID-19. However, CDC officials said that there are still 26-37 million adults who haven’t had a single dose yet – and this population is the one that Novavax will be targeting for now.\n\n“We really need to focus on that population,” added CDC adviser Dr. Oliver Brooks, the past president of the National Medical Association, saying that he hopes the vaccine will finally convince the unvaccinated.\n\nThe approval and endorsement from the CDC complete the two-year journey for Novavax, one of the early participants in the U.S. to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. Now, Novavax’s vaccine will enter the country at a time when around 77% are fully vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson shots.\n\nBased on clinical trial data, the vaccine is 90% effective at preventing overall illness and 100% effective at stopping severe disease when the alpha COVID variant was still dominant. The company has not yet published data regarding the vaccine’s real-world effectiveness against omicron and its subvariants.\n\nUnlike Pfizer and Moderna’s shots, the Novavax vaccine is based on protein subunit technology, the same technology used in flu, whooping cough, and hepatitis B vaccines.\n\nThe vaccines are stored at refrigerator temperatures, compared to Pfizer and Moderna’s shots that require a subzero environment."

        "A team of scientists from Yale recently developed a new COVID vaccine that offers superior immune protection against omicron variants.\n\nDubbed Omnivax, the new vaccine reportedly increased neutralizing antibody response against the BA.1 and BA.2.12.1 omicron subvariants in pre-immunized mice 19-fold and eight-fold, respectively, when compared with the standard mRNA vaccines.\n\nDetails on the improved response against the BA.1 subvariant were published in the journal Nature Communications, while the results of the study involving the BA.2 subvariant were published in the journal Cell Discovery.\n\n\"While standard mRNA vaccines still offer protection against infection from new variants, their effectiveness wanes over time and was compromised due to immune escaping mutations in emerging variants. We wanted to see if we could develop variant-specific vaccines that offer additional protection against emerging subvariants,” said Sidi Chen, an associate professor of genetics at Yale School of Medicine and senior author of both studies.\n\nDeveloped in Chen’s lab by a team headed by postdoctoral associate Zhenhao Fang, the experimental vaccines used engineered lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells with \"instructions\" to create spike proteins from mutating variants. The virus uses the proteins to infect cells.\n\nThe mutations reportedly blunted the protection of earlier mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nResearchers managed to develop the engineered lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines quickly. After the BA.1 subvariant emerged in mid-November, the researchers were able to create a vaccine against the new strain by mid-December. But testing for vaccine efficacy was not completed until February.\n\n\"Although translating the new vaccine candidate from bench to bedside requires rigorous testing in human trials, these preclinical studies provide a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of an omicron-specific vaccine candidate, which will hopefully fuel the development of next-generation COVID vaccines,\" Chen said.\n\nWith the recent rise of the new BA.4 and BA.5 variants, Yale researchers are now at work testing a new vaccine candidate on mice.\n\nChen said that while they have a system in place capable of quickly combating the emerging subvariants, adjustments to the system are needed to respond more promptly to newer health threats."

        "Global corporation AID Genomics Sunday announced it will be halting all investments in Israel and laying off 400 of its 650 Israeli employees, retaining the minimum to fulfill its contractual obligations in the country.\n\nThe company, which has provided over 2 million RT-PCR test kits to the State of Israel and invested over NIS 300 million ($87,280,000), says it is stopping all R&D because it no longer trusts Israel’s Health Ministry.\n\n“We no longer believe the Ministry of Health,” said CEO and Co-Founder Snir Zano, according to Calcalist. “We invested tens of millions of shekels developing our technology in Israel, but we were held back for many months. We no longer believe the State of Israel.”\n\n“In addition, we suffered massive damage in the tens of millions of shekels with the Ben-Gurion airport tender,” he continued. “I don’t see any reason to have an R&D center in Israel when the regulator takes my innovation and transfers it to others. I invested NIS 300 million (approximately $88 million) and everything is being transferred to others. We are now laying off hundreds of people and it breaks my heart, but it is the state which chased us away from here.”\n\nZano is in good company.\n\nAs reported by America’s Frontline News in March, a study among 1,002 Israelis found that less than 17% trusted the Health Ministry over other health experts earlier in the pandemic, and less than 50% considered the Health Ministry’s information to be “very” or “extremely” reliable.\n\nThe study also found that 65.8% want the Health Ministry to publish the data it gave to Pfizer, and 72.7% want the government to publish the side effects of the vaccine, according to Channel 12.\n\nIsrael’s Health Ministry has made little attempt to hide its inconsistencies or lack of data. In a recent report by America’s Frontline News, the ministry was unable to back up its claim that COVID-19 causes brain damage in children, a claim that was used to justify child vaccines.\n\nEarlier this month, the Health Ministry was caught hiding data on child vaccines from the public while approving boosters for children 5-11.\n\nLast month, America’s Frontline News revealed the Ministry had been using incorrect data for months to justify its forced vaccinations.\n\nAlso last month, the Health Ministry went so far as to create a new unit dedicated to prosecuting those who speak ill of the vaccine.\n\nIn May, the Health Ministry tried attacking a peer-reviewed study showing cardiac events caused by the COVID-19 injections but refused to discuss it.\n\nWhen a study found the fourth COVID shot to be unimpressive, the Health Ministry commissioned a new one and bullied a hospital head into restraining her criticism of the injection.\n\nAnd while the ministry promised pregnant women the COVID injections were entirely safe, it admitted in April that it had no data to support that claim.\n\nIn February, Laniado Hospital ER Director Dr. Amir Shahar accused the Health Ministry of feeding false information and a distorted COVID-19 narrative to the public, including grossly misrepresenting data.\n\nA letter from the Health Ministry in December 2021 admitted that there is no scientific basis for mask wearing but continued to enforce a mask mandate until April 2022."

        "On Wednesday April 28, the day before the release of Ronnie Cummins and Dr. Joseph Mercola's new book, The Truth About COVID-19: Exposing The Great Reset, Lockdowns, Vaccine Passports, and the New Normal, please join us at 8 pm Eastern for a COVID-19 tribunal exposing willful misconduct.\n\n\n\nLearn how you can take action!\n\n*****\n\nShortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, Organic Consumers Association (OCA) set out to provide the best health-related information and resources, and the best available reporting on the origins of the virus.\n\nOn health, OCA’s coverage focuses on how best to minimize the risk of becoming infected with the virus—and for those already infected, how to minimize the severity of the symptoms. We emphasize the link between improving overall health, especially through good nutrition, including by boosting Vitamin D levels.\n\nAs the pandemic has unfolded, doctors and scientists have reported that those in the high-risk category include people who suffer underlying health conditions, including diet-related illnesses such as obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension.\n\nWe continue to provide updated information as it relates to food, nutrition, health and the prevention of COVID-19.\n\nWhere did it come from?\n\nOn the origins of COVID-19, we believe it’s of critical importance that the origin of this virus becomes known, in order that the necessary steps can be taken to reduce the risk of future pandemics.\n\nSome scientists posit that COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease that jumped from a bat to humans, possibly via another animal such as a pangolin, and subsequently infected someone at a wet market in Wuhan, China.\n\nZoonotic diseases are responsible for past pandemics, some of which originated in the wild, others in industrial factory farms. Industrial agriculture, which is responsible for widespread wildlife habitat destruction and factory farms that create the perfect conditions for zoonotic diseases, has been at the root of several pandemics, including the H1N1 Swine Flu.\n\nThough not directly implicated in the COVID-19 pandemic, industrial agriculture should be viewed as a potential source of future pandemics.\n\nThe preponderance of evidence indicates thatt COVID-19 is the product of gain-of-function research conducted in a lab, likely in Wuhan, using genetic engineering and animal experimentation. Scientists in this camp reject that the virus could have evolved naturally, in part because of the fact that COVID-19 is by leaps and bounds far more infectious and transmissible than any of the naturally evolved coronaviruses studied in the past.\n\nGain-of-function research, alternately referred to as “biomedical,” \"biodefense” or \"biowarfare\" research, is highly controversial. In 2014, more than 300 scientists called for a moratorium on gain-of-function research. The scientists, known as the Cambridge Working Group, argued that the benefits of these experiments in no way justifies the potential risks.\n\nGetting to the truth, politics aside\n\nNo definitive proof exists for either the zoonotic or lab-created theory. Unfortunately however, the debate has taken on political overtones that threaten to preclude or derail any honest and thorough investigation into the origins of the pandemic.\n\nOCA believes the lab-created theory is far more plausible, based on the evidence uncovered to date. We also believe that, as with any story or investigation involving large sums of money, government involvement, big egos, big industries and huge stakes, it will require relentless investigation and bold reporting to uncover the whole truth. We are committed to both."

        "For the past 18 months OCA and our allies have done our best to search out and expose the shocking (and highly-censored) truth about COVID-19: its origins, nature, virulence, prevention, and treatment. You can look at what we’ve discovered in my new best-selling book, The Truth About COVID-19, co-authored with Dr. Joseph Mercola, with a powerful Foreword by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, which was released at the end of April. Beyond this book, you can read the extensive, daily-updated, archives on COVID-19 compiled by OCA here, here, and here, as well as the archives of our long-time ally U.S. Right to Know.\n\nSo what have we accomplished in terms of COVID Truth–Telling?\n\nFirst of all we, and an international network of independent investigators and scientists, have thoroughly debunked the “official story” (propagated by Communist China, global gene-engineers, military contractors, the U.S. government, Big Pharma, Anthony Fauci, and Bill Gates) that COVID-19 was a natural occurrence, unpredictable and unavoidable, and that critics like us pointing to overwhelming evidence of a lab release are nothing more than tinfoil-hat “conspiracy theorists,” embittered right-wing fanatics, or disinformation specialists.\n\nA poll taken several months ago by Politico and Harvard University indicates that even then (with new evidence coming out daily) 59% of Republican voters and 52% of Democrats believe that SARS CoV-2 came out of an unregulated, accident-prone (dual-use, military and biomedical) virology lab in Wuhan, China. As Yahoo news pointed out: “The survey found that 52 percent of Americans believe coronavirus leaked from a lab, compared with 28 percent who think the pandemic started following human contact with an infected animal. Support for the lab-leak theory is bipartisan, with 52 percent of Democrat and 59 percent of Republican respondents backing the theory.”\n\nMore and more people now understand that all risky, gain-of-function experiments that engineer viruses, bacteria, and insects to become more deadly should be banned, not only in the US and China, but worldwide. OCA’s petition to ban gain-of-function experimentation now has over 65,000 signatures. Please, if you haven’t signed our petition already, do so now, and ask everyone you know to do the same.\n\nSecond of all, more and more people are becoming aware that the “official story” on the nature and virulence of COVID-19 is based on Big Pharma propaganda, faulty statistics, manipulated research, partisan politicking, and panic-mongering journalism, rather than sound science. The official propaganda narrative is that COVID-19 (and now, its highly transmissible, but less virulent variants) pose a mortal threat to everyone, young and old, healthy and unhealthy alike, those with high Vitamin D levels and strong immune systems, as well as those with weak immune systems, i.e. the elderly and immune-compromised, and those with serious and often multiple co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. All of these notions are now being exposed as propaganda rather than fact, propagated 24/7 by those with economic interests in rushed-to market experimental vaccines, drug advertising, government/military contracts, and expensive (and ineffective) patented drugs such as remdesivir.\n\nIn addition more and more people, including a growing number of doctors and health care providers are starting to understand and point out that the 100 million+ Americans (and several billion across the world) that have already developed strong natural antibodies after recovering from COVID have strong natural immunity, apparently far stronger immunity than the short-lived immunity of those who have been injected voluntarily or under pressure with Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Astra-Zeneca “vaccines” and boosters. In the words of Children’s Health Defense, the Biden administration (and blue state governors and mayors) denial of natural immunity, and insistyence on mandatory injections is “tearing the nation apart.”\n\nThe bottom line is that there is no valid scientific, ethical, or political reason (as opposed to greed, social control, and partisan politics) to be injecting children, students, recovered COVID victims, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and those in good health with experimental drugs, especially experimental drugs, according to official VAERS reports, as of October 1, that have caused 778,000 adverse reactions, 16,000 deaths, and 111,000 serious injuries with potential long term damage to millions more. No wonder a number of Scandinavian countries are now banning injections of these experimental drugs into youth.\n\nLast but not least, we and our allies are exposing the truth on the prevention and treatment of COVID, unraveling the official story that these Trump/Biden Warp Speed experimental vaccines are completely safe, effective at preventing infection, and long-lasting. Latest research from 68 nations shows that in fact the most highly vaccinated countries are experiencing the most new cases of COVID-19. Even the militantly pro-vaccine, European Journal of Epidemiology Vaccines recently admitted that the “sole reliance” on vaccination as a primary strategy to mitigate COVID-19 and its adverse consequences “needs to be re-examined,” and that “Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may need to be put in place alongside increasing vaccination rates…” and moreover that “stigmatizing populations over vaccines can do more harm than good, and non-pharmacological prevention efforts needs to be renewed in order to learn to live with COVID in the same manner we continue to live 100 years later with various seasonal alterations of the 1918 Influenza virus.”\n\nMeanwhile, Children’s Health defense points out that latest reports from several highly vaccinated nations indicate that those infected with COVID after being vaccinated are apparently experiencing more serious symptoms than those previously unvaccinated.\n\nIt is now abundantly clear, according to medical professionals such as the Frontline Doctors for COVID Critical Care that natural immunity and alternative prevention and early treatment with off-patent, inexpensive drugs such as Ivermectin (and a protocol that includes Vitamin D, quercetin, zinc, and melatonin) are actually much safer and more effective than Big Pharma’s experimental vaccines.\n\nRonnie Cummins is co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and Regeneration International.

        "On August 27, 2021, the Intelligence Community (IC) released an unclassified summary of a 90-day Biden administration investigation into the origin of COVID-19.\n\nOn whether SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered or if it was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, the report was inconclusive, but stated:\n\nOne IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. These analysts give weight to the inherently risky nature of work on coronaviruses.\n\nThe summary portrayed the U.S. government as unable “to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19” without China’s cooperation, stating that the Intelligence Community “judges they will be unable to provide a more definitive explanation for the origin of COVID-19” without “information on the earliest cases that identified a location of interest or occupational exposure.”\n\nThis is an entirely unsatisfactory and disingenuous statement that fails to acknowledge fact-finding that can and must be completed by the U.S. government.\n\nA full investigation into U.S.-funded virus hunting, gain-of-function experiments on potential pandemic pathogens, and biological weapons research, is urgently needed.\n\nThe U.S. government must engage in a public fact-finding process to gather and declassify information that it alone possesses regarding the origin of COVID-19.\n\nHere are five questions that only the U.S. can answer.\n\n1. Did Ralph Baric hide the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and his infamous lab-created virus SHC014-MA15?\n\nSince the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first published on January 10, 2020, scientists have scoured the coronavirus’s genome for clues to the outbreak’s origins.\n\nThe first thing that everyone wanted to know was how similar the new virus was to known viruses.\n\nWhat would have been truly damning, destroying any possibility of the pandemic having a natural origin, is if SARS-CoV-2 had been most similar to SHC014-MA15, the SARS-like coronavirus engineered by Ralph Baric in his infamous gain-of-function experiments published in the 2015 paper, “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence.”\n\nSHC014-MA15 was “a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.” The House Foreign Affairs Committee Minority Staff, under the leadership of Ranking Member Michael McCaul, summarized the experiment in their August 2021 report, “The Origins of COVID-19: An Investigation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology”:\n\nIn other words, they removed the spike protein from SHC014 and inserted it into a SARS coronavirus that was genetically manipulated to better infect mice. This work was done under BSL-3 conditions. The newly created virus was then shown to bind to ACE2 in humans, replicate “efficiently” in primary human airways cells, and withstand antibodies and vaccines. Researchers concluded that the work “suggests a potential risk of SARS- CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.”\n\nWe have to take Baric’s word for it that SARS-CoV-2 isn’t strikingly similar to SHC014-MA15, because he didn’t deposit the sequence of SHC014-MA15 in GenBank until May 22, 2020! (And, when he did, he misnamed it SHC015-MA15.)\n\nHow reliable is Baric’s claim that the closest known virus to SARS-CoV-2 isn’t SHC014-MA15?\n\nIs there any way to check his work? Are there physical samples of SHC014-MA15 that can be reexamined? Are there lab notes contemporaneous with its creation? Did Baric share the virus or its sequence with other scientists prior to May 22, 2020?\n\nThe Baric Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has the answers to these questions; China’s cooperation is unnecessary.\n\nSo far, the world has accepted at face value the claim of Wuhan Institute of Virology scientist Shi Zhengli that RaTG13 is the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nShi announced this in \"Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin,” on January 23, 2020.\n\nHowever, like Baric, Shi has a credibility problem in that her virus didn’t exist prior to 2020 outside of a short sequence published as RaBtCoV/4991 in 2016’s “Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft.” Shi says that there is no remaining physical sample of the virus available, so no one can check her work.\n\nAn anonymous scientist who blogs at Nerd Has Power says Shi faked RaTG13. He has published pseudonymously as Shu Kang with Li-Meng Yan, a Hong Kong scientist associated with Steven Bannon and Guo Wengui who believes that SARS-CoV-2 is a Chinese bioweapon.\n\nRaTG13 has also been given the side-eye by establishment scientists. An analysis by Eddie Holmes and George Gao, “Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding,” published on January 29, 2020, didn’t even mention RaTG13.\n\nWhen asked why on Twitter on January 30, 2020, Holmes said, “Technically, as it was discovered second, the question should be whether RaTG13 is the same species as 2019-nCoV.”\n\nAnother thing that has complicated the search for the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is that back on September 12, 2019, without explanation, the Wuhan Institute of Virology pulled its virus database offline in the middle of the night, so researchers no longer have access to what was believed to be the largest collection of SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\nHowever, it is the U.S. military that has the largest collection of viruses in the world. Considering that the U.S. was collaborating with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and funding their virus hunting in China, it is very likely that we have duplicate records.\n\nThe Biden Administration should conduct its own comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the coronaviruses in U.S. databases, both natural and lab-made.\n\n2. Why did U.S. government officials collude to hide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered?\n\nEvidence of genetic engineering is written all over SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn January 2020, when scientists examined the genome of SARS-CoV-2 it was immediately clear that the unique feature that made it “100 to 1,000 times” more infectious than the first SARS was something that couldn’t have been achieved through natural recombination. In fact, the virus’s genetic code bore a tell-tale sign that it had been engineered in the lab. This was obvious to every scientist who looked at the virus, even those who later published articles claiming the virus wasn’t engineered.\n\nIt should be a top Biden Administration priority to investigate and hold accountable U.S. government officials, including Anthony Fauci, Francis Collins, and Robert Kadlec, who coordinated with Jeremy Farrar, director of the £29bn Wellcome Trust, to suppress evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered.\n\nThere is no question that they coordinated a cover-up. What we need to learn is why.\n\nEmails obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests by Buzzfeed News and The Washington Post, revealed that on January 31, 2020, Kristian Andersen shared with Fauci the first impressions he and fellow scientists Eddie Holmes, Bob Garry and Mike Worobey had of SARS-CoV-2. They thought that “some of the features (potentially) look engineered” and found “the genome inconsistent with expectation from evolutionary theory.”\n\nIn a conference call led by Farrar the next day, they were persuaded to change their opinion. Publications establishing the natural origin theory of COVID-19 followed.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Kristian Andersen, Eddie Holmes and Bob Garry were among the scientists who published “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,” in which they stated that their “analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposely manipulated virus.”\n\nOn July 7, 2021 Kristian Andersen, Eddie Holmes, Bob Garry and Mike Worobey were among the authors of “The Origins of SARS-CoV-2: A Critical Review”, where they stated that “SARS- CoV-2 carries no evidence of genetic markers one might expect from laboratory experiments,” citing their first paper, “Proximal origin” as their reference for the assertion and acknowledged Farrar’s Wellcome Trust, Collins’ National Institutes of Health and Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases among their funding sources.\n\nThe emails reporting on the February 1, 2020, call were heavily redacted, so it isn’t clear what changed the scientists’ minds. Emails prior to the last days of January have not been made available, so we don’t have a full record of what led up to the February 1 call. It is incumbent on the Biden Administration to complete the record and make it available to the public.\n\nEven with a truncated and redacted record, it is obvious that the organizers of the call controlled the financial resources the scientists relied on for their livelihoods.\n\nIn May 2021, Kristian G. Andersen received a new Center for Research in Emerging Infectious Disease (CREID) funded by Fauci’s National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\n\nWere quid pro quos involved? The Biden Administration must investigate.\n\nA lesser-known aspect of this U.S. government-coordinated cover-up that hasn’t garnered the attention it deserves is a January 2020 analysis conducted for the Director of National Intelligence by the Broad Institute, the organization founded and directed by Biden’s Science Secretary Eric Lander.\n\nBroad Institute scientists working on an Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) program known as FELIX (Finding Engineering-Linked Indicators) claim to have compared SARS-CoV-2 to 58 million virus sequences and, after only 10 minutes of analysis, determined that \"all regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome match naturally-occurring coronaviruses better than they match any other organisms, including any other viruses. This analysis indicates that no sequences from foreign species have been engineered into SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nThis statement is demonstrably false.\n\nThe three bat coronaviruses identified by the FELIX team, BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018C, BtRl-BetaCoV/SC2018 and SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C, do not provide matches for “all regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.”\n\nWhy would they publish a transparently bogus analysis?\n\nMuch of what IARPA does is classified and funded from a classified budget, so it may be that there is more to the FELIX project than has been revealed to the public.\n\nThe ostensible goal of FELIX was to be able to tell the difference between a naturally occurring pathogen and one that was engineered in a lab, but the true purpose of FELIX could be to help scientists get better at what Ralph Baric calls the “no-see-um” technique that keeps detectable fingerprints off lab creations.\n\n“If you know how to detect bioengineering, you theoretically understand how to hide your own,” observed one commentator.\n\nWas FELIX meant to hide bioengineering rather than reveal it?\n\nOr, did it just have a “junk-in, junk-out” problem like the January 2021 Forbes article, “IARPA’s Bioweapon Detection Tools Have Difficulty Finding What They’re Not Looking For,” concluded?\n\nThe FELIX scientists couldn’t figure out how to pin SARS-CoV-2 on the phylogenetic tree.\n\nThey weren’t alone, as phylogeneticist John Wenzel complained on the pages of Cladistics. (He had particularly harsh words for the “Proximal origin” scientists.)\n\nWhat is the reason for these poorly done papers? Were the scientists careless and sloppy?\n\nOr were they trying to do the impossible, wedging a lab-engineered chimera into a phylogenetic tree of naturally occurring viruses?\n\nThis cover-up, intended to bury evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered, happened in the U.S. and only a U.S. investigation can get to the bottom of this.\n\n3. How did U.S. funding contribute to the origin of COVID-19?\n\nThe Biden Administration must conduct a complete audit of all U.S. funding, including from military and classified programs, for coronavirus surveillance, collection, gain-of-function experimentation, countermeasures development and pandemic preparedness.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul’s August 2021 report, “The Origins of COVID-19: An Investigation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” lists U.S. government grants that supported the virus hunting and gain-of-function experiments necessary to produce SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOne of these is the United States Agency for International Development’s Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT program that provided funding for the identification and collection of viruses that had the potential to spillover into human populations.\n\nIt was on PREDICT virus hunts in Yunnan, China, that Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance and Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology found RsSHC014, the virus they gave to Ralph Baric for his infamous gain-of-function experiment. Shi and Daszak announced their discovery of RsSHC014 in their 2013 paper, “Isolation and Characterization of a Bat SARS-Like Coronavirus that Uses the ACE2 Receptor,” and stated that it was found during “a 12-month longitudinal survey (April 2011–September 2012) of SL-CoVs in a colony of Rhinolophus sinicus at a single location in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.”\n\nNot long after (August and September 2012 and April and July 2013), Shi and Daszak discovered the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2, now known as RaTG13. They published a short sequence of it as RaBtCoV/4991 in 2016’s “Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft.”\n\nIt was also during this virus hunt that six men exposed to bat guano ended up in a Kunming hospital with severe pneumonia of an unknown cause. They were admitted to the hospital in April, 2012. Three died. The longest hospitalization lasted into September 2012.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology collected samples from the men in the hospital. Curiously, according to the Genome Sequence Archive, RaTG13 was “was extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,” which suggests that the virus was taken from a sick person, but elsewhere RaTG13 is identified as an RNA sequence taken from a bat fecal swab.\n\nStrangely, none of the PREDICT scientists published anything related to the deadly outbreak, even though spillover events like this were their raison d'etre.\n\nWhat is the significance of the 2012 Kunming SARS-like outbreak and its relationship to the origins of SARS-CoV-2?\n\nIs it a comedy of errors where scientists, who tell funders they can predict the next pandemic, are so inept that they accidentally cause it, making prophets of the lab safety advocates?\n\nOr, has the origin of COVID-19 been grafted on to this spillover event to give an intentionally released genetically engineered virus the semblance of a natural origin?\n\nComplicating things even more is that the viruses collected in Yunnan didn’t stay in Yunnan. As we know, most ended up in Wuhan, 1500 km away where the COVID-19 pandemic began. At least one went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nDid any of the viruses end up with Metabiota?\n\nMetabiota, was on the PREDICT virus hunt with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance. The three organizations published “Evidence for Retrovirus and Paramyxovirus Infection of Multiple Bat Species in China” (2014), an analysis of bat viruses collected in Yunnan, south of Kunming, between November 2011 and March 2012.\n\nMetabiota is a for-profit company funded by Google Ventures that is a notorious Pentagon biological weapons contractor.\n\nIs this why Google’s Eric Schmidt is so interested in suppressing the origin of COVID-19?\n\nEric Schmidt’s foundation is funding the Philip Zelikow-led COVID Commission Planning Group. Jeffrey Skoll’s foundation is chipping in on the official cover-up; like Google, it also funded Metabiota. The Rockefeller Foundation is underwriting the Zelikow snow job, too; it’s directed by Rajiv Shah, who was USAID director at the time of the PREDICT virus hunts.\n\nA little-known fact is that Eric Schmidt launched Predict and Prevent at Google.org in 2008 with donations from Google and Skoll to the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative, a non-profit precursor to Metabiota. Then, he found a home—and hundreds of millions of dollars—for Metabiota at USAID in 2009. That’s how USAID’s PREDICT program got started.\n\nMetabiota is a sketchy defense contractor that’s taken $59.8 million from the federal treasury, but EcoHealth Alliance, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Baric Lab also have ties to the U.S. military.\n\nPeter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance has an unexpected advisor for a public health non-profit: David R. Franz, former commander of Fort Detrick, the largest domestic U.S. military biological weapons research laboratory.\n\nUpon retiring from the military in 1998, Franz received contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to produce microencapsulated anthrax. David Franz worked on the project with Ken Alibek and Charles Bailey, a former Russian biological weapons scientist and a fellow former Fort Detrick commander. Alibek and Bailey’s firm Advanced Biosystems was the prime contractor for the DARPA project, while Franz’s Southern Research Institute was a subcontractor. Bailey and Alibek filed a patent on the silicon microencapsulation technology in 2001.\n\nIn their 2012 article in the peer-reviewed Journal of Bioterrorism & Biodefense, “Evidence for the Source of the 2001 Attack Anthrax,” Martin E. Hugh-Jones, Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and Stuart Jacobsen linked the forensic evidence from the 2001 attack anthrax to the silicon coated anthrax developed by Franz, Alibek and Bailey.\n\nIt is likely David Franz who helped EcoHealth Alliance become such a successful military contractor, with just under $39 million in Pentagon funding from 2013 to 2020. In 2020, Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance received more money from the Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) for Scientific Research Combatting Weapons of Mass Destruction than any other military contractor—$15 million (25.575 percent) of the $60.2 million dispersed.\n\nShi Zhengli and her colleagues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology have collaborated directly with U.S. military scientists and participated in Pentagon funded research.\n\nRalph Baric has also worked very closely with U.S. military scientists, including Kristopher M. Curtis of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick. In fact, as Dr. David E. Martin revealed, Curtis and Baric filed two patents together, “Methods for producing recombinant coronavirus,” in 2001―prior to SARS―and “Compositions of coronaviruses with a recombination-resistant genome,” in 2003.\n\nBaric has published many articles with USAMRIID scientists, including:\n\n• Peter Jahrling who oversaw the BSL-4 labs at Fort Detrick as director of the Integrated Research Facility. Jahrling and Baric’s partnership was profiled in the 2015 article, “Inside the $105 million lab that wants to wipe out MERS and Ebola.” Jahrling is now listed as an IRF Special Volunteer.\n\n• Lisa Hensley who is now the Associate Director of Science at the Fort Detrick Integrated Research Facility.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Baric received funding from the Pentagon through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to develop a “Lung-on-a-Chip” to simulate human lung function in the lab.\n\nIt would be nice to think that Baric was ignorant of the biological weapons potential of his gain-of-function research, but he’s written extensively on the subject, in what can only be described as a how-to-manual for bioweapons enthusiasts.\n\n4. What can U.S. doctors, scientists, military personnel and citizens who were in Wuhan in the second half 2019 tell us about the first cases?\n\nChina should share its data on the index cases of SARS-CoV-2 to identify Wuhan’s patient zero and determine how they got infected, but the U.S. has data on early cases, too.\n\nThere were prominent U.S. doctors and scientists who received early alerts on the 2019 outbreak in Wuhan, including Michael Callahan and Ian Lipkin.\n\nCallahan is reported to have been in Wuhan when the outbreak began and treated early cases. Callahan said he and Chinese doctors analyzed the medical records of more than 6,000 hospitalized patients, 1,100 of whom had severe COVID-19 disease―prior to January 4, 2020.\n\nLipkin was in Beijing not Wuhan, but his joint U.S-Chinese research team was able to “access nationwide blood bank samples taken from pneumonia patients so the group could study whether coronavirus had been present in the population before it was detected in Wuhan.”\n\nCallahan and Lipkin’s communications, records and testimony should be mined for information on the earliest cases in China.\n\nThere may also be additional early SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in U.S. databases, as Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center evolutionary biologist Dr. Jesse Bloom has shown.\n\nAll U.S. citizens in Wuhan in the last half of 2019, including participants in the World Military Games, should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and there should be an attempt to identify the earliest cases and their routes of exposure.\n\nThere are notable failures regarding the testing of quarantined U.S. citizens returning from abroad in early 2020. These should be reviewed.\n\nFinally, there is data available in blood samples collected through NIH’s “All of Us” survey and nasal swabs from the Pentagon’s Respiratory Surveillance Program. So far, analysis of samples from early 2020 show that SARS-CoV-2 may have circulated in the U.S. as early as December 2019.\n\n5. Can the U.S. rebut Chinese accusations that SARS-CoV-2 came from Fort Detrick?\n\nChinese accusations that SARS-CoV-2 originated in the U.S. biological weapons labs at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland, are disingenuous.\n\nIf China wanted to prove that SARS-CoV-2 had been brought to Wuhan by U.S. participants in the World Military Games, they could produce evidence on the earliest cases that demonstrated a connection between the Games and patient zero. Instead, they’ve actually hidden data on cases prior to the December 2019 cluster that they unsuccessfully tied to the seafood market.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to examine the real evidence that something was amiss at Fort Detrick in 2019.\n\nGiven that both the U.S. and China are playing a blame game that isn’t getting us any closer to the truth, we can’t rule out the possibility that conspirators in both countries colluded in an intentional release that would look like a lab accident. Knowing what happened with the anthrax attacks in 2001—the official story said a Fort Detrick scientist was the culprit—anything’s possible.\n\nDocuments on the 2019 Fort Detrick shutdown obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests have been redacted to remove information on the pathogens involved in breaches of containment. Were SARS-like viruses involved?\n\nWhy did the Defense Department withhold $104 million from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense in 2019?\n\nA full investigation of the 2019 Fort Detrick shutdown could provide clues to the origin COVID-19, but full transparency is required regardless.\n\nEach of these five questions is necessary to understanding the origin of COVID-19 and can only be answered by the U.S.\n\nAs a first step, the U.S. government should declassify and submit to Congress all of the information reviewed during the 90-day Intelligence Community investigation.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Sign the petition to ban gain-of-function research!\n\nUltimately, what we learn about the origins of COVID-19 is less important than what we do about it.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul’s August 2021 report, “The Origins of COVID-19: An Investigation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology” correctly states:\n\n[T]here is legislation Congress can pass that would not only hold those responsible accountable but also help to prevent a future pandemic, including but not limited to:\n\nInstitute a ban on conducting and funding any work that includes gain-of-function research until an international and legally binding standard is set, and only where that standard is verifiably being followed.\n\nAmericans agree. More than 50,000 people have signed this petition to ban gain-of-function research."

        "If you’ve read anything about the possible lab origins of COVID-19, you’re likely familiar with the roles of Anthony Fauci, David Chistian “Chris” Hassell, Peter Daszak, Shi Zenghli, and Ralph Baric.\n\nTheir names were mentioned frequently on June 29 at an expert forum held by House Republicans entitled “Led By Science: The COVID-19 Origin Story.” Anthony Fauci and David Hassell were even invited to speak, along with NIH director Francis Collins. All three refused.\n\nEach of the people I’ve profiled in my Gain-of-Function Hall of Shame series is complicit in the hunting and manipulation of bat coronaviruses that likely resulted in an industrial accident (or worse) causing SARS-CoV-2 to emerge in the vicinity of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in late 2019.\n\nHowever, recent sleuthing suggests that, while they are indeed the likely suspects, they may also be a carefully chosen group of spokespersons and poster-scientists whose job it is to take the flak for this deadly mistake threatening the multi-billion-dollar emerging infectious disease industry and its gain-of-function research on potential pandemic pathogens.\n\nPeter Daszak made news this week with an addendum to his infamous February 2020 Lancet letter. In the addendum, he finally listed his many conflicts of interests that compromised his roles as Wuhan Institute of Virology funder and collaborator, spokesperson for the anti-lab-leak-hypothesis camp, and COVID origins investigator. What he failed to mention is his long-standing and ongoing relationship with Google.\n\nNatalie Winters’ revealed in the National Pulse that Eric Schmidt’s Google had funded Wuhan collaborator Peter Daszak’s virus experiments for over a decade. The news was explosive for a number of reasons, most notably that:\n\n1. Google has censored the lab origin hypothesis.\n\n2. Eric Schmidt’s foundation is funding the Covid Commission Planning Group.\n\nWinters didn’t link Google to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but I reveal here that Google has funded the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative/Metabiota and HealthMap’s work with the Wuhan Institute of Virology for several years.\n\nMetabiota, HealthMap, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance were partners in USAID’s PREDICT program from 2009 to 2020.\n\nUSAID’s PREDICT and PREVENT programs, launched in 2009, actually began at Google.org in 2008 as the non-profit foundation’s Predict and Prevent program.\n\nIn 2018, the same team launched the Global Virome Project, billed as a 10-year plan to map more than a million unknown viruses at the cost of $1.2 billion.\n\nThen, in 2020, the Global Virome Project was rolled into the Trinity Challenge, led by Google, Microsoft, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Facebook, GSK, the Clinton Health Access Foundation, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Vaccine Confidence Project and several other corporations and corporate non-profits.\n\nIn 2021, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard launched the new, $300 million Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center, collaboration of biopharmaceutical companies, including Genentech (a member of the Roche Group), AstraZeneca, and Novartis and technology and research companies, including DeepMind, Google Research, and Microsoft.\n\nThe new government home and funding source for these efforts is HARPA, the Health Advanced Research Projects Agency. President Biden has formally proposed $6.5 billion in the FY 2021-2022 budget for the agency and Congress is currently reviewing this proposal. Whitney Webb, writing in Unlimited Hangout, warned, “This Biden Proposal Could Make the US a ‘Digital Dictatorship.’”\n\nGoogle is not merely a participant in the pandemic industrial complex, but a major driver of the emerging infectious disease industry, a force that may be more powerful and influential than any other in this sphere, including Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation’s Scott Dowell.\n\nAt best, despite the billions of dollars devoted to these efforts since 2008, Google has failed to predict or prevent a single outbreak or epidemic. At worst, it may have had a hand in causing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGoogle, Metabiota, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Origins of COVID-19\n\nThrough Metabiota, a government-funded for-profit organization that Google Ventures is invested in and partners with, Google has funded and collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology for several years.\n\nMetabiota, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, along with EcoHealth Alliance, were members of the PREDICT and PREDICT-2 Consortiums which dispersed $211.8 million in USAID PREDICT grants between 2009 and 2020.\n\nThe three organizations received PREDICT funding for work they published together in May 2014, “Evidence for Retrovirus and Paramyxovirus Infection of Multiple Bat Species in China,” an analysis of bat viruses collected in Yunnan near Pu’er City, south of Kunming, between November 2011 and March 2012.\n\nThat places Google at a scene of a very significant moment in the COVID-19 origin story.\n\nIt was in Kunming, just after Metabiota, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance had finished their virus hunt that six men exposed to bat guano were hospitalized with severe pneumonia of an unknown cause. They were admitted to the hospital in April. Three died. The longest hospitalization lasted into September.\n\nIt was during and after that outbreak, (August and September 2012 and April and July 2013) that Shi Zhengli, working under a grant from Anthony Fauci’s National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discovered the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 in the same cave where the six men had been working.\n\nIn February 2020, Shi published the same virus as RaTG13, calling attention to its similarities to SARS-CoV-2 without mentioning the virus’s relationship to the hospitalized men or the fact that it had been published as RaBtCoV/4991 in 2016’s “Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft.”\n\nThe omission tells us there’s something about the hospitalized men Shi Zhengli doesn’t want us to know.\n\nDid the men get sick while “cleaning the bats’ feces inside the cave” for one of the PREDICT research teams?\n\nWas RaTG13 taken from the hospitalized men rather than a bat colony, as Drs. Jonathan Latham and Alison Wilson have suggested?\n\nIs that where Peter Daszak and Shi Zhengli got the virus they gave to Ralph Baric for his infamous gain-of-function experiments published in “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence”? It was around this time (between April 2011 and September 2012) that WIV’s Shi Zhengli and EcoHealth’s Peter Daszak, working with the USAID PREDICT Consortium, discovered the first bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor “at a single location in Kunming.”\n\nNow that we know that Metabiota was virus hunting with the Wuhan Institute of Virology right before the outbreak, could this explain why Google is so interested in suppressing the origins of COVID-19?\n\nStrangely, none of the PREDICT scientists published anything related to the deadly outbreak, even though spillover events like this were their raison d'etre, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology participated in attempts to diagnose the illness.\n\nThe first news of the 2012 outbreak was in March 2014, when Science Magazine ran a story, “A New Killer Virus in China?” about the publication of “Novel Henipa-like Virus, Mojiang Paramyxovirus, in Rats, China, 2012.” According to the authors, an all-Chinese team led by Qi Jin:\n\nWe report on a novel henipa-like virus, Mojiang paramyxovirus (MojV), in rats (Rattus flavipectus) in China.\n\nIn June 2012, in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, China, severe pneumonia without a known cause was diagnosed in 3 persons who had been working in an abandoned mine; all 3 patients died. Half a year later, we investigated the presence of novel zoonotic pathogens in natural hosts in this cave.\n\nDid they go looking for paramyxoviruses because that was what the Metabiota team had been looking for when men cleaning an abandoned mine for them had gotten sick?\n\nGoogle’s Pandemic Profiteering\n\nIn 2008, Google.org committed $30 million to virus hunting and gain-of-function research on potential pandemic pathogens through a project it called Predict and Prevent. At least $5.5 million of that went to Dr. Nathan Wolfe’s non-profit Global Viral Forecasting Initiative, which was soon to become the for-profit Metabiota. Other GVFI funders at the time included the Skoll Foundation, which also gave $5.5 million, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck Research Laboratories and the US Department of Defense.\n\nWhen the GVFI became the for-profit Metabiota, Google Ventures continued to invest. In addition, it created a business partnership with Metabiota, “offering its big-data expertise to help the company serve its customers–insurers, government agencies and other organizations–by offering them forecasting and risk-management tools.” In other words, they sell pandemic insurance!\n\nGoogle’s Predict and Prevent was a profitable investment. The company parlayed the $30 million it bundled through its non-profit Google.org, into hundreds of millions in government grants for its partners in the pandemic industrial complex, including $94 million for its for-profit partner Metabiota since 2008.\n\nIn its first funding cycle, 2009-2014, $74.7 million was dispersed to these partners from USAID through Dr. Jonna Mazet’s One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis. I have not been able to find a record of sub-awards on that grant. In its second funding cycle, 2014-2020, $137.1 million was dispersed, again through Mazet at UC-Davis. The record of sub awards show that EcoHealth Alliance and Metabiota were the primary recipients of round-2 funding, together receiving more than $74 million, often dispersed in matching grants. For instance, they each got $9.1 million in 2016 and $12.7 million in 2015.\n\nBut, Google’s “Predict and Prevent” concept wasn’t just a business or money-making opportunity. It was a means of shaping our understanding of disease threats.\n\nGoogle as Mythmaker\n\nBy embellishing the fiction that most diseases were contracted by humans from wild animals, Google helped to distract from the many health and safety concerns related to the factory farm production of animal protein, bio-weapons research and gain-of-function laboratory experiments on potential pandemic pathogens.\n\nWhen Google launched Predict and Prevent in 2008, it was intended to settle controversies around the role of modern science in the emergence of HIV/AIDS and Ebola (something I discussed in my profile of Anthony Fauci).\n\nGoogle justified Predict and Prevent with an exaggeration of the dubious findings of a 2008 article by Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, that “Three-quarters of new diseases are zoonoses, meaning they've jumped from animals to humans.”\n\nThat assertion was just as controversial in 2008 as the claim that humans got SARS-CoV-2 directly from bats is today.\n\nIt was drawn from a paper by Peter Daszak that doesn’t mention Marburg, the first filovirus ever detected, which was undeniably the result of laboratory workers being exposed to monkey kidney cell cultures during the production of polio vaccines. Daszak designated Lyme disease, Ebola, HIV/AIDS and SARS as natural zoonoses without commenting on the research of independent scientists journalists and researchers, working without institutional funding, who uncovered evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn sum, Google was—and is—in it for myth-making as much as money.\n\nTo the corporations and government agencies it invests in, partners with, has licensing agreements with, and sells ads to, there’s no difference between myth-making and money-making. It’s Google’s biggest asset.\n\nThe product Google sells is its supreme and unrivaled power to shape perceptions through its monopoly control of information accessed through internet searches.\n\nRight now, they manage our perceptions. Ultimately, they aim to manage us.\n\nHow this could play out in the health-monitoring space is the very definition of dystopian. If you have not yet read Whitney Webb’s “This Biden Proposal Could Make the US a ‘Digital Dictatorship,’” please take the time now."

        "As we learned from Dr. Henry Ealy in Monday’s weekly broadcast on data coming into the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, the latest VAERS data for 12-to-17-year-olds include 7 deaths and 271 serious adverse events following COVID vaccination.\n\nVAERS data showed a total of 358,379 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID vaccines, including 5,993 deaths and 29,871 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020 and June 11, 2021.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, the World Health Organization updated its recommendation on who should be vaccinated to read:\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older… [but] discuss your situation with your care provider if you:\n\n•Have a compromised immune system\n\n•Are pregnant (if you are already breastfeeding, you should continue after vaccination)\n\n•Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine)\n\n•Are severely frail\n\nChildren should not be vaccinated for the moment.\n\nThere is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults.\n\nAppallingly, the WHO toned down its language the next day:\n\nChildren and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.\n\nMore evidence is needed on the use of the different COVID-19 vaccines in children to be able to make general recommendations on vaccinating children against COVID-19.\n\nStill, the message is clear: It isn’t worth the risk to vaccinate kids for COVID-19.\n\nTragically, many people in the situations listed above, as well as children 17 and younger, have already been vaccinated and U.S. public health authorities continue to make it their policy to vaccinate them.\n\nThe same day that the WHO said not to vaccinate children, a White House spokesperson said that they planned to start vaccinating children 12 and younger by the end of the year or early 2022.\n\nIn many places children as young as 12 can be vaccinated without the knowledge or consent of their parents.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 23, several venues vaccinating children without parental consent in Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. were picketed by Children’s Health Defense activists. They demonstrated against giving children COVID-19 vaccinations and urged public health authorities to stop the ongoing clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines in children as young as six months old.\n\nConcerned vaccine safety advocates gathered at the vaccine sites to provide vital information needed prior to making potentially life-altering healthcare decisions, urging children to forgo this and any other vaccines until they and their parents have been fully informed of the risks and benefits to children and young adults associated with each vaccine.\n\nChildren’s Health Defense parents sent a strong warning to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, “Don’t mess with our kids!”\n\nIn America, underaged children need parental consent to go to a suntan salon, attend a school field trip or be prescribed any medication. And, they can’t have a drink if they are under the age of 21. Yet these long-held safety guidelines are being cast aside for the experimental COVID-19 vaccines which are still undergoing clinical trials and carry the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) “Emergency Use” status only. Circumventing parental consent is clearly an overreach on the part of federal, state and local health officials.\n\n“Americans aren’t being fully informed when it comes to warp speed, liability-free COVID vaccines,” according to Children’s Health Defense Board Chair Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is receiving unprecedented numbers of reports of injuries and deaths following COVID vaccinations. CHD calls on all lawmakers and public health officials to stop the reckless vaccination of children who are not of age to consent.”\n\nEven as the cardiac risks and heart inflammation affecting children and young adults following COVID-19 vaccination is gaining visibility, a concerted effort is underway to coerce this same group to get the vaccine anyway. In addition to the dire cardiac implications, an estimated 8% of the US population, including children, is at risk of having a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock to COVID-19 vaccines containing polyethylene glycol (PEG). This policy is at worst criminal and at least misguided considering young adults and children have a miniscule risk of hospitalization. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children comprised only 0.00%-0.23% of all COVID-19 deaths, and eight states reported zero child deaths. When children do get the disease, they’ll likely have lifelong immunity.\n\nThe CDC reports that children are less likely to develop severe illness or die from Covid-19 and are more likely to be asymptomatic or show mild systems.\n\nWith lower rates of infection among children compared with adults, the CDC’s recommendations are perplexing. Why encourage a vaccine that has no long term safety data to support its use and carries more risk to children’s health than the actual disease?\n\nAmong the thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths of young people after receiving a COVID vaccine are the following:\n\n•College Athlete Who Recovered From COVID Facing ‘Very Different Future’ After Second Dose of Pfizer Vaccine Triggers Myocarditis\n\n•Dad Says Life ‘Not the Same’ for 21-Year-Old Student Who Developed Myocarditis After Second Moderna Shot\n\n•19-Year-Old College Freshman Dies From Heart Problem One Month After Second Dose of Moderna Vaccine\n\n•Utah mom blames COVID vaccines for blood clots in both son and husband\n\n•Viral Twitter post claims 13yo died of ‘cardiac event’ as doctors consider link between rare heart condition & vaccine in boys\n\n•Seven teenage boys in the U.S. reportedly developed chest pain and heart inflammation within days of receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 shot, according to a new study.\n\n•18 Connecticut Teens Hospitalized for Heart Problems After COVID Vaccines\n\nOver 50% of children in the US now suffer from one or more chronic health conditions. CHD believes that exposures to environmental toxins, including those found in vaccines, play a critical role in the development of these conditions.\n\nThe clinical trials for young adults and children will take a year or more to be finalized, yet the CDC has already suggested that the COVID-19 vaccination can be given concurrently with other vaccines like the meningococcal and human papillomavirus vaccines. The short and long term synergistic effects of administering multiple vaccines simultaneously are completely unknown. If left unchallenged, health authorities will in essence be using America’s children as guinea pigs for the vaccine, some of whom will suffer life long injuries and even death.\n\n“We are at a defining crossroads in human history,” said CHD Executive Director Laura Bono. “The United States and the world are moving towards universal mandates of all vaccines for all children. Adding COVID mandates to the mix will prove deadly for some. The combination of high powered vaccines such as meningitis and HPV along with COVID-19 carries the capacity to injure and even kill. We must act now.”"

Every proposed source such as the Wuhan Seafood Market, Pangolins, Bats, Snakes and processed food imported into China has been thoroughly discredited.\n\nThere is zero credible evidence for the theory that SARS-CoV-2 arose naturally in wild animals, however there is huge body of compelling evidence that points to a lab release. The massive coverup that was orchestrated by the Chinese Government, the WHO and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, in part funded by Anthony Fauci’s NIAID who channeled hundreds of thousands of dollars through Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance is starting to fall apart. This is due to investigations by researchers, virologists, journalists and especially the members of DRASTIC, an international group of virologists who have been unraveling the deception and lies.\n\nThere is very convincing evidence for a smoking gun that points to SARS-CoV-2 being the product of Gain-of-Function genetic engineering that has escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).\n\nThe Furin Cleavage Site\n\nThe spike found on the top of coronaviruses is the part of the virus that attaches to cells to infect them. The spike of SARS-CoV-2 has a very special feature, a segment of 4 amino acids called a furin cleavage site (FCS). This allows the spike to attach to the ACE2 receptors found throughout the human body.\n\nThe FCS allows the virus to use furin in the ACE2 receptors as an enzyme to dissolve (cleave) its coating so it can release its genetic material to infect cells.\n\nThis 4 amino acid sequence furin cleavage site is missing from all the coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus b lineage, the section of viruses that SARS-CoV-2 belongs too. It has been inserted in precisely the best place in the spike to give it the ability to become highly infectious. This is the S1/S2 section of the spike protein diagram below. When it is cleaved (split) at this point, it can release its genetic material to infect the cell via the ACE2 receptor.\n\nImages Courtesy of Segreto et al. Should we discount the laboratory origin of COVID‐19?\n\nThe diagram above shows numerous letters that are part of the genetic code of the spike proteins of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the top virus, followed by its closest known relative RaTG13 and other related viruses in its clade, the Betacoronavirus b lineage. SARS-CoV-2 has a section of four letters, PRRA, that make up the FCS, that are missing from the other viruses. This gap in the code of the other viruses clearly shows that the section of genetic code that makes the FCS has been inserted into SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIt is highly improbable that this FCS has evolved naturally given that there is no sign of it evolving in any of SARS-CoV-2’s relatives in its clade. Viruses are sequenced, analyzed and grouped into clades. The viruses in the same clade are seen as having evolved (mutated) from the same ancestor.\n\nEach of the letters (PRRA) in the genetic code of the FCS are called codons. Each codon makes an amino acid. The codon for P makes the amino acid called proline, R makes arginine and A makes alanine. PRRA stands for proline, arginine, arginine and alanine.\n\nThere are 20 codons for 20 amino acids, however the important codon for the FCS is R. R makes arginine and this is the amino acid that works with furin to enable SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells using the ACE2 receptor.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site has an insertion with 2 R codons, making it double strength, thus optimizing its ability to infect ACE2 receptors. This is very rare in nature.\n\nThe Smoking Gun\n\nThe smoking gun is the make-up of nucleotides in the R codons of the SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site. Each codon is composed of 3 nucleotides. There are four nucleotides that are written as A,G,C and U.\n\nA combination of 3 nucleotides makes the specific amino acid in the codon. The R codon in the SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site is made up of CGG. R codons can also have other combinations of nucleotides to make arginine. These are CGU, CGC, CGA, AGA and AGG.\n\nImage courtesy of Bernd Kaina: Origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Review)\n\nThe preferred nucleotide make-up of R codons varies for different species. Human cells prefer R codons that use CGG, CGT and CGC. The human-preferred CGG combination found in the SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site is the least preferred combination for coronaviruses’s R codon. It is very rare in coronaviruses and yet the SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site has 2 of them.\n\nThe questions are:\n\n1. How did SARS-CoV-2 becomes the only virus in its clade to get an FCS?\n\n2. How did the FCS get 2 R codons?\n\n3. How did SARS-CoV-2 get R codons that are preferred by human cells and are the least preferred coronavirus R codons?\n\n4. How did the FCS get inserted at the perfect spot on the spike?\n\nThese questions are important considering that the FCS with the human-preferred R codons were inserted. No other coronavirus has an FCS composed of two human-preferred R codons at the perfect place on the spike to infect human cells.\n\nNothing close to this combination of an inserted FCS with two codons composed of CGG has been found in a wild coronavirus. The human-preferred R codon of CGG is often used in labs for the genetic modification of viruses in Gain-of-Function experimentation. Using two human R codons to make a very strong FCS is the obvious choice when optimizing a virus to infect people. This is clear evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a laboratory by people and it is not a natural coronavirus. The Smoking Gun.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 was optimized to infect humans from day one\n\nDr Alina Chan and colleagues noted: “Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected.”\n\nA group of scientists led by Professor Nikolai Petrovsky used a computer model to test the way the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound with the receptors of the cells of many species. They were discovered that the spike protein bound more strongly with the human ACE2 receptor than any other species. They wrote: “Notably, this approach surprisingly revealed that the binding energy between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 was highest for humans out of all species tested, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is uniquely evolved to bind and infect cells expressing human ACE2. This finding is particularly surprising as, typically, a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.“\n\nThis is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a laboratory by optimizing it to infect human ACE2 receptors and that it is not a product of natural evolution.\n\nLab Made Origins\n\nGain-of-Function scientists have been genetically modifying coronaviruses since 2001 and leaving no evidence of the GM signatures.\n\nThe first ever fully genetically engineered, synthetic coronavirus was created by Ralph Baric and his team. They assembled a full length mouse coronavirus in 2001 and removed all the inserts that showed that it had been genetically engineered. Baric called this new method ‘No See’m Technology’. Consequently, coronaviruses and other microorganisms are being genetically engineered without any traces.\n\nIn 2003, Baric and his team published another paper showing how they assembled a strain of SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002-3. This fully laboratory made virus was put together like a series of Lego blocks. Once the segments were joined all the genetic engineering signatures were removed by using seamless joining.\n\nBaric and his team published a paper in 2008 where they used genetic engineering to create a synthetic bat coronavirus. They inserted a section of the spike of SARS-CoV-1 so that it could infect humans.\n\nThe researchers used the same seamless joining technique that they used in 2003 to assemble SARS-CoV-1. This clearly shows Gain-of-Function genetic engineering is used to make new coronaviruses with a spike that infects humans that cannot be detected as genetically engineered.\n\nSeamless joining has become so common now that it is routinely used in laboratories. Researchers can buy the tools to do it over the internet. An example of a kit sold online:\n\n“GeneArt® Seamless Cloning is a simple, two step process, consisting of a tube based assembly reaction followed by transformation into One Shot® Chemically Competent TOP10 E. coli. The kit uses the properties of a proprietary enzymatic mix to assemble DNA fragments with shared terminal end homology without leaving any extra sequences or scars behind (seamless).”\n\nThe concern here is that this technology is so widely available that anybody with a good knowledge of university biochemistry can cook up a new disease organism in their kitchen and there would be no tell tale signs that it was genetically modified. This unregulated technology will result in more disasters. It needs to be banned.\n\nWIV Gain-of-Function experimentation with coronaviruses\n\nShi Zheng Li from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) worked with Ralph Baric’s team in 2015 genetically modifying SARS-CoV-1 to create a dangerous synthetic virus. The researchers took the genetic codes for part of the spike from a virus that Shi had isolated from bats found in Yunnan in 2011, and inserted them into SARS-CoV-1.\n\nIn 2016 Shi and her team at the WIV in conjunction with Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance constructed a full-length clone of a bat coronavirus called SL-CoV WIV1. They assembled it in discrete segments. They used the pGEM®-T Easy Vector Systems to join the segments to genetically engineer the virus. This system, available on the internet, gives researchers several options to remove GM signatures of a lab made virus. The online pitch states: “Thus, several options exist to remove the desired insert DNA with a single restriction digestion.”\n\nThis shows that researchers at the WIV have the ability to genetically engineer new viruses and remove the evidence of the genetic engineering.\n\nShi Zheng Li and Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, published a paper in 2017 on how they genetically modified the spikes of eight bat coronaviruses, essentially by cutting and pasting genetic material from other coronaviruses, so that the viruses infected the human ACE2 receptor. This is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 infects to cause COVID-19. They used the pGEM®-T Easy Vector Systems to join the segments to genetically engineer these viruses. Very significantly they showed how they can insert new spikes into viruses.\n\nShi and Daszak et al. stated: “Then any spike could be substituted into the genome of SARSr-CoV WIV1 through this strategy.”\n\nThese published papers clearly show that scientists at WIV have been actively genetically modifying multiple coronaviruses to insert new spikes that can infect human ACE2 receptors, and these new viruses cannot be detected as genetically engineered.\n\nThis clearly shows that Gain-of-Function scientists at WIV have the ability to assemble SARS-CoV-2 from bat coronaviruses, modify the spike protein, insert the FCS into the precise region of the spike and leave no evidence of genetic engineering.\n\nHowever they did leave evidence - 2 human-preferred R codons were inserted into the FCS of SARS-CoV-2. This is the least preferred coronavirus R codon. This R codon of CGG is often used in labs for Gain-of-Function experiments. It is obvious that WIV scientists used 2 human-preferred R codons to construct the PRRA furin cleavage site that has been inserted into the spike and optimized to infect human ACE2 receptors. This is the Smoking Gun.\n\nThe Lab Leak\n\nLab escapes are common events and well documented around the world including China. The original SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) escaped several times from laboratories in China, infecting people.\n\nGain-of-Function experiments on coronaviruses at WIV were done in the low security BSL-2 laboratory rather than the highest security BSL-4 laboratory. The 2016 paper where Shi and her colleagues constructed a full-length clone of a bat coronavirus states it was done at Level 2 laboratory. The 2017 paper, authored by Shi and Daszak, where they cut and pasted new spikes onto 8 bat coronavirus was done at the same Level 2 laboratory. Shi’s paper publish in May 14, 2020, where they worked on the spike genes of multiple coronavirus was done at the Level 2 laboratory.\n\nJosh Rogin wrote in Politico on March 3 about the poor safety standards at WIV. “When they sat down with the scientists at the WIV, the American diplomats were shocked by what they heard. The Chinese researchers told them they didn’t have enough properly trained technicians to safely operate their BSL-4 lab. The Wuhan scientists were asking for more support to get the lab up to top standards.” The diplomats reported back to Washington DC that WIV was an accident waiting to happen.\n\nGiven the information about the inadequate level of biosecurity at high level BSL-4 lab at WIV, the escape of a coronavirus from the less secure BSL-2 laboratory is a very plausible scenario. The outbreak that caused the COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was constructed in a laboratory through Gain-of-Function is overwhelming.\n\n•SARS-CoV-2 is the only virus in its clade with a furin cleavage site\n\n•This FCS has 2 R codons optimizing its binding strength to the ACE2 receptor\n\n•The R codons are preferred by human cells\n\n•They are very rare in coronaviruses as they are the least preferred type of R codon\n\n•This type of R codon, composed of CGG nucleotides, is often used for Gain-of-Function experiments in laboratories\n\n•The FCS was inserted at the perfect spot on the spike\n\nNo other coronavirus has this combination of two human-preferred R codons in an FCS inserted into perfect spot on the spike to infect human ACE2 receptors. There is no coronavirus even close to this combination that exists in the wild. This is clear evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not natural. It was optimized to infect human ACE2 receptors using genetic-engineering in a laboratory in a Gain-of-Function experiment.\n\nThe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from WIV is strong. The COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan and spread to infect the whole world from there. No amount propaganda that it started from wildlife elsewhere or from imported food can alter this fact.\n\n•WIV has been actively genetically modifying coronaviruses via Gain-of-Function so that they infect human ACE2 receptors for many years\n\n•As SARS-CoV-2 is a lab engineered virus, it could have only been released from a laboratory in Wuhan as Wuhan is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n•WIV scientists did the Gain-of-Function experiments in a low security BSL-2 laboratory, not in the high security BSL-4 laboratory\n\n•US diplomats reported that WIV has very poor safety standards and was an accident waiting to happen\n\nThe diplomats were right and the accident happened. We are all paying for it.\n\nCovering up this lab release is the real crime. The people who have done this are responsible for mass murder, millions of seriously ill people, destroyed incomes and damaging poverty. This should be seen as a massive crime against humanity. The Chinese Government, the WHO, Anthony Fauci’s NIAID who channeled hundreds of thousands of dollars through Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance to fund these dangerous experiments at WIV, the scientists at WIV and many other virologists have all been involved in spreading misinformation and actively discrediting the efforts to reveal the truth. The Chinese government has been jailing people who try reveal what happened and don’t comply with their orchestrated propaganda program.\n\nThe truth about the escape should be been made public in the very beginning so that this dangerous virus could have been contained in Wuhan before it was allowed to travel around the world infecting millions of people. The coverup and misinformation allowed uncontrolled spread. The world is paying an awful price for this conspiracy to hide the truth. The truth is coming out now. Those responsible for this coverup need to be held accountable for their collusion that actively contributed to this global pandemic.\n\nIt is critically important to acknowledge that SARS-CoV-2 was made in a laboratory via Gain-of-Function, optimized to infect humans and that it leaked out. Unless the truth is accepted and actions are taken to stop this dangerous research, there will be more laboratory leaks. The next one could be deadlier and far worse. We need to stop this irresponsible and highly dangerous Gain-of-Function experimentation now, to ensure that we can prevent future disasters caused by irresponsible scientists making destructive Frankenstein’s monsters. Mary Shelly’s tale about Dr Frankenstein’s Monster was a prophetic warning - we to need to take this warning seriously if we are to survive.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank the following people for the research they published to reveal the truth: Yuri Deigin, Rosanna Segreto, The members of DRASTIC, USRTK, Nicholas Wade, Bernd Kaina, Josh Rogin, Alina Chan, Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, Jonathan Latham and Allison Wilson.

        "Almost exactly one year ago (April 29, 2020), I wrote what was then considered by many a controversial article called “Murder Most Foul: The Perps Behind COVID-19.” The title of my article was inspired by Bob Dylan’s song “Murder Most Foul,” which was released in February 2020.\n\nDylan’s powerful, haunting ballad revisits the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, in effect a coup d’état carried out by his enemies. Kennedy’s assassination in plain sight and the ensuing cover-up by the Warren Commission was engineered by a ruthless cabal of the Deep State including the CIA, Edgar Hoover’s FBI, the military, military-industrial contractors, Texas oilmen, Vice-President Lyndon Johnson, the mafia, Cuban exiles, and an indentured mass media. This “Murder Most Foul,” the Great Reset of the 1960s, was welcomed, aided, and abetted, by strategic elements of the corporate elite, including war hawks in the conservative wings of the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nUnfortunately, one year after the advent of COVID-19, we are staring into the crosshairs of another Great Reset, this time spearheaded in the U.S. by corporate liberals, Big Tech billionaires, biowarfare developers, and Big Pharma. Our contemporary Great Reset is unfolding rapidly, with powerful technocrats and medical czars taking advantage of the COVID-19 epidemic, controlling information, engendering mass panic, and through Emergency decrees, implementing lockdowns, school and business closures, placing unprecedented restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nToday’s Biofascism, to use the term coined by Naomi Wolf, rather than being orchestrated by political conservatives, as in the post-Kennedy era, is politically championed most strongly by liberals and progressives in the Democratic Party, Silicon Valley billionaires, and their scientific and health apparatchiks. These neo-liberals and technocrats have mastered the art of weaponizing, not only viruses, but public health policy as well, based upon sophisticated scientific lies and false statistics. Hiding behind the façade of social liberalism, public health, racial and economic justice, and environmental sustainability, utilizing intimidation, media censorship, anti-Trump sentiment, and panic-mongering, these modern day authoritarians have managed to concentrate political power, social control, and wealth in an unprecedented manner. As Wolf warns us:\n\n“Terrorism served from 2001 until the start of the COVID pandemic to be that terrifying internal and external threat that was used up by the administrations, from Bush to Obama, to strip us of our liberties. But that ultimately wasn't that effective. There was still freedom in the world. People were not saying, ‘Okay, ISIS exists therefore I'm going to give up my First Amendment liberties, my Fourth Amendment liberties, my Second Amendment liberties and so on…’ We're seeing a complete takeover of American rights and freedoms and bodies by Big Tech, which is up double digit to triple digit billions, since the pandemic began. China, which has moved in to solidify subversion of our nation and establish its role as the global superpower under the guise of this pandemic, and buying up community groups, elected officials and so on and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [Big Pharma the CDC], which as I mentioned, are flooding K to 12 education… flooding universities with money to engage in COVID education, which means a strict party line that is aimed at destroying what's human about us and what's free. That's it in a nutshell. It's unbelievably terrifying.”\n\nIn “Murder Most Foul” I laid out the growing body of evidence, even a year ago, that SARS-CoV-2 was definitely not a natural, and therefore unavoidable, occurrence (a “zoonotic” or animal to human spillover event), but rather an accidental lab release of a virus, genetically engineered to be highly transmissible to humans, posing a serious threat to the elderly and those in poor health. Although there is no compelling evidence that COVID-19 was deliberately, rather than accidentally released, there is certainly ample evidence that COVID-19 had been widely predicted and planned for, specifically in an October 2019 New York City planning simulation conference, called Event 201, organized by the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum, with participation by corporate leaders and CIA operatives, among others.\n\nEvent 201 eerily foreshadowed and “played out” the panic that would arise and the draconian countermeasures that were likely to be implemented when COVID-19 emerged. A primary focus of Event 201 was to discuss how the elite could best censor and counteract problematic narratives about the virus, public disagreement with pandemic measures, and doubts about vaccine safety.\n\nMad Science and Mass Murder\n\nRather than being a phenomena of natural evolution, unpreventable and unpredicted, SARS-CoV-2 was if fact jointly engineered by Chinese and US scientists, (including Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Vinett Menachery from the University of Texas, and Shi Zhingli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and others) with funding by both the Chinese and U.S. governments and military, including Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nSARS-CoV-2 was created in a “dual-use,” (i.e. bioweapon and biomedical) lab in Wuhan China which, according to US State Department inspectors, was under-staffed, badly-managed, and accident-prone. US government funds for dangerous gain-of-function virus weaponization, supposedly halted by the Obama Administration between 2014-2017, were simply shifted overseas by Anthony Fauci’s NIH and the EcoHealth Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Leaked from Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 began spreading across China and the world, with China and the World Health Organization (whose dominant funders include China, Bill Gates, and the US) covering up and downplaying the rapid spread of COVID-19 for several months, at the same time working overtime to cover up its evermore obvious lab origins.\n\nMost of the public still do not understand that COVID-19 came from a lab leak and dangerous “gain-of-function” lab engineering. Paralyzed by fear, anger, and guilt, and bombarded by mass media propaganda and corrupt science, most people, liberals and progressives in particular, still naively believe that the lab origin hypothesis is a baseless, Trump-inspired “conspiracy theory.” Even lesser known is the fact that this dangerous scientific experimentation, weaponizing viruses and bacteria, is still going on—not only across China and the U.S., but all over the world. Even as you read this, a shadowy international network of thousands of virologists, gene engineers, military scientists, and biotech entrepreneurs are weaponizing viruses, bacteria, and microorganisms in basically unregulated and accident-prone civilian and military labs.\n\nToday’s reckless and criminally-negligent gene engineers, vaccine entrepreneurs, and biowarriors, much like their Nazi forebears, hide behind the guise of scientific inquiry, biodefense, biomedicine, and vaccine research. But as investigative reporter and bioweapons expert Sam Husseini writes, gain-of-function/biowarfare scientists in labs such as Wuhan, China and Fort Detrick, Maryland are deliberately and recklessly evading international law:\n\n“Governments that participate in such biological weapon research generally distinguish between ‘biowarfare’ and ‘biodefense,’ as if to paint such ‘defense’ programs as necessary. But this is rhetorical sleight-of-hand; the two concepts are largely indistinguishable.\n\n‘Biodefense’ implies tacit biowarfare, breeding more dangerous pathogens for the alleged purpose of finding a way to fight them. While this work appears to have succeeded in creating deadly and infectious agents, including deadlier flu strains, such ‘defense’ research is impotent in its ability to defend us from this pandemic.”\n\nSo far there is no hard evidence that the coronavirus was deliberately released. But U.S. intelligence agencies have repeatedly informed both the Trump and Biden administrations that secret research, including animal experiments, deliberately increasing the transmissibility and virulence of bat coronaviruses, (simultaneously trying to develop vaccines or antidotes to these viruses) have been carried out in conjunction the Chinese military at the Wuhan lab (or several labs in Wuhan) since at least 2017, and perhaps since 2012. US intelligence agencies also have informed both the Trump and Biden administrations that the first victims of COVID-19 were scientists at the Wuhan lab.\n\nUp until the present time, neither the Trump nor the Biden administrations have really followed through (beyond political rhetoric) with a serious investigation of what really happened in Wuhan, preferring to maintain “business as usual” with America’s most important economic trading partner and strategic investor in trillions of dollars of US Treasury bonds (i.e. government debt). A number of members of Congress (mainly Republicans, but now including Democrats) are finally stepping forward to demand a real investigation, however, with requests from several Senate and House Committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, calling for a comprehensive investigation of the origins of COVID-19, including the role of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institutes of Health (don’t forget the Pentagon) in funding these controversial and unfortunately ongoing “gain-of-function” experiments in the US, China, and across the world.\n\nIn last year’s “Murder Most Foul” I pointed out the obvious inaccuracies, in fact deliberate lies, in the “official story” being put out by the Chinese and U.S. governments, Big Pharma, the mass media, government/military/Big Pharma-funded virologists, the WHO, and self-appointed international health czars such as Bill Gates. The official narrative, no longer credible, is that a relatively non-infectious coronavirus found in bats rapidly evolved into a highly transmissible virus that readily infects vulnerable humans, leaving absolutely no epidemiological nor genetic traces whatsoever in its wake. Moreover, this coronavirus miraculously emerged, in a billion-to-one coincidence, in a densely populated city, Wuhan, China (hundreds of miles from the nearest bat caves) where thousands of bat viruses were stored and where “gain-of-function” experiments were being conducted (a number of which were published in scientific journals) to make bat coronaviruses more infective and virulent.\n\nMany people have noted that the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to be quite different from the Spanish Flu of 1918-1920, which killed 50 million people (young and old, healthy and unhealthy, but especially the young); before mutating and dying out. SARS CoV-2, two years-old this fall, appears to spread readily in closed indoor environments, such as nursing homes, from people exhibiting symptoms of the disease. Although tiny fragments that appear to be COVID-19 under super-magnification (PCR tests) are often detected in peoples’ nasal passages or throats, only a minority of people fail to fight off the virus and actually experience symptoms.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a nano-sized, aerosolized “viral trigger” (far too small to be stopped by cloth masks, though widely dispersed and apparently rarely transmissible outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces); virulent in the sense of magnifying and exacerbating pre-existing co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart, lung, and liver disease) in the elderly and those in poor health; but posing little or no threat to youth and healthy adults with strong immune systems and adequate levels of vitamin D in their bloodstream. In 1918-20, in comparison, even youth with strong immune systems succumbed to the Spanish Flu. Older adults, it is surmised may have developed acquired immunity from previous exposures to related varieties of the flu.\n\nAs we must never tire of repeating, the best defense against COVID-19, is to eat healthy organic food, get plenty of outdoor exercise and sunshine (or Vitamin-D supplements during winter months) and to maintain a strong immune system. For those actually exhibiting symptoms the best course of action recommended by independent doctors and natural health healers is to stay home, treat the virus with proven generic drugs (malaria medicine, ivermectin) or natural health supplements (vitamins, quercetin, zinc) and protocols, and to stay out of the hospital, if at all possible.\n\n“Murder Most Foul” was published in the mass circulation newsletter, Organic Bytes, of the Organic Consumers Association, and circulated among OCA’s million-plus followers on Facebook. (Facebook has subsequently threatened to “deplatform” OCA if we continued to deviate from the official narrative on the origins, nature, virulence, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19). The article generated quite a response, both pro and con. I remember being shocked when I submitted “Murder Most Foul” for publication to several “progressive” or left-wing news sites that had always printed my articles in the past, Common Dreams and Counterpunch, only to have them refuse to print the article. I also remember being shocked to see Peter Daszak of the Fauci/NIH- funded EcoHealth Alliance, one of the perpetrators of COVID-19 and a chief architect of the cover-up, highlighted on Amy Goodman’s Democracy Now newscast, telling progressives that COVID-19 was an entirely natural and unpreventable pandemic, and that those who raised the “pure baloney” hypothesis of a lab release were nothing more than “conspiracy theorists.”\n\nEven today, when more and more mass media organizations are finally admitting the probability of a lab release and government/industry/scientific cover-up, most so-called progressive media (along with Google, Facebook, and the internet giants) with few exceptions are still censoring or slandering alternative information and regurgitating the official story, dangerously misleading the public and destroying their reputations as outlets for free speech, dissent, and alternative sources of information.\n\nWe need to be clear that gain-of-function biowarfare experiments, disguised as biomedicine, are criminal acts in violation of international law, posing a clear and imminent threat to all of us. We need an independent International Tribunal, modeled on the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials, to expose the Mad Scientists and funders of COVID-19. These scientists and funders include high-level Chinese and US government and military officials.\n\nThose brought to public trial must include, among others, scientists, “virus hunters,” and funders of gain-of-function experiments such as Shi Zhengli, Ralph Baric, Vinett Menachery, Peter Daszak, Christian Hassell, Robert Kadlec, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Scott Dowell, and others.\n\nThe international community needs to put these people and their collaborators on trial and hold them accountable for COVID-19 and the disastrous government responses to the pandemic that have wrecked the lives and livelihoods of billions. Beyond bringing these COVID criminals and collaborators to trail, we need to ban all “gain-of-function” weaponization of viruses, bacteria, and microorganisms and shut down all global biowarfare labs and experiments immediately, before the next lab-engineered pathogen escapes or is deliberately released. Please sign and circulate our petition here.\n\nOne Year After\n\nOne year after the onset of the pandemic, my new book, The Truth About COVID-19, co-authored with Dr. Joseph Mercola, with a Foreword by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has just been released. You can order the book here.\n\nWith new information and controversy emerging every day, and with increasing censorship by Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and others, it’s important to go directly to the websites and newsletters of the public interest organizations providing objective information. My top recommendations are: www.Mercola.com, www.ChildrensHealthDefense.org, www.OrganicConsumers.org, and https://usrtk.org/biohazards/origin-of-sars-cov-2-gain-of-function-readings/ Other important websites and newsletters, among others, include www.MillionsAgainstMedicalMandates.org and www.NVIC.org.\n\nFourteen months ago, Dr. Mercola conducted an interview with Dr. Francis Boyle, an expert on biological weapons, who pointed out convincingly that SARS-CoV-2 was not a natural occurrence, but rather a lab release.\n\nSince then there has been a flood of new information from independent investigators, scientists, medical professionals, and even government officials pointing to the preponderance of evidence that COVID-19 was not a natural spillover from bats to humans, but rather a lab accident, a tragic but entirely predictable disaster resulting from the dangerous “gain-of-function” engineering and weaponization of viruses taking place at labs such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the US Military Lab at Ft. Detrick, MD.\n\nThis reckless “gain-of-function” experimentation—the scientific madness that weaponized SARS-CoV-2—has been funded and carried out by partnership among the Chinese, American, and other governments, military, and Big Pharma, even after decades of lab accidents and dangerous releases of potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) across the globe from scores of badly managed and relatively unregulated biomedical/bioweapons labs should have taught them better.\n\nMost recently even the mass media (Washington Post, USA Today, CBS 60 Minutes, USA Today, Newsweek, New York Times, Times of London) are starting to report on the inadequacies of the Chinese government/WHO “investigation” into the origins of COVID-19 and pointing out that even high-level government officials, from both the Trump and Biden administrations, are expressing their views that what we are dealing with is a lab leak, not a natural occurrence, and that we must shut down reckless “gain-of-function” experiments, not only in China and the US, but across the entire world.\n\nRather than repeat what we and others have already written on the lab origins of COVID-19, I urge everyone to regularly check in with the websites listed above\n\nEleven Deadly Lies of COVID-19\n\nPsychologist Dianne Perlman describes the mass fear that has been deliberately engendered in the body politic and public consciousness. This message of mass fear and obedience to authority, repeated over and over again by the mass media, echoed by establishment scientists and politicians, has debilitated the public mind and predisposed the majority to accept the deadly lies that are driving the pandemic and laying down the 1984-style foundations for a Great Reset. Perlman writes:\n\n“We are flooded with debilitating existential fear. People are more dangerous when afraid and more vulnerable to manipulation. People regress and lose higher cognitive functions, capacity for logic, the ability to anticipate consequences and to understand cause and effect.\n\nToo much fear can render people vulnerable to exploitation. Too little allows recklessness. With healthy, optimal fear we can evaluate risks and take appropriate, differentiated precautions, including immune boosting and prophylaxis with diet, supplements and effective treatments on hand. Solutions reduce fear.”\n\nAt least 11 major myths (which are actually deliberately cultivated lies) surrounding COVID-19 have fueled public panic, suppressed alternative information, suppressed proven effective alternative therapies to high-cost patented drugs, (thereby increasing premature deaths triggered by SARS-CoV-2 by as much as 85%), wrecked the livelihoods of the working class, middle class and small business owners (especially racial minorities), and forced an acceptance of draconian lockdowns, censorship, and suppression of constitutional rights.\n\nThese Eleven Deadly Lies include the following: (1) COVID-19 poses a major threat to youth and healthy individuals as well as the elderly and those in poor health. (2) There is no such thing as natural “herd immunity” among those who have come into contact with COVID-19 and successfully fought it off, or actually exhibited symptoms and then recovered. (3) COVID-19 can spread from those who are asymptomatic (those with no symptoms) to others, for example from healthy children and students to teachers or parents. (4) Cloth masks can stop aerosolized nano-sized COVID particles as well as macro-sized liquid droplets (from coughing or sneezing) and therefore should be worn everywhere, not just in hospitals and nursing homes. (5) COVID can spread in the outdoors unless people wear masks at all times. (6) PCR lab tests, no matter what the calibration or magnification, give us a true picture of “cases,” actual infected individuals who can spread the disease. (7) Low-cost generic drugs such as malaria medicine (hydroxychloroquinine) or anti-parasitic, anti-virals like ivermectin are not effective in preventing COVID-19 or preventing infected individuals from hospitalization or death. (8) Natural supplements such as quercetin and zinc and Vitamin-D are not effective in strengthening our immune systems to ward off COVID-19 or to reduce symptoms if the virus does get into our cells and starts replicating. (9) Deaths from COVID-19 (the approximately 6% victims where there are no other serious pre-existing conditions or comorbidities listed on the death certificate) are the same as deaths with COVID-19 (94% of all death certificates listing COVID-19 as a co-factor). (10) New Emergency Use COVID-19 vaccines, which in fact are “vaccines in name only,” since they neither prevent infections or transmission, or death, are safe and effective. (11) New genetically engineered “messenger RNA vaccines,” such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna (which are actually gene therapy drugs), designed to force the human body to produce spike proteins, are safe and effective. For a comprehensive overview of the science refuting these lies see here and also here.\n\nOne of the most important things to keep in mind is that the engineered SARS-CoV-2 virus is not so much a deadly disease in itself like the Spanish Flu of 1918, capable of killing young and old, healthy and unhealthy alike, but is rather a viral trigger that magnifies and exacerbates pre-existing chronic disease and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, dementia, heart, liver, kidney, and lung disease among the elderly and the seriously health-impaired—especially targeting those with seriously compromised natural immune systems.\n\nWhat COVID-19 has exposed to those not blinded by fear is that the real killer underlying the global pandemic is not so much the virus itself, but the deadly “business as usual” collateral damage of conventional food, pollution, work, lifestyle (stress, lack of exercise and sunshine, exposure to low-level radiation) and Big Pharma medicine. SARS-CoV-2, unless preventive and proper treatment protocols are deployed, can be indeed a dangerous biological trigger for those suffering from chronic disease and damaged immune systems. This is why the elderly and health-compromised, those subjected for decades to poison food, polluted environments, unhealthy working conditions, and an overdose of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines with cumulative side effects, need to receive, at no cost, free healthy organic food (especially for schools, day care centers, nursing homes, hospitals, and home delivery for Medicare and Medicaid recipients) as well as the supplements and generic drugs that have proved to be effective across the globe.\n\nGovernment responses based upon a deliberately faulty misrepresentation of the nature of the virus and the groups most at risk, constitute a form of medical malpractice and criminal negligence. But let’s not mince words. Like reckless “gain-of-function” experiments, deliberate censorship of the nature and virulence of COVID-19, and the censorship of effective prevention and treatment of this pandemic constitute mass murder.\n\nIgnoring effective dietary, natural health and generic drug prevention and treatment, and instead imposing “one-size fits all” lockdowns, school closures, mandatory masks and social distancing, and relying totally on experimental gene therapy or rushed to market “Vaccine in Name Only” drugs for COVID-19 based upon fraudulent information force-fed to them by special interests (Big Pharma, Big Tech, and vaccine entrepreneurs) has not only not protected the most vulnerable groups (the elderly and those with serious pre-existing co-morbidities) but has caused enormous economic, political, sociological, psychological, and public health damage.\n\nPutting US Excess Deaths from COVID-19 in Perspective\n\nAs of January 20, 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that just over 400,000 Americans have died either from or with COVID-19, a yearly average of 1,096 per day, with COVID-19 listed on their death certificates, along with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, cancer, dementia and hypertension. As pointed out earlier, CDC data released August 26, 2020, show that only 6 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the US had COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death on the death certificate. The remainder, 94 percent, had an average of 2.6 comorbidities or additional causes of death. Preliminary US death statistics show over 3.1 million total deaths in 2020—approximately 11% more deaths than in 2019.\n\nThe official US death toll from or with COVID-19 sounds tragic and alarming and indeed it is, but we need to keep these statistics in perspective. Of the U.S. population of 328.2 million (2019), approximately 2.8 million died in 2019. This comes out to 7,671 average deaths per day. If the official CDC death toll for 2020 is correct, then there were likely 3.1 million total US deaths in 2020, an average of 8,493 per day, an increase of approximately 11% over 2019. Prior to 2020 and COVID-19, approximately 1.2 million deaths per year have been among those 80 years old or older, with an average of 3,365 deaths per day of this age group.\n\nTwo-thirds of COVID-19’s very elderly or chronically ill victims would likely have died from their pre-existing comorbidities over the next 1-2 years, even without COVID-19 as a biological trigger.\n\nAs former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson points out in his book, Unreported Truths About COVID-19 and Lockdowns:\n\n“From a practical point of view those deaths [the elderly with multiple co-morbidities] are unpreventable. Their timing is a function of the coronavirus, but their cause is underlying conditions such as cancer or heart disease or dementia. Meanwhile children and young adults are at minimal risk from the virus” … Coronavirus targets people at the end of their lives… many victims had only weeks or months to live. By the time they come to nursing homes, most people are very frail. A 2010 study in the ‘Journal of the American Geriatrics Society’ found that half of all people admitted to nursing homes died within five months of admission…”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of COVID-19’s victims in the US (80 percent) have been elderly (65 years or older), with almost all suffering from serious preexisting chronic diseases or medical conditions, and almost half of all deaths taking place in nursing homes. Global deaths in 2020 from or with COVID-19 are estimated to be 2.8 million, (5% of approximately 55 million total deaths), with economic damage estimated at $16 trillion. We are lucky in this regard that what escaped from Wuhan was an engineered bat coronavirus, with relatively low mortality rates, rather than a weaponized, aerosolized version of the much deadlier Bird Flu, which scientists around the world (with funding by Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Pentagon) have been recklessly making more transmissible and virulent through “gain-of-function” engineering.\n\nAsymptomatic Transmission\n\nA key element in COVID-19 panic-mongering, and a key rationale for school closings, lockdowns, and mandatory vaccinations (even of children and students) is that COVID-19 routinely can be transmitted to others, even if a person shows no symptoms of the disease. There is absolutely no peer reviewed science indicating that this is true. Asymptomatic transmission, if it occurs at all, is rare, no more of a health concern than the seasonal flu. As highly-cited physician and Texas A&M professor Dr. Peter McCullough recently testified before the Texas state legislature:\n\n“One of the mistakes I heard today as a rationale for vaccination is asymptomatic spread. And I want to be very clear about this: My opinion is there is a low degree, if any, of asymptomatic spread… The Chinese have published a study … [of] 11 million people. They tried to find [evidence of] asymptomatic spread. You can't find it. And that's been, you know, one of important pieces of misinformation.”\n\nVaccine Mania\n\nAs previous cited psychologist Dianne Perlman points out, the media is pushing a panic narrative that says there is no way to stop COVID-19 without the mandatory injection of experimental drugs, which she calls “Vaccines in Name Only” (VINOs). The media, Big Pharma, and our unelected heath czars such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, have broadcast 24/7 a narrative based upon an “absolute belief in VINO’s necessity, safety and efficacy.” As Perlman goes on, this unending barrage of “Propaganda and disinformation about disinformation is masterful. People can be forgiven for believing what they are told by everyone all the time. Fears are validated by manufactured illusions with false positive infections, misdiagnoses, over-attributions of deaths to COVID, as well as up to 80% of unnecessary deaths by withholding early, effective treatments.\n\nExistentially terrified and misinformed, seduced from every angle, most believe that all will suffer forever until everyone gets VINOs. Social life and the survival of humanity depend on the Vaccine Passport. They are not informed about viable routes to immunity, health, freedom and survival and how the Vaccine Passport is a Trojan Horse for surveillance and control of personal data.\n\nDespite rising opposition to the VPP, coercion will be applied by businesses, industries, colleges, airlines, etc., curtailing freedoms for second class citizens without resolving the pandemic. The goal post will keep moving. Pressure will be inescapable. We have a daunting challenge before us.”\n\nThe inconvenient truth about COVID-19\n\nAs I, and now many others, have stated:\n\nThe primary reason why so many consumers are chronically ill and susceptible to a virus like SARS-CoV-2 is that Big Food and Big Ag in the U.S. (and across the world) basically produce—and in fact are subsidized by governments to produce—what can only be described as junk food commodities. These junk foods and beverages, which make-up 60 percent or more of the calories in the typical American diet, are highly-processed, sugar and carb-laden, laced with pesticide, antibiotic and chemical residues. In toxic combination with the typical American’s overconsumption of factory-farmed meat and animal products, U.S. junk food diets are a literal prescription for chronic disease and premature death.\n\nWhile acknowledging that we have to stop the reckless military/scientific genetic engineering that brought on this pandemic and global economic meltdown, media censorship and suspension of fundamental democratic rights, we also need to defend ourselves and our families by practicing common sense (stay home if you feel sick), and “focused protection” and “focused social distancing,” from those at extreme risk.\n\nBut we also must change our diets, clean up the environment, offer early paid retirement to those front line elderly workers most at risk and collectively move away from the industrialized, degenerate food and farming system that sets up people for premature death and hospitalization from COVID-19.\n\nThe prevention and “cure” for chronic disease and premature death, the prevention and cure for preventing an aerosolized virus like SARS-CoV-2 from moving beyond your nasal passage or your throat into your cells, reproducing massively and making you seriously ill, is not likely to be a patented, for-profit vaccine or VINO (vaccine in name only), rushed to market, genetically engineered to transform your RNA and likely dangerous in terms of collateral damage to your health.\n\nYour best bet for disease prevention and promotion of overall health is organic, regenerative, healthy food and a healthy lifestyle, complemented by appropriate nutritional supplements, herbs and natural health remedies.\n\nStay tuned for further information. And please sign and circulate our citizens petition to ban all biowarfare experimentation, including the weaponization of viruses and bacteria utilizing dangerous genetic engineering and synthetic biology practices.\n\nRonnie Cummins is co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and Regeneration International.

        "Remarkably some scientists in Qatar working with counterparts in New York have undertaken a study asking vital questions.\n\nThey decided to study only the unvaccinated.\n\nObjectively considered, what they discovered should change the exclusively pro-mRNA vaccination policies which currently dominate the entire world.\n\n90% of Qataris are vaccinated, but the authors tracked several hundred thousand unvaccinated individuals and studied how well they were protected from infection, reinfection, and serious Covid illness.\n\nThe authors began by noting that:\n\n“The future of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hinges on virus evolution and duration of immune protection of natural infection against reinfection.”\n\nIn other words: How well does natural immunity work?\n\nThey found:\n\n“Effectiveness of primary infection against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 reinfection was 97.3% (95% CI: 94.9- 98.6%), irrespective of the variant of primary infection or reinfection, and with no evidence for waning. Similar results were found in subgroup analyses for those ≥50 years of age.”"

        "You see, the vaccine’s spike protein is grown by genetically engineering baculoviruses to produce spike, and then infecting insect cells with the baculovirus to turn the whole thing into a spike protein factory.\n\nAt the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting that I live-blogged last week, it was revealed that the Novavax vaccine was being rolled out because it could be marketed as a “more traditional” vaccine, since it was not made from mRNA. Novavax was to be directed to the unvaccinated, although only 10% of the unvaccinated, it was anticipated, would accept it.\n\nThe fact that no fetal cells were used in its development was claimed to be a marketing plus. However, thanks to a reader, it turns out that a human fetal cell line, (HEK) 293F, was used in the testing of the vaccine, as described in an article in Science.\n\nNOTHING about this vaccine is traditional."

        "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, today told the superintendent of schools for the District of Columbia that CHD will sue the school district unless it rescinds its recently announced COVID-19 vaccine mandate for students ages 12 and up.\n\nMiss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nSchools in Washington, D.C., will require all students ages 12 and older to get the COVID-19 vaccine before they can attend school in the fall, despite warnings from legal experts who say the mandate violates federal law.\n\nThe Office of the State Superintendent of Education announced on July 19 that student immunization requirements for the upcoming 2022-2023 school year will include the COVID-19 vaccine for all students who are of an age for which there is a vaccine fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n“On July 8, 2022, the FDA fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine commonly known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for individuals 12 to 15 years old,” said State Superintendent of Education Christina Grant in a press release.\n\n“The approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 12 to 15 means that, unless exempted, any student age 12-15 at the start of the 2022-23 school year must have received the primary COVID-19 vaccine series or have started receiving the shot by Sept. 16, 2022,” she said.\n\n“We want to make sure that all of our students have everything they need for a healthy start to the school year,” Grant added. “This means making sure children see their primary medical provider for a well-child visit and receive all needed immunizations.”\n\nD.C. law requires students in all area schools, including private, parochial and independent schools, to be fully compliant with mandated vaccinations, unless they have an approved exemption. The law also requires schools to verify immunization certification for all students.\n\nThe requirement was detailed in a law the D.C. Council approved last year and is the first legislation of its kind in the region.\n\nCHD demands D.C. Schools rescind mandate\n\nIn a letter sent today to Grant, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), asked Grant to rescind the program or CHD would sue to overturn the mandate.\n\nKennedy said Grant’s press release was incorrect because the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was never fully approved and still remains under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nThe FDA earlier this month granted full approval to Pfizer’s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 15 years old, without convening its vaccine advisory panel.\n\nIn August 2021, the agency granted full licensing of the Comirnaty vaccine for ages 16 and older.\n\nHowever, there are no Comirnaty-labeled vaccines available in the U.S., for any age group.\n\nAlthough courts have upheld many childhood vaccination requirements for licensed and approved vaccines, no court has ever upheld a mandate for schoolchildren for an EUA vaccine, according to Kennedy.\n\nKennedy wrote:\n\n“In fact, a District of Columbia United States District Court held that EUA vaccines cannot be mandated to soldiers in the U.S. military, who enjoy far fewer rights than civilians. Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld, 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003). That court held: ‘… the United States cannot demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs.’ Id. at 135.\n\n“Federal law 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) requires that the person to whom an EUA vaccine is administered be advised, ‘of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.’\n\n“The reason for the right of refusal stems from the fact that EUA products are by definition experimental.\n\n“Under the Nuremberg Code, a universal legal norm, no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is ‘absolutely essential.’ The liability for forced participation in a medical experiment, not to mention liability for injury from such coerced medical intervention, may be incalculable.”\n\nCommenting on the D.C. mandate, CHD President Mary Holland said, “It violates fundamental human rights and international law to force people, and especially children, to take experimental medical products.”\n\n“We sincerely hope the District will reconsider its misguided policy for schoolchildren,” Holland added.\n\nAnother organization — Liberty Counsel — said it may also challenge the District of Columbia’s vaccine mandate.\n\n“There is no FDA-approved COVID shot available and therefore, individuals have a right under the emergency use authorization to refuse these shots,” Matthew Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, told The Epoch Times.\n\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, people receiving an EUA product must be advised that some benefits and risks “are unknown” and given the “option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”\n\n“It is your choice to receive or not receive [the vaccine],” Staver said. “Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care,” according to FDA fact sheets on EUA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSeveral other school systems have attempted, so far unsuccessfully, to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate:\n\n• Louisiana: The Louisiana Department of Health in May said it would no longer seek to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for the upcoming school year because the shot had not received full FDA approval for people under the age of 16.\n\nThe decision came after CHD and thousands of concerned parents on March 16 filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit seeking to stop the Louisana Department of Health from adding COVID-19 vaccines to the state’s school immunization schedule.\n\nThe joint lawsuit was filed in December 2021, by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and state Rep. Raymond Crews against Gov. John Bel Edwards after he announced COVID-19 vaccines would be mandatory for all children age 5 and over at public or private schools.\n\n• Los Angeles: Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Superintendent Alberto Carvalho on April 28 recommended the district postpone its COVID-19 student vaccination mandate until at least July 2023 because the FDA had not fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine for all ages covering grades 7 through 12.\n\nLAUSD officials announced last fall students 12 and older would be required to be vaccinated by the start of the 2022-2023 school year but delayed the mandate because tens of thousands of students still had not complied with the requirement.\n\n• Washington: The Washington State Board of Health in April voted unanimously against adding COVID-19 vaccines to the requirements for students to attend K-12 schools this fall after its advisory group recommended against the requirement. The board said more data was needed about vaccines for ages 5 to 11 and raised concerns that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has yet to be fully approved for ages 5 to 15."

Consent of the individual is ‘absolutely essential.’ The liability for forced participation in a medical experiment, not to mention liability for injury from such coerced medical intervention, may be incalculable.”\n\nCommenting on the D.C. mandate, CHD President Mary Holland said, “It violates fundamental human rights and international law to force people, and especially children, to take experimental medical products.”\n\n“We sincerely hope the District will reconsider its misguided policy for schoolchildren,” Holland added.\n\nAnother organization — Liberty Counsel — said it may also challenge the District of Columbia’s vaccine mandate.\n\n“There is no FDA-approved COVID shot available and therefore, individuals have a right under the emergency use authorization to refuse these shots,” Matthew Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, told The Epoch Times.\n\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, people receiving an EUA product must be advised that some benefits and risks “are unknown” and given the “option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”\n\n“It is your choice to receive or not receive [the vaccine],” Staver said. “Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care,” according to FDA fact sheets on EUA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSeveral other school systems have attempted, so far unsuccessfully, to implement a COVID-19 vaccine mandate:\n\n• Louisiana: The Louisiana Department of Health in May said it would no longer seek to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for the upcoming school year because the shot had not received full FDA approval for people under the age of 16.\n\nThe decision came after CHD and thousands of concerned parents on March 16 filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit seeking to stop the Louisana Department of Health from adding COVID-19 vaccines to the state’s school immunization schedule.\n\nThe joint lawsuit was filed in December 2021, by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and state Rep. Raymond Crews against Gov. John Bel Edwards after he announced COVID-19 vaccines would be mandatory for all children age 5 and over at public or private schools.\n\n• Los Angeles: Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Superintendent Alberto Carvalho on April 28 recommended the district postpone its COVID-19 student vaccination mandate until at least July 2023 because the FDA had not fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine for all ages covering grades 7 through 12.\n\nLAUSD officials announced last fall students 12 and older would be required to be vaccinated by the start of the 2022-2023 school year but delayed the mandate because tens of thousands of students still had not complied with the requirement.\n\n• Washington: The Washington State Board of Health in April voted unanimously against adding COVID-19 vaccines to the requirements for students to attend K-12 schools this fall after its advisory group recommended against the requirement. The board said more data was needed about vaccines for ages 5 to 11 and raised concerns that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has yet to be fully approved for ages 5 to 15."

        "Groups in Canada and Australia are urging public health officials to reconsider rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for young children, following the authorization earlier this month in both countries of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years.\n\nMiss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nGroups in Canada and Australia are urging public health officials to reconsider rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for young children, following the authorization earlier this month in both countries of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years.\n\nThe Australian Vaccine-risks Network (AVN) on July 19 sent an open letter to Dr. Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia’s Department of Health and Aged Care, voting members of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and members of parliament threatening to “move forward with preparations for seeking the intervention of the Federal Court of Australia” if officials don’t respond.\n\nThe Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) on July 14 published an open letter to Canadian health officials stating their members would “be happy to meet you to discuss findings documented in this letter in greater detail.”\n\nBoth letters emphasized three arguments against authorizing the mRNA shots in young children and babies:\n\nChildren don’t need COVID-19 vaccination because they are at extremely low risk of COVID-19. In any case, the mRNA shots don’t work well. The potential harm from the mRNA shots outweighs the benefits for young children.\n\nBoth letters also referenced the June 30 open letter to U.K. health officials from more than 70 physicians and scientists warning against vaccinating younger children against COVID-19.\n\nThe U.K. letter, written in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in mid-June of the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shots for children as young as 6 months, urged U.K. health officials to not “make the same mistake” the FDA made.\n\nAll three letters referenced Søren Brostrøm, director of the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, who in June said, “We did not get much out of having children vaccinated against coronavirus last year.”\n\nAustralia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration on July 18 provisionally approved a pediatric dose of Moderna’s Spikevax COVID-19 shot for children ages 6 months to 5 years old. Rollout of the vaccines is contingent on input from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.\n\nA few days earlier, on July 14, Health Canada authorized the use of Spikevax for children 6 months to 5 years of age. According to the statement, “As a result of this authorization, approximately 1.7 million children are now eligible for vaccination against COVID-19.”\n\nRisks ‘far outweigh’ benefits for children\n\nThe 11-page CCCA letter contains 117 references and six pages of figures and graphs to support the group’s argument that “the data shows that, in the Omicron era, when population-based immunity is widespread, the risks associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines far outweigh the benefits in children.”\n\nThe authors of the CCCA letter criticized the FDA, stating, “no gold standard, placebo-controlled disease endpoint trials, large enough [with at least 800,000 participants] to categorically establish the clinical safety and long-term efficacy of the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations in children 12- to 15-years-old, 5- to 11-years-old, 2- to 4-years-old, and 6-months-old to 23-months-old have been undertaken.”\n\nInstead, the EUA for Pfizer was “based on the preliminary results of four very small immuno-bridging trials, enrolling fewer than 3,000 participants each.”\n\nThe CCCA letter presented data from the Canadian province of Ontario, which “reported a negative dose-response effect for the COVID-19 vaccinations [original emphasis].”\n\nThe letter continued:\n\n“In other words, the proportion of cases of COVID-19 were highest among those who had been ‘boosted,’ lower among the ‘fully inoculated’ and least among the ‘not fully inoculated’ (which includes the ‘uninoculated’).”\n\nThe authors presented graphs from the Public Health Ontario website, noting a similar pattern was observed in the 12- to 17-year-olds and the 5- to 11-year-old age groups.\n\n“Additionally, a greater proportion of ‘boosted’ Ontarians have died, revealing that the vaccinations may be associated with serious secondary effects.”\n\nThe CCCA letter concludes:\n\n“We trust that our research has provided you with evidence needed to adjust Canadian health policy to protect our children from undue harm. We would be happy to meet you to discuss findings documented in this letter in greater detail.”\n\n‘Huge gap’ in Pfizer’s vaccine trial documentation\n\nAccording to the authors of the AVN letter, the Pfizer documentation presented to the FDA had huge gaps in the evidence provided.\n\nFor example, the letter stated:\n\n“The protocol was changed mid-trial. The original two-dose schedule exhibited poor immunogenicity with efficacy far below the required standard. A third dose was added by which time many of the original placebo recipients had been vaccinated.”\n\nThe AVN letter argued the Moderna shot for young children fails to meet Australia’s regulatory requirements to be granted “provisional determination” (similar to EUA in the U.S.) under regulation 10L(1)(a) of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations.\n\nTo receive provisional determination, there must be “an indication of the medicine is the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition,” the letter stated.\n\nThe authors said Australia’s health department and TGA did not “show any data or science to support a conclusion that COVID-19, and particularly the Omicron variant now widespread across Australia, is ‘life-threatening’ to infants aged 6 months up through 4 years, nor indeed that infants 6 months up through 4 years suffer ‘seriously debilitating’ symptoms when infected with COVID-19.”\n\nThe authors also addressed the issue of manipulative strategies used to promote COVID-19 vaccination of children, and said pushing unnecessary and novel mRNA-based vaccines onto young children risks undermining parental confidence in routine immunization programs."

Whether it’s helping coordinate hurricane responses, training our allies abroad, responding to domestic civil unrest, fighting wildfires or establishing COVID-19 field hospitals and treating patients — they’ve been there for us.\n\nWhen the next crisis comes to our shores, the U.S. will lack the number of Guardsmen and women to come to our rescue.\n\nJune 30 marked Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s arbitrary deadline for members of the National Guard and Reserves to receive the COVID-19 vaccine despite Congress’ mandate that the Department of Defense establish uniform procedures under which service members can be exempted.\n\nShould Secretary Austin enforce this mandate on service members who have opted not to get vaccinated due to personal health reasons or religious exemptions, the National Guard will be crippled.\n\nTo date, approximately 60,000 National Guard and Reserves remain unvaccinated and the pending decision from the Biden administration could punish the very service members who have been on the front lines of fighting this pandemic.\n\nNYC Employees Fired for Not Getting COVID Vaccine Grows to More Than 1,750\n\nNew York Post reported:\n\nMore than 1,750 city workers have been fired for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccination — or 200-plus more than previously revealed, the Mayor’s office confirmed Saturday.\n\nIn February, Adams fired 1,430 city employees, including 914 in the Department of Education and 36 in the NYPD, for refusing to get vaccinated. In March, the city fired another 101 workers, including 42 in the DOE, but none in the NYPD. There have been no updates since.\n\nLast month, Adams offered most workers fired for going without a jab a brief period to get their jobs back — provided they got the first dose of a vaccine by June 30 and made arrangements for a second dose by Aug. 15.\n\nMore than 6,000 city workers who applied for medical or religious accommodations or exemptions from the vaccination requirement have yet to get a decision.\n\nCardinals’ Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt Explain Why They Didn’t Get COVID Vaccine\n\nSports Illustrated reported:\n\nOn Sunday it was revealed that Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado and first baseman Paul Goldschmidt will not be allowed to travel to Canada to play the Blue Jays because they’re not vaccinated against COVID-19. Both All-Stars explained why they haven’t gotten vaccinated against the virus.\n\n“It’s just a personal choice, and I’m not trying to do a political stand here or be a spokesperson for this or that,” Arenado said, per MLB.com. “I’m just choosing to do what’s best for me and my family, and I mean no harm. But it’s unfortunate that I’ve got to miss two games.”\n\nIn order to enter Canada, a person must be fully vaccinated against the virus two weeks before traveling there or quarantine upon arrival. By missing the two-game series, Goldschmidt and Arenado will forfeit $285,714 and $384,615, respectively, according to MLB.com’s John Denton.\n\n“It was not an easy decision, but over this year-plus that this has happened, I’ve tried to talk to as many doctors and professionals as I could, figured out as much as I could, and I decided the potential risks outweighed the potential benefits of doing it,” Goldschmidt said.\n\n1 Million Copies Sold — ‘The Real Anthony Fauci’ — BUY TODAY!\n\nPastor Jailed for Holding Church Service During Canada’s Lockdown Wins Legal Victory\n\nThe Daily Wire reported:\n\nA Canadian court has awarded a major legal win to Artur Pawlowski, the pastor who was arrested and jailed for holding a church service during Alberta’s lockdown.\n\nPawlowski, the minister of Calgary Street Church, was arrested by Calgary police in dramatic fashion in the middle of a busy highway on May 8 last year as he was driving home from church, where his congregation had gathered without masks in violation of public health orders.\n\nOn Friday, an Alberta appeals court panel ruled that the Alberta health agency’s order restraining “illegal public gatherings” was “not sufficiently clear and unambiguous” as to apply to the Pawlowski’s.\n\n“The Pawlowskis’ appeals are allowed. The finding of contempt and the sanction order is set aside. The fines that have been paid by them are to be reimbursed,” the three-member panel wrote in their 16-page ruling. The court ordered Alberta Health Services, the province’s health agency, to reimburse Pawlowski for his legal costs, as well as the fines, levied against him.\n\nMask Wearing Required in Kentucky’s Largest School District\n\nAssociated Press reported:\n\nKentucky’s largest school district will require universal masking on school property as Jefferson County moves into the highest level of COVID-19 community spread.\n\nThe change begins Monday and lasts until Jefferson County comes out of the red, media outlets reported. It comes a little more than two weeks before classes resume in Jefferson County Public Schools.\n\nEveryone, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear a mask on district property or on school buses.\n\nUber Admits Covering up Massive 2016 Data Breach in Settlement With U.S. Prosecutors\n\nThe Verge reported:\n\nUber admitted to covering up a massive cybersecurity attack that took place in October 2016, exposing the confidential data of 57 million customers and drivers, as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to avoid criminal prosecution.\n\nIn order to not be prosecuted for the cover-up, Uber “admits that its personnel failed to report the November 2016 data breach to the [Federal Trade Commission] despite a pending FTC investigation into data security at the company,” according to a press release from the DOJ.\n\nHackers used stolen credentials to access a private source code repository and obtain a proprietary access key, which they then used to access and copy large quantities of data associated with Uber’s users and drivers, including data pertaining to approximately 57 million user records with 600,000 driver’s license numbers.\n\nWe Can Regulate Social Media Without Censorship. Here’s How.\n\nTime reported:\n\nIs it wise to try to regulate social media platforms? Can it even be done? These questions are vexing lawmakers in almost every democracy. And finally — after years of debate — some answers are coming into view.\n\nThe basic case for legislative intervention is, in fact, non-partisan. It’s simply that, as more and more of our discourse migrates online, social media platforms are increasingly trusted to draw the borders of free expression. They order, filter and present the world’s information. They set rules about what may be said and who may say it. They approve, and ban, speakers and ideas. And when they do these things, they necessarily apply their own rules, principles, biases, and philosophies.\n\nThat’s not a criticism — sometimes the right will be aggrieved, sometimes the left — but it does mean that the choice is not between regulating speech and leaving it alone. Speech is already being regulated by platforms.\n\nAnd they have potent powers of enforcement: to stifle a voice or an idea with a single click, to make an idea disappear or to go viral. The case for regulation does not depend on the (usually simplistic) claim that particular platforms are actually biased one way or another. The issue is rather that they increasingly have the power to influence democratic discourse without appropriate checks and balances.\n\nSubscribe to The Defender - It’s Free!

Δ\n\nDozens of States Are Jumping on the Social Media Censorship Bandwagon\n\nGizmodo reported:\n\n2022 may be remembered as a turning point for social media regulation, or maybe more aptly, failed social media regulation. Though Texas and Florida managed to dominate headlines recently for their constitutionally questionable deplatforming laws, they’re far from the only states trying to get creative with managing content on social media platforms.\n\nA recent Politico analysis found 34 states, many conservative-leaning but not all, have proposed bills or passed laws vying to influence the way social media companies handle their users’ content.\n\nIn conservative-led states, the dominating trend here follows the Texas and Florida mold. States ranging from Ohio to Mississippi are trying to write laws that would prohibit companies from removing or moderating users’ content based on their political viewpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, legislators in Democratically led states like New York and California are attempting to forward legislation that would encourage social media companies to take a heavier-handed approach to moderating certain types of content deemed harmful.\n\nTwitter Posts $270 Million Loss In First Earnings Report Since Elon Musk ‘Terminated’ $44 Billion Takeover Deal\n\nForbes reported:\n\nSocial media giant Twitter posted a worse-than-expected loss Friday morning in its first earnings report since billionaire Elon Musk backed out on a deal to buy the company, fueled in part by the massive uncertainty around the firm’s fate as it embarks on a potentially lengthy legal battle with the world’s richest person.\n\nSan Francisco-based Twitter reported revenue of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, falling short of average analyst estimates calling for $1.3 billion and slipping 1% from the same period last year.\n\nThe company also reported a worse-than-expected loss of $270 million, or 35 cents per share — compared to expectations for a loss of 7 cents per share and a profit of $66 million in the second quarter last year.\n\nSome Schools Are Restricting Google Chrome Usage Over Security Concerns\n\nTechRadar reported:\n\nSeveral schools and other educational organizations are having to restrict usage of Google‘s software, including its Chrome browser and Chrome OS offerings over security and privacy fears.\n\nThe Dutch Ministry of Education has ordered the country’s education industry to implement the changes following fears that Google’s software is in conflict with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy-related regulations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, these changes include a number of things, such as implementing specific Group Policies, and disabling services such as automatic website translation, or spell checks."

        "Share this\n\nThe World Council for Health (WCH) is continuously monitoring the emergence of new and old diseases around the world with potential for health concerns. Recent news from Ghana has confirmed two cases of Marburg virus, which were reported by Ghana Health Service on Monday, July 18, 2022. Two people diagnosed with Marburg on July 10, 2022, have since died. According to the World Health Organization, more than 90 contacts have been identified and are being monitored at this time. No new cases have been detected, according to the Ghana Health Service.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) raised the concern of the Marburg virus as a future pandemic in August 2021, a notion first proposed by VaccinesWork, a platform hosted by the Bill Gates-funded Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in April 2021.\n\nWhat is Marburg Virus?\n\nMarburg virus is a genetically unique zoonotic RNA virus of the same family as the Ebola virus (Filovirus). It is reported to have first been discovered in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and in Belgrade in Serbia and was associated with the import of African green monkeys from Uganda for laboratory work. According to the CDC, 31 people became ill and seven died.\n\nSince then, sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. In a 2014 incident in Uganda in which there was one human case and one death, 197 close contacts were followed and none died. Case fatality rates for Marburg have varied from 24% to 88% during previous outbreaks.\n\nKnown Cases and Outbreaks of Marburg Virus\n\n1967: Germany and Serbia 31 human cases, 7 deaths\n\n1975: Johannesburg, South Africa 3 human cases, 1 death (linked to travel from Zimbabwe)\n\n1980: Kenya 2 human cases, 1 death\n\n1987: Kenya 1 human case, 1 death\n\n1990: Russia 1 human case, 1 death (due to laboratory contamination)\n\n1998-2000: Democratic Republic of Congo 154 human cases, 128 deaths\n\n2004-2005: Uganda 4 human cases, 1 death\n\n2008: USA 1 human case (linked to travel from Uganda)\n\n2008: Netherlands 1 human case, 1 death (linked to travel from Uganda)\n\n2012: Uganda 15 human cases, 4 deaths\n\n2014: Uganda 1 human case, 1 death\n\n2017: Uganda 4 cases, 3 deaths\n\n2021: Guinea 1 human case, 1 death\n\n2022: Ghana 2 human cases, 2 deaths\n\nClinical Manifestations of Marburg Virus\n\nIllness associated with Marburg virus manifests with sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle pains followed three days later by watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, people may develop hemorrhaging, severe shock, extreme blood loss, and subsequent death.\n\nMarburg is spread through contact with bodily fluids. The key to recovery from Marburg is early diagnosis, symptomatic treatment, and support. Avoid eating and handling bushmeat and avoid touching infected individuals without hand protection.\n\nThe World Council for Health continues to carefully monitor the occurrence of Marburg, Monkeypox, and other specific health threats highlighted by the WHO. WCH emphasizes that there currently exists no indication to support potential calls for a new pandemic associated with the Marburg virus."

        "Share this\n\nOverview\n\nThe virus that causes Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. In early 2020, the mainstream scientific consensus was that the novel virus, named SARS-CoV-2, originated from a mutation of a beta-coronavirus naturally circulating in bats. At the same time, emerging evidence suggesting that the novel coronavirus may have entered human populations as a result of a lab leak were dismissed.\n\nAlmost two years on, the lab-leak hypothesis has been gaining momentum, with suggestions that the virus may have been the product of gain-of-function research and it was accidentally or deliberately released. This evidence includes the lack of an identified intermediate animal host, genetic signatures typical of genetic engineering rather than natural selection, and leaked documents that reveal international collaboration in gain-of-function research in China.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe majority of people infected with coronavirus disease will encounter mild to moderate respiratory illness and will regain health without needing specialized treatment.\n\nOlder people and individuals who have underlying medical conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more susceptible to developing severe illness.\n\nSome people infected with the coronavirus have mild symptoms, and others have no symptoms at all. In severe cases, however, Covid-19 can lead to more complicated medical conditions such as respiratory failure, nervous system problems, or death.\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\ndry cough\n\ntiredness\n\nfever\n\nLess common symptoms include:\n\nsore throat\n\ndiarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and other stomach problems\n\nconjunctivitis\n\nheadache\n\nmuscle and or/ body aches and pains\n\nrashes on the skin, discoloration of fingers or toes\n\nloss of taste and/or smell\n\nSerious symptoms include:\n\nchest pain and/or pressure\n\nloss of speech and/or movement\n\ntrouble breathing and/or shortness of breath\n\nIf you are presenting with a serious illness, you should seek medical attention by contacting your healthcare provider. People with mild symptoms should be able to recover at home.\n\nIt generally takes between 5–6 days from when an individual is infected with Coronavirus Disease for symptoms to appear and can take up to 14 days after exposure. An infected person with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to 2 days before symptoms appear. They remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and the severity of their illness. Once an individual has come out the other side, they likely will have developed a natural immunity from the disease which is the best way to protect the body from future infection.\n\nLong Covid\n\nSymptoms of covid that persist longer than four weeks after recovery from infection have been labeled ‘long covid’. The symptoms are similar to those of covid and can include:\n\nsevere tiredness\n\npins and needles\n\nissues with concentration and memory sometimes referred to as “brain fog”\n\ntrouble sleeping (insomnia)\n\nearaches, tinnitus\n\ndepression and anxiety\n\nTreatments\n\nThere are various ways of treating Covid-19 and most people will not require hospital care. One of the most effective ways of combating the disease is through early intervention with combination therapies that commonly include anti-virals, anti-inflammatories, anticoagulants, and antibiotics.\n\nSupplements are also critical to keep the immune system healthy. It is recommended that if individuals do come down with Covid-19, they should follow treatment protocols to combat the illness early. These can be found in our new Covid-19 Treatment Guide.\n\nOne of the best ways to protect yourself against having severe covid is to boost your body’s natural defenses. This can include making sure you are physically fit, eating a balanced nutritious diet, getting enough vitamin D through sunlight, and getting an adequate amount of sleep."

To say that the last two years of pure distance learning (self-learning modules) is problematic and likely ineffective is reasonable, for without literate guardians, school-age children struggle in the process of individual learning. Therefore, the decision to transition to full face-to-face classes soon is only necessary for the development of well-rounded Filipino children.\n\nSeveral critics lambasted the decision amidst the current surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. However, Dr. Mary Ann Bunyi, president of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society of the Philippines, said in 2021 that children who contracted COVID-19 accounted for “less than 10 percent of the country’s total cases.” She added that children have strong resistance to the coronavirus disease, where those infected only manifest mild symptoms. Against this scientific evidence, VP and EduSec Duterte maintained that pediatric vaccination is not mandatory and “co-mingling of vaccinated and unvaccinated learners will be allowed in the classrooms.”\n\nIn conjunction with the VP’s pronouncement, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared that overall mandatory vaccination is not necessary and that a law is not required, acknowledging the public’s right to self-determination. Nonetheless, he still advocates for vaccination and the benefits one gets from getting vaccinated, essentially turning a blind eye to cases of adverse events and deaths. His administration also plans for a massive vaccination campaign to be spearheaded by the Department of Health, Department of the Interior and Local Government, and the Department of Education.\n\nThe “mandatory vaccination” buzzword is often denied by the national administration but is de facto implemented in systemic levels, giving workers in both government agencies and private sector[1] two options: get vaccinated or get terminated. If President Marcos Jr. is straightforward in his non-mandatory vaccination strategy, he must shape a more rigorous policy that penalizes employers pursuing mandatory vaccination. After all, didn’t he say, “We don’t really need to pass it into a law because we can still choose what’s best for our own health”?\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

        "SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19\n\nMost coronaviruses, including those causing the common cold, are not associated with significant mortality. The novel SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) identified in 2019 causes a collection of symptoms that can cause severe illness, which has become known as COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is contagious. and infected persons can be asymptomatic or exhibit symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms include fever; chills; cough; shortness of breath/difficulty breathing; fatigue; muscle, joint or body aches; rash; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nComplications of SARS-CoV-2 include pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, Acute, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney, liver, and heart injury, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), chronic fatigue syndrome, blood clots and death. Many complications may be caused by a condition known as a cytokine storm.\n\nResearch on natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection varies and suggests that durable immunity to the virus lasts for at least eight months and may be life-long. An August 2021 retrospective study of Israel’s second largest HMO, yet to undergo peer review, found that natural immunity “confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease, and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant.”\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\n\nNew ways to make vaccines including new technologies and production platforms, such as mRNA vaccines, have become favored over the older traditional ways to make vaccines in the COVID-19 vaccine race. Currently, three experimental COVID-19 vaccines and one licensed COVID-19 vaccine have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for distribution and use in the U.S. Of the four vaccines in use, three are mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and one utilizes a human adenovirus vector (Janssen). Nearly 300 different types of COVID-19 vaccines are being developed worldwide and several experimental COVID-19 vaccines may be given EUA status in the near future.\n\nU.S. Emergency Use Authorization does not mean that the FDA has evaluated all safety and efficacy data. Notably, in July 2021 the CDC reported that the fully vaccinated could still become infected and be capable of transmitting the virus to others and data from Israel reported vaccine effectiveness for the experimental Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be as low as 39 percent. While EUA status granted by the FDA to facilitates access to vaccines in a public health emergency, this status shields vaccine manufacturers and providers from liability under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). Under federal law, EUA vaccine recipients must “have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine” and be informed of its risks.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nSARS-CoV-2 & COVID-19\n\nA few coronavirus strains can cause very severe respiratory disease with significant mortality, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in China in 2002-2003 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in China in late 2019 and declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, has a much lower mortality rate than SARS or MERS.\n\nand Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in China in late 2019 and declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, has a much lower mortality rate than SARS or MERS. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2020 about 94 percent of COVID-19 related-deaths occurred in persons over age 65 and individuals with underlying poor health conditions. Among those the CDC consider to be at highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease are the immunocompromised; pregnant women; individuals with chronic heart, lung or kidney disease; the obese; type 2 diabetics; and individuals with cancer, Down’s syndrome, sickle cell disease and thalassemia. There are other chronic health conditions that might increase risks for severe COVID-19 disease, including asthma, high blood pressure, dementia and neurologic conditions, liver disease, cystic fibrosis, and type 1 diabetes.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccine\n\nOn August 23, 2021 the FDA licensed and granted EUA status to Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine, an mRNA vaccine developed BioNTech, for use in persons 16 years of age and older. The FDA also stated that use of Comirnaty and the experimental Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are interchangeable due to having the same formulation. Following FDA approval, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of the 2-dose vaccine series in persons 16 years of age and older.\n\nThe FDA also stated that use of Comirnaty and the experimental Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are interchangeable due to having the same formulation.

There are three experimental COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in December 2020 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in persons 16 years of age and older and 18 years of age and older, respectively. In May of 2021 the experimental Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was additionally authorized by the FDA for use in children and young as 12 years of age with a third dose authorized for the immunocompromised. In February 2021, Janssen Biotech, Inc. of Johnson & Johnson, was granted an EUA by the FDA for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a human adenovirus vector, for use in persons 18 years of age and older.\n\nClick to read more COVID-19 Quick Facts…\n\nLearn More About SARS-CoV-2 Virus and COVID-19 Vaccine NVIC encourages you to become fully informed about SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 vaccine by reading all sections in the Table of Contents below, which contain many links and resources such as the manufacturer product information inserts, and to speak with one or more trusted health care professionals before making a vaccination decision for yourself or your child.

        "HPV: The Disease\n\nHuman papillomaviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses found in the squamous epithelial cells on the surface of the skin and also the mucous membranes of the body. There are more than 200 known types of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) and most are not harmful. In the majority of cases, the human immune system clears HPV infections without symptoms or complications.\n\nMore than 90 percent of those who become infected naturally clear the infection from the body within two years. Antibodies to the HPV type causing the infection remain in the body to help prevent future infections but the protection may not be life-long. Learn more about HPV…\n\nHPV Vaccine\n\nThere are three FDA licensed HPV vaccines, however only one, Gardasil 9, approved in 2014 and manufactured by Merck, is currently available in the United States. Initially, HPV vaccines were given as a series of three shots over 6 months to protect against HPV infection and the health problems that ongoing HPV infection can cause. In 2016 the CDC recommended a two-dose series with second dose administration between 6 to 12 months from the first dose. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Some people who get HPV vaccine have no side effects at all. Some people report having very mild side effects, like a sore arm from the shot.

        "Story Summary Most coronaviruses cause mild symptoms like the common cold;\n\n\n\nMany assumptions have been made about COVID-19 vaccine use;\n\n\n\nParents may not be receiving accurate vaccine risk information;\n\n\n\nSeverity of disease in chidren is rare;\n\n\n\nChildren are being targeted for COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nEven though fathers are spending more time sharing the raising of children with mothers today, 1 national surveys show that women with minor children still remain the primary childcare givers in America.2 3 The ones who usually take children to doctors, mothers are on the front line soon expected to make decisions about giving babies as young as six months old the new genetically engineered Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine when the FDA predictably approves it for emergency use this spring. 4 5\n\nPublic health officials want doctors to give the mRNA vaccine, which forces the body’s cells to manufacture the SARS-COV-2 spike protein, to the most vulnerable age group, 6 the tiny babies and young children under five years old, whose immune systems and brains are not yet fully developed. 7 8 9 It is an age group that mothers historically have been the most responsible for nurturing and protecting from harm.\n\nFastest Development and Mass Administration of An Experimental Vaccine in History\n\nThe targeting of infants and toddlers for COVID vaccination comes two years after the US government declared a coronavirus public health emergency in January 2020 10 and then gave Pfizer and six other drug companies $9 billion dollars to manufacture a coronavirus vaccine at warp speed. 11 Most vaccines take at least 10 years to go through the development and testing licensing process before being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for distribution. 12 Pfizer spent just 248 days testing their experimental COVID vaccine using a never-before licensed technology, which injects synthetic mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles into the body to induce cells to make the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and become - in the words of the World Economic Forum - “vaccine production plants.” 13 14\n\nIn December 2020, the FDA granted Pfizer and its German corporation partner BioNTech, an Emergency Use Authorization – or EUA - to release the unlicensed mRNA vaccine for use by every person over 16 years old. 15 16 That EUA was quickly followed six months later by one for children as young as 12,17 then five months later with authorization for children as young as five. 18\n\nIt is the fastest development and mass administration of an experimental vaccine to healthy humans in history, 19 and the first vaccine to be distributed and recommended for mass use under an Emergency Use Authorization.20 Although the FDA fully licensed Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine in August 2021 as “safe, pure and potent” for 16 year olds, 21 it still is not officially licensed for children younger than that.\n\nFDA’s Emergency Use Authorization of COVID Vaccine Comes with Large Assumptions\n\nBy February 2022, only about 55 percent of children over age 12 in America had gotten two doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, while just 30 percent of five to 11 year-olds had received at least one dose.22 Perhaps mothers are not impressed with the dodgy rationale FDA officials used to justify handing Pfizer an EUA using vague language with large assumptions like it is “reasonable to believe” the vaccine “may be effective” and “reasonable to conclude based on the totality of the scientific evidence available” that the “known and potential benefits...outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.” 23\n\nThose kinds of sweeping caveats clearly demonstrate that an EUA allows a lower standard for scientific evidence of the product’s safety and effectiveness than full licensure. 24 In fact, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the Pfizer COVID vaccine is still an investigational product, still experimental whenever it is given to a child under 16 years old. 25 26\n\nSo far, parents in America are split down the middle when it comes to the idea of giving young children Pfizer’s new COVID-19 vaccine. Half of parents 27 are uncomfortable with injecting synthetic mRNA coated in lipid nanoparticles into the cells of their child’s body, which is supposed to prevent a bad case of COVID disease – but not necessarily prevent their child from being infected with the virus and transmitting it to others. 28 29 With researchers finding that many SARS-CoV-2 infections in young children are asymptomatic and go undetected, 30 and with evidence that natural immunity from infection is broad and persistent, 31 32 parents are asking legitimate questions about why their young children are candidates for this vaccine.\n\nA recent survey found that half of parents were worried about (1) whether the vaccine has been studied long enough in children; (2) whether there are long term side effects; (3) whether the vaccine’s experimental mRNA technology is safe; (4) whether the vaccines work, and (5) the effect of short-term side effects.33 Research published in February 2022 revealed that one third of parents say they will “wait and see” before vaccinating a child under five years old and 26 percent say they will “definitely not” allow their infant or toddler to receive the COVID vaccine. 34\n\nWith the majority of parents worried about whether Pfizer’s COVID vaccine carries unacceptable risks, is effective, or is necessary for their child, what kind of information about COVID disease and the vaccine is being given to mothers taking children to pediatricians around the country?\n\nAre Mothers Being Given Accurate, Complete Information About COVID Vaccine?\n\nIs the information accurate and complete?\n\nAre pediatricians treating mothers with respect and allowing them to exercise voluntary informed consent to COVID vaccination on behalf of a minor child, or are mothers being threatened and punished if they say, “no thanks?” 35 How many doctors plan to deny medical care to children when their mothers decline the COVID vaccine?\n\nA 2020 study reported that more than half of US pediatricians refuse to care for a child if their mothers decline to give the child even one of the four dozen doses of other vaccines CDC officials insist all children must get before age six. 36 37 38 39 To stop mothers from being able to exercise informed consent to vaccination on behalf of their children, medical trade associations have lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving doctors permission to extract consent for any type of vaccination from children as young as 11 years old without the knowledge of their parents 40 and, in 2020, the District of Columbia was the first to pass that kind of law. 41 42 Five states (Alabama, Oregon, South Carolina, North Carolina and Rhode Island) have passed laws to give doctors the power to persuade children between 14 and 16 years old to get COVID vaccine without telling parents. 43\n\nIf you cringe thinking about whether your 11 year old or teenager is intellectually, psychologically and emotionally equipped to accurately weigh the potential benefits and risks of a vaccine and resist the pressure from a doctor telling them what to do, 44 you are not alone.\n\nAs a co-founder of the charitable National Vaccine Information Center established in 1982 to prevent vaccine injuries and deaths through public education, 45 I have never been more concerned about a new vaccine the government wants doctors to give to every infant and child. As a mother of three and now a grandmother, as a college-educated woman who completely trusted my pediatrician when I took my healthy two and a half year old son for a DPT shot in 1980 and then watched him suffer a convulsion, collapse and brain inflammation reaction that put him in a special education classroom, 46 I urge all mothers to become fully informed about the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 vaccine before making a vaccination decision for a child of any age.\n\nAll Vaccines Come with Two Risks\n\nVaccines are pharmaceutical products that come with two risks: a risk the vaccine will cause a reaction that could cause harm, and a risk the vaccine will fail to protect against infection and transmission of a disease that could cause harm. Because we are all individuals born with different genes and environmental influences, the risks for disease complications or vaccine complications can be greater for some, depending upon genetic, epigenetic, environmental and other biological factors unique to the individual. 47 48 49 50\n\nIf the risks of COVID vaccination turn out to be 100 percent for your child – whether it is because the vaccine causes a severe reaction or fails to prevent severe complications of the disease – you should know that in June 2020, Congress completely shielded vaccine manufacturers and anyone administering the COVID vaccine from product liability and malpractice lawsuits in civil court. 51 52 So whatever happens, you will be on your own.\n\nAt the National Vaccine information Center, we do not make vaccine use recommendations, but we do defend without compromise the human right to exercise voluntary, informed consent to medical risk taking. 53 You have the moral right and should have the legal right to accept or refuse a vaccine for yourself or your minor child without being sanctioned in any way. 54\n\nThis commentary offers an overview of COVID disease and the vaccine, with a focus on the genetically engineered messenger mRNA COVID vaccine manufactured by Pfizer being recommended for children by federal government officials and medical trade associations in the U.S. I encourage you to check out the library of over 200 live-linked references anchoring this commentary on NVIC.org to verify the content and do your own research.\n\nMost Coronaviruses Cause Mild Symptoms Like the Common Cold\n\nCoronaviruses are a group of diverse, single stranded RNA viruses that have been around for thousands of years and infect animals, as well as humans. Coronaviruses usually cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms like those of the common cold,55 with the exception of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in China in 2002, and the coronavirus causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) identified in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 - both of which had high mortality rates.56\n\nAbout 20 percent of cold or flu-like upper respiratory infections each year are caused by coronaviruses and there is evidence that many people already have at least partial natural immunity to common coronavirus infections. Some researchers think this may be one reason why the current SARS-CoV-2 infection is asymptomatic or mild for most healthy children and many adults, 57 and why COVID-19 tests can generate false positive results because the tests pick up evidence of previous coronavirus infections. 58 59\n\nDisagreement About Origins of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID Vaccine Effectiveness and Safety\n\nSince early 2020, public health officials have insisted that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spontaneously jumped into a human out of a bat at a wet food market in China and the only way to end the pandemic is to lock down, mask up, and require everyone to be vaccinated. 60 61 62 63 64 65 There are prominent scientists, doctors, ethicists, attorneys, lawmakers and journalists around the world, who disagree with that view. They point out there is compelling evidence:\n\nthat the SARS-CoV-2 virus was created in a lab and top health officials did not want the public to know about it; 66 67 68 69\n\nthat fast tracked mRNA COVID vaccines have not been thoroughly tested by drug companies, which have failed to release all the clinical trial data, and both the companies and public health officials are downplaying serious vaccine-related reactions and deaths; 70 71 72 73 74 75 76\n\nthat the most widely-used mRNA COVID manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna may prevent serious disease complications, but vaccinated people can still get infected with and transmit the new coronavirus to other people, 77 and any temporary protection from COVID disease wanes quickly after vaccination; 78\n\nand any temporary protection from COVID disease wanes quickly after vaccination; that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is mostly asymptomatic or mild in healthy children and young adults 79 and that naturally acquired immunity is equal to or broader and longer lasting than COVID vaccine acquired artificial immunity; 80 81 82 83 and\n\nand that naturally acquired immunity is equal to or broader and longer lasting than COVID vaccine acquired artificial immunity; and that governments have done more harm than good by locking down societies and creating masking and vaccine mandates; 84 85 86 87 88 89 90\n\nHere are four questions you need to keep in mind when you are making a COVID-19 vaccine decision for your minor child:\n\n1. HOW SERIOUS IS COVID-19 DISEASE IN CHILDREN?\n\nBy February 2022, the new coronavirus had evolved from the original alpha variant that human populations had no immunological experience with, to the more transmissible and severe Delta variant that emerged in the summer of 2021, to the Omicron variant that became dominant in late 2021. 91 Omicron is highly contagious but causes fewer complications and hospitalizations than Delta, 92 and there is speculation that the fact so many people have developed various degrees of natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is one reason why hospitalizations and deaths are coming down in the U.S. 93 94\n\nAs of Feb. 14, 2022, COVID-19 death rates reported by states in the previous seven days ranged from 0.26 to about 1.5 deaths per 100,000 people.95 To put the worst case 1.5 COVID-related deaths per 100,000 people rate into perspective, the annual death rate for some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. in 2014 were: 193 deaths per 100,000 for heart disease; 186 per 100,000 for cancer; 46 per 100,000 for chronic respiratory disease; 24 per 100,000 for diabetes; 15 per 100,000 for drug overdoses. 96\n\nSerious COVID-19 Complications Usually Occur in People Over 65 with Chronic Health Problems\n\nAt the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, it became obvious that most of the serious complications of COVID-19 disease leading to hospitalizations and death do not occur in children or healthy young adults, but in people over age 65, especially if they have one or more chronic health problems. In 2020, researchers projected that about 45 percent of the U.S. adult population was at increased risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infections because of underlying heart or respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer. 97\n\nOne big study sponsored by the CDC looked at the connection between underlying medical conditions and severe illness among more than 500,000 adults with COVID-19 admitted to 800 US hospitals in 2020 and 2021. Researchers found that 95 percent of adult COVID patients had at least one underlying poor health condition like high blood pressure and obesity. 98 The strongest risk factors for death were obesity, anxiety and fear disorders, and diabetes with complications.\n\nChildren with chronic health problems are also at risk for COVID disease complications. The CDC states on its website that, “In the United States, more than 40% of school-aged children and adolescents have at least one chronic health condition, such as asthma, obesity, other physical conditions, and behavior/learning problems.” 99\n\nMost Serious COVID-19 Complications Occur in Children with Underlying Chronic Conditions\n\nA large cross-sectional study funded by the CDC examined the health records of more than 43,000 patients under the age of 18 with a COVID diagnosis who visited the emergency room or were admitted to 900 US hospitals in 2020 or January 2021. 100 The median age of child COVID patients was 12 years old. Researchers found that about 29 percent of the child COVID patients had underlying chronic conditions like asthma; obesity; and neurodevelopmental, depressive, anxiety and fear-related disorders. The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes and obesity. The strongest risk factors for severe COVID illness were type 1 diabetes and congenital cardiac and circulatory problems. Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID illness in children under two years old. 101 Those with a COVID diagnosis represented only about 1 percent of all children who visited an emergency room or were admitted to the hospital.\n\nMore than 81% of COVID related deaths in the U.S. have occurred in seniors over age 65 and deaths in that age group are 80 times higher than for people between 18 and 29.102 The COVID case fatality rate for children by February 2022 was measured at less than one percent in the U.S.103\n\nStudies Show Most Healthy Infants and Children Have Either No or Mild COVID Disease Symptoms\n\nStudies have shown that most healthy infants and children with COVID disease either have no symptoms or much milder symptoms than adults, which last about a week. 104 COVID disease symptoms in the majority of healthy children are similar to a cold or flu-like illness and range from fever, sore throat, fatigue and body aches to runny nose and congestion, headache, cough, nausea and diarrhea. As with most respiratory diseases, pneumonia is always a risk and, clearly, risks for COVID complications are higher for children with certain types of underlying chronic disease. 105\n\nSevere complications of COVID-19 disease in some individuals appear to involve a hyper-inflammatory response by the immune system to infection with SARS-CoV-2. This can lead to cytokine storm involving elevated levels of circulating cytokines and immune-cell hyperactivation that can lead to severe respiratory distress and death if the inflammation does not resolve. 106 There is a condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that has been reported rarely, and obese children are most at risk. Symptoms include a prolonged fever, unusual fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, red skin rash, abdominal pain, red lips and eyes and swollen hands or feet.107\n\nChildren Who Get COVID Have Very Low Risk for Hospitalization, Long COVID or Death\n\nWhile the majority of people diagnosed with COVID disease have mild to moderate symptoms, about 10 to 15 percent become severely ill and five percent become critically ill. Most recover in two to three weeks, but researchers estimate about one in five may have symptoms for five or more weeks and one in 10 people will have symptoms that last for 12 weeks or longer. 108 Symptoms of “long Covid,” can include fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, cough, chest pain, altered smell and taste, diarrhea, difficulty thinking clearly, memory loss, anxiety and sleep disorders. About four percent of children may experience “long Covid” symptoms like fatigue, headache and loss of smell and the majority recover within eight weeks. 109\n\nIf infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, healthy children have a very low risk of being hospitalized or dying. A U.S. state data report published by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Feb. 3, 2022 found that out of about 1.2 million COVID-related hospitalizations, only three percent were children. Out of 821,369 reported COVID deaths in the U.S., 828 of those deaths or .01 percent were in children.110\n\n2. ARE THERE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO PREVENT OR TREAT COMPLICATIONS OF COVID DISEASE?\n\nOne of the great tragedies of the coronavirus pandemic over the past two years has been that very few drugs and effective medical protocols have been approved by the government to help people prevent or recover from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. About 95 percent of the public funds appropriated by the U.S. and other governments to fund the global response to the coronavirus pandemic were given to multi-national drug companies to develop and deliver vaccines, while only five percent was spent on exploring therapies to treat COVID disease.111 There are still very few FDA-approved drugs or therapies available for doctors to treat COVID disease.\n\nMost of the anti-viral COVID drugs approved by the FDA under an EUA are very expensive, 112 113 114 and there are unanswered questions about risks and whether they work very well.115 116 117 118 In early 2020, practicing physicians searching for ways to help people with COVID began repurposing already licensed drugs for off-label use, a common practice that has been allowed under FDA law for many years. 119\n\nSome Doctors Use Repurposed Licensed Drugs to Treat COVID\n\nSome of the more affordable licensed drugs that have been repurposed by physicians to treat COVID over the past two years include the Nobel award winning anti-parasitic, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drug Ivermectin. 120 121 122 123 124 125 Vitamins, minerals and supplements that have been used to help prevent or address COVID complications include the Vitamins D, 126 127 C, 128 and B complex; 129 magnesium; 130 quercetin; 131 132 melatonin, 133 curcumin, 134 zinc, 135 NAC, 136 probiotics, 137 Omega 3s, 138 glutathione 139 and aspirin. 140\n\nAs with all drugs and supplements, it is important to have a knowledgeable doctor direct treatment in the appropriate doses and for the right length of time, because what may work and is safe at one stage of the disease may not be during another stage. The Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCCA) 141 and World Council for Health. 142 are two groups of doctors who have developed COVID-19 treatment protocols that are not endorsed by government health officials but are being used by a number of health professionals around the world to treat adults and children with COVID.\n\nHigh Mortality Rate for COVID Patients Hospitalized in US\n\nWith an average 38 percent mortality rate for seriously ill COVID patients admitted to U.S. hospitals in 2020,143 and with COVID patients who are put on a ventilator experiencing a 45 to 85 percent mortality rate, 144 145 146 it is no wonder independent doctors have been exploring options for reducing COVID complications and keeping patients out of hospitals. Yet, these doctors are being criticized by public health officials discouraging the use of repurposed licensed drugs like Ivermectin 147 and over-the-counter supplements 148 that peer reviewed studies have shown either prevent severe disease and improve, or have the potential to improve, survival. 149 Medical boards in some states are trying remove the medical licenses from those doctors, 150 and it can be difficult to find a doctor in the U.S. willing to depart from the few government approved medical protocols for treating COVID. 151\n\nThe National Institutes of Health warns that:152\n\n“Research hasn’t clearly shown that any dietary supplement helps prevent COVID-19 or can decrease the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Only vaccines and medications can prevent COVID-19 and treat its symptoms.”\n\nNo Drugs Specifically Approved by FDA for Treatment of COVID-19 in Children\n\nThe only guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control for treatment of children with COVID are dated December 2020 and state, “Currently, there are no drugs specifically approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19 in children.” 153 NIH has a child treatment guide, which states that “Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection will not require any specific therapy” and “There are limited data on the pathogenesis and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease in children.” It goes on to say that:\n\n“There are no pediatric data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and limited data from observational studies to inform the development of pediatric-specific recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19.” 154\n\nAfter lockdowns and forced masking and a year that saw many Americans subjected to mandatory COVID vaccination to enter public spaces and keep their jobs, it is very sad that government officials have done so little to investigate and approve therapies to address COVID disease. One political explanation is that under FDA regulations, drug companies cannot receive emergency use authorization to distribute fast tracked experimental vaccines (or drugs) if there are “adequate, approved, and available alternatives.” 155\n\n3. HOW EFFECTIVE IS PFIZER’S COVID VACCINE?\n\nAfter the coronavirus pandemic was declared by public health officials in early 2020 and governments asked drug companies to fast track development of experimental COVID vaccines, the FDA issued guidelines assuring the companies that vaccine trials would only have to demonstrate “at least 50 percent” efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19 disease. There was no requirement for companies to prove their COVID vaccines prevent infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 156 157 Perhaps that is one reason why the vaccines are called COVID vaccines and not SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n\nBut the general public did not and still does not understand the difference. That is because for more than a century, people have been carefully taught to believe that a vaccine produces artificial immunity in the body to prevent transmission of contagious diseases to other people. 158\n\nCDC Changed Definition of “Vaccine” and “Vaccination” to Remove Reference to “Immunity”\n\nCDC officials frequently have referred to vaccines as “immunizations.” 159 But in 2021, the CDC suddenly changed its definition of “vaccine” from “a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease” to “a preparation that is used to stimulate the body’s immune response against diseases.” 160 The Merriam Webster Dictionary also changed its definition of “vaccine” to eliminate the concept that a vaccine stimulates “immunity” and replaced it with the concept that vaccines create an “immune response.”161\n\nUp until now, the words “vaccine” and “vaccination” have been synonymous with creating “artificial immunity” in humans and animals. 162 The rewriting of that definition to admit that vaccines cannot be presumed to confer immunity - only modify the person’s immune response - is stunning because mandatory vaccination laws historically have been based on the common belief that all infants and children must get vaccinated to create “herd immunity” and prevent the transmission of contagious diseases within a community.163 164\n\nIf the definition of “vaccine” and “vaccination” no longer includes the concept of immunity, 165 then the definitions of vaccine “efficacy” and “effectiveness” have been forever changed as well.166 167\n\nPublic Misled Into Believing that Pfizer COVID Vaccine Reliably Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission\n\nTo obtain the EUA in late 2020, Pfizer published clinical trial data involving about 43,000 participants over age 16, with more than 21,000 of them injected with the company’s experimental mRNA Covid vaccine. Pfizer said the data showed that two doses of the vaccine achieved a 95 percent efficacy for preventing severe COVID disease.168 169 Most mainstream media reports publicizing the Pfizer clinical trial results misled the public into believing that a 95 percent “efficacy” rate meant the vaccine reliably prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection. 170 Americans obeying mask mandates put into place before the vaccine was released, assumed that they would be able to ditch the mask and stop social distancing once they got vaccinated. 171\n\nBut in early 2021 when CDC officials did not back away from mask mandates for vaccinated persons, people started suspecting something was wrong about that assumption. Fully vaccinated people were told to keep the masks on and socially distance like unvaccinated people. 172\n\nThe logical question was: why do fully vaccinated people have to worry about getting infected or infecting other people?\n\nThe answer to that question became obvious when study after study published in the medical literature since December 2020 showed that two or three doses of Pfizer’s mRNA COVID vaccine does not reliably prevent symptomatic or asymptomatic infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the vaccine has a very short shelf life for protection against COVID disease, waning within a few months of vaccination. 173 174 175 While that reality sets in, studies are revealing that naturally acquired immunity from the new coronavirus infection is broad and long lasting, 176 177 178 179 180 perhaps two years or more. 181\n\nMore COVID Booster Shots or Annual Re-Vaccination?\n\nIn fact, within four months of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine being approved by FDA for distribution, in April 2021 the company’s CEO called for a third shot – a booster dose – and suggested it was possible vaccinated people would have to get revaccinated every year. 182 Seven months later, the FDA dutifully approved the Pfizer booster shot for emergency use by everyone over 18 years old, 183 and on Jan. 3, 2022, expanded the EUA to allow a third booster shot for children as young as 12 years old. 184\n\nNow there is talk about a fourth booster shot. 185 And the Pfizer CEO is once again calling for annual COVID vaccinations in the future. 186\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2022, Pfizer applied for an EUA to give its COVID vaccine to infants and young children between six months and five years old. 187 But, within 10 days, the request was suddenly withdrawn after indications that two three microgram doses of the vaccine did not prevent COVID disease symptoms in that age group and a third dose would be required to demonstrate efficacy. 188 189\n\n4. HOW REACTIVE IS THE PFIZER VACCINE AND ARE THERE SERIOUS RISKS?\n\nAfter the FDA gave emergency use permission to Pfizer in December 2020 to distribute their COVID vaccine, the nonprofit group Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the FDA to immediately release 450,000 pages of Pfizer vaccine testing data that the agency relied upon to grant the EUA. FDA officials refused the request, claiming it would take them 75 years to release all the trial data to the public. A lawsuit was filed and, on Jan 6, 2022, a Texas federal judge ordered the FDA to release 55,000 pages every 30 days until all the requested pages were made public. 190\n\nThe need for full public disclosure was reinforced by an allegation by a whistleblower, who had worked for a subcontractor involved in the first COVID vaccine clinical trial Pfizer conducted in 2020. She charged that there were serious irregularities in the trial, including falsification of data, lack of monitoring of trial participants after vaccination and failure to immediately follow up of patients who experienced adverse events. 191\n\nQuestions About Pfizer COVID Vaccine Safety Testing, Lack of Transparency\n\nPfizer has been haunted by questions about what it does and does not know about the reactivity and long-term side effects of its COVID vaccine ever since the FDA granted emergency use authorization after only nine months of testing. 192 193 194 To demonstrate safety, drug companies historically have been required to first test the experimental vaccine for toxicity in animals, followed up by Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials to test the vaccine on a few hundred volunteers for detection of common side effects; then progress to Phase 3 trials that involve thousands of people to further identify potential serious reactions. 195 Although Pfizer did publish a few small animal studies testing its mRNA COVID vaccine on mice, rats and monkeys, most of the focus was on showing the vaccine was effective, not that it was safe. 196 197 198 199\n\nTo speed up the COVID vaccine testing process, FDA allowed Pfizer and other drug companies to conduct some of the animal and human clinical studies simultaneously, instead of sequentially. 200 201 To further accelerate approval, FDA also allowed companies to provide testing data from previous research on other types of experimental mRNA vaccines as preliminary proof that COVID mRNA vaccines were effective and safe, even though those other mRNA vaccines were never licensed. 202\n\nMajority of Participants in Pfizer COVID Vaccine Clinical Trials Experienced Local or Systemic Adverse Events\n\nIn December 2020, Pfizer published results of a Phase 2/3 randomized saline placebo controlled human clinical trial in a bid to be the first company to obtain Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to distribute a COVID vaccine for mass use. The company tested two 30 microgram doses of the vaccine given 21 days apart to about 21,700 healthy volunteers aged 16 and older who had not been previously diagnosed with COVID, and followed them up for between seven days and several months after the second dose to identify common and serious adverse events. 203 The majority of vaccinated participants experienced a local or systemic reaction, with younger people more often reporting side effects like pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, fever and swollen lymph glands that occurred more often after the second dose and lasted for several days but then resolved, according to Pfizer. The few serious adverse events recorded after vaccination in the trial, such as cardiac arrythmia and a death from cardiac arrest, were dismissed by investigators as unrelated to the vaccine. 204\n\nIn 2021, Pfizer published results of Phase 2/3 clinical trials testing two 30 microgram doses of its COVID vaccine on about 1,100 healthy 12 to 15 year olds, 205 and another one that tested two 10 microgram doses on about 1,500 healthy five to 11 year olds, who had never been diagnosed with COVID.206 The children were followed up for seven days, one month and six months. For the five to 11 year old children in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial who got the Pfizer COVID vaccine, researchers reduced the dose from 30 micrograms to 10 micrograms in an effort to lower the incidence of systemic reactions like fever.\n\nOn the CDC website in a summary of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reactions and adverse events, the CDC states that within seven days of vaccination over 90 percent of study participants aged 12 to 15 years reported at least one local or systemic reaction and among child study participants aged 5 to 11 years old, about 86 percent reported at least one local reaction and about 66 percent reported at least one systemic reaction like fever, chills, fatigue, headache, new or worsened muscle pain or swollen lymph nodes. 207\n\nPfizer Unblinded COVID Vaccine Trials and Vaccinated Placebo Participants\n\nAlthough Pfizer says it plans to follow up clinical trial participants of all ages for two years, by March 2021 the company had unblinded the study and offered the COVID vaccine to placebo participants, which scientifically compromises evaluations and comparisons of long-term health problems in vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. 208 209 The unblinding of a clinical trial while follow up of participants is ongoing has never been done before – it is unprecedented.210\n\nIn those Phase 2-3 trials, including a six-month follow-up trial, 211 and from anecdotal experiences reported by those who have gotten the Pfizer vaccine,212 it is obvious that the mRNA COVID vaccine is quite reactive. The majority of vaccinated people, especially if they are younger and after receiving a second dose, 213 experience acute reactions like injection site pain, fever, headache, fatigue, swollen lymph glands and body discomfort sometimes severe enough to require a day or two of recovery, which can include needing to stay home from work.214 One CDC official commented early on that, “People should be prepared to have pain” following vaccination, suggesting that pain is a sign that “It’s your body building an immune response to the protein that is mimicking the disease.\" 215\n\nOther doctors point out that strong reaction symptoms like high fevers, chills, headache, joint and muscle aching, and disabling fatigue are evidence of an inflammatory response mounted by the innate immune system and that antibodies are later generated by the adaptive part of the immune system.216 217 It has long been recognized that strong reactions to pharmaceutical products can be a reason to exercise caution, especially with repeat doses. 218 219 220 221 222\n\nSerious Blood, Cardiac and Brain Disorders Develop After Pfizer COVID Vaccinations\n\nSince the Pfizer vaccine was released under an EUA, there have been serious blood, cardiac and brain disorders reported in the medical literature, and also by people who have received the vaccine. 223 224 225 226 Among the more serious are immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 227 which causes internal bleeding because the immune system attacks platelets and the blood cannot clot; heart inflammation that can cause a variety of cardiac problems; 228 and immune mediated inflammatory neurological disorders 229 230 like Guillain Barre Syndrome, 231 Bell’s Palsy 232 and Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis. 233 234\n\nCDC officials have acknowledged only two major serious reactions related to Comirnaty vaccine: (1) anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction also known as shock that has symptoms like trouble breathing, swelling of the tongue and throat, hives and drop in blood pressure; 235 236 and (2) heart inflammation, which is commonly diagnosed as myocarditis or pericarditis with symptoms like chest pain, fast beating, fluttering or pounding heart and shortness of breath. 237\n\nInflammation of the Heart (Myocarditis/Pericarditis) Reported After Pfizer COVID Vaccinations\n\nInflammation of the heart is not a trivial complication, whether it is caused by an infection or a vaccine. Myocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle and is more often seen in infants and teenagers, but can occur at any age, especially after a viral infection. 238 Myocarditis and pericarditis, which is inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, are thought to be largely immune-mediated and in serious cases, can lead to heart rhythm disorders, heart damage, heart failure and death.\n\nEvery year, heart disease kills nearly 660,000 Americans – one in four. It is the leading cause of death in the United States among men and women of all races, costing the nation 363 billion dollars a year. 239\n\nMyocarditis is a known complication of smallpox vaccine 240 and has been reported after influenza vaccine 241 and now is being reported after the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 242 243 A controlled study using large national healthcare databases from the US Department of Veterans Affairs found that individuals who had acute COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of many types of cardiovascular problems, including myocarditis and pericarditis; heart rhythm disorders; heart failure; ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease that can cause stroke and thromboembolic disease, or deep vein thrombosis involving blood clots. 244 Although researchers said the greatest risk for COVID-related heart inflammation was in unvaccinated persons, the myocarditis risks were increased even for vaccinated people who got COVID.\n\nA descriptive study conducted by CDC researchers analyzed reports to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database from December 2020 to August 2021 and found that crude reporting rates of myocarditis within seven days of mRNA vaccinations were higher than expected across multiple age groups and in both women and men. 245 The rates of myocarditis cases were highest after the second dose in adolescent males, with about 70 cases of myocarditis reported per million doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine in 12 to 15 year old males and about 106 myocarditis cases per million doses in males 16 to 17 years old. Most myocarditis symptoms appeared to occur and resolve more quickly after vaccination than after viral illness. Still, the researchers admitted that, “the risks and outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are unclear.”\n\nBlood Clotting and Blood Vessel Disorders Reported After Pfizer COVID Vaccinations\n\nBlood clotting and blood vessel disorders have also been reported after receiving Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine. One self-controlled case series study looked at patient records of 29 million people vaccinated in England and hospitalized between December 2020 and April 2021. Nine million patients in the health records database got the Pfizer vaccine and researchers discovered an increased risk for blood clotting and blood vessel disorders within 15 to 21 days of vaccination that can lead to death. 246 The conclusion was that after receiving the Pfizer COVID mRNA vaccine, there are increased risks for arterial thromboembolism, which is a blood clot in an artery that stops the flow of blood to an organ or another part of the body; 247 and for ischemic stroke, which is when a blood clot cuts off blood supply to the brain and brain cells begin to die within minutes; 248 and for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is when a blood clot forms in the brain’s venous sinuses and prevents blood from draining out of the brain. 249 The researchers pointed out that these blood clotting and blood vessel disorders also are complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections and occur more frequently in seriously ill patients testing positive for COVID than after COVID vaccination.\n\nOver One Million COVID Vaccine Reaction Reports Filed with U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)\n\nAs of Feb. 4, 2022, there were over 1.1 million adverse event reports following COVID-19 vaccinations filed with the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System known as VAERS that was created under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.250 251 252 253 COVID vaccine-related reaction reports represent more than 50 percent of the nearly two million total adverse event reports that have been made to VAERS for all federally recommended vaccines since the vaccine reaction reporting system became operational in 1990. It is estimated that only between one and 10 percent of vaccine adverse events that occur in the U.S. are reported to VAERS. 254 255\n\nUsing MedAlerts, an independent search engine for VAERS established in 2003, I conducted a search the first week in February 2022 and found that about 624,000 of the COVID vaccine adverse event reports were associated with the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine, 256 including over 130,000 events categorized as “serious,” 257 and about 15,500 deaths. 258 259 A portion of these reports have been filed by residents of other countries who have received the Pfizer COVID vaccine, and federal health officials warn that there is no proof of causation for any given vaccine adverse event report filed with VAERS. 260\n\nIf your doctor refuses to report a serious health problem following vaccination to VAERS that you or your child have suffered, go to NVIC.org to learn how you can report it yourself.\n\nVery Strong Inflammatory Responses Associated with mRNA COVID Vaccine\n\nWhat is it about the Pfizer mRNA vaccine that makes it so reactive?\n\nBecause the Comirnaty vaccine was fast tracked to licensure and all animal and human clinical trial data have not been fully released to the public, there has been speculation about the potential biological mechanisms for vaccine induced inflammatory disorders affecting the heart vessels and brain and other parts of the body.\n\nThe main concern about the Comirnaty vaccine’s reactivity is centered on the fact it uses a new mRNA technology platform that pushes synthetic mRNA coated with lipid nanoparticles into the body’s cells to force cells to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This is the first mRNA vaccine injected into humans on a mass basis and the first one using a lipid nanoparticle delivery system. 261\n\nA search of the medical literature and mainstream media articles quickly reveals that two years before Pfizer and Moderna got an EUA to distribute their mRNA vaccines, academic researchers warned of potential safety issues with the platform, like local and systemic inflammation; stimulation of hyper-inflammatory immune responses causing chronic inflammation and autoimmunity; 262 and the presence of extracellular RNA that may cause edema and the formation of blood clots. 263 The lipid nanoparticles that coat the synthetic mRNA in COVID vaccines can be highly inflammatory, as one recent study in mice demonstrated. 264 265 This is the first human vaccine to include lipid nanoparticles and there are outstanding questions about biodistribution in the body and if they can accumulate in different organs of the body like the liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys and perhaps crosses the blood brain barrier. 266 267 268 269 270\n\nThere has been a debate about whether lipid nanoparticle coated mRNA that provokes cells to generate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ends up in the ovaries and could potentially affect fertility, with one of the inventors of mRNA technology and other scientists saying it could happen and other scientists saying it cannot. 271 272 At the same time there is an investigation going on in Europe about menstrual irregularities and spontaneous bleeding in menopausal women who have gotten mRNA vaccines. 273 274\n\nThere are also questions about antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), 275 276 which could make certain people who already have coronavirus antibodies because they got vaccinated or had a previous infection more susceptible to severe COVID disease if they are infected or re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. Public health officials disagree that COVID vaccine can cause antibody dependent enhancement, maintaining that vaccinated people who get COVID have milder, not more severe, disease. 277\n\nQuestions About Few Contraindications, Giving COVID Vaccine with Other Vaccines, Long Term Safety\n\nThere are questions about the almost total absence of contraindications, which means reasons not to give the Comirnaty vaccine, and recommendations to give another dose after a previous reaction. 278 Then there is the lack of published evidence for the blanket recommendation that it is safe to give Comirnaty vaccine at the same time with all other government recommended vaccines. 279 280\n\nAt the end of the day, the biggest safety concern about Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine being given to children is that it just has not been studied long enough to determine if it will negatively affect the long term health of children.\n\nEminent scientists and doctors in the U.S. and around the world have been challenging official narratives about COVID and COVID-19 vaccines and asking all the right questions. 281 282 A U.S. Senator has held panel discussions on Capitol Hill to give a voice to these scientists and to those who have been injured by COVID vaccines or have had their informed consent rights violated. 283 Americans all across the country have been defending civil liberties and informed consent rights in many different kinds of public forums, even as they face censorship and abuse from those who are trying to silence the public conversation about vaccination, health and autonomy. 284 285\n\nConcern About COVID Vaccine Being Mandated for Infants and Children\n\nIn closing, it is important to remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is the 17th vaccine U.S. health officials now direct doctors to give to children as young as five years old. 286 When the FDA gives Pfizer the green light to distribute Comirnaty to children younger than that, the vaccine will be given to six-month old babies. After 40 years of monitoring the science, policy, law and ethics of vaccination, my greatest concern is that this new vaccine eventually will be mandated for all infants and children, just like almost all vaccines that industry has created in the past century have been mandated.\n\nWe are responsible for protecting our children from harm, our children, who are now the most chronically ill and disabled children in the history of our nation. Two in five children between six and 17 years old suffer with some kind of inflammatory immune or brain disorder like asthma, diabetes and epilepsy, 287 and one child in six is developmentally delayed, 288 but there are no credible explanations coming from public health officials for why so many of our children are growing up sick and disabled and face a lifetime of chronic poor health.\n\nDebate About Vaccination Is More Than 200 Years Old\n\nBefore the current public debate about COVID vaccine, there have been public debates about the wisdom of giving children many other vaccines that were very reactive. I joined with parents of DPT vaccine injured children to launch the modern vaccine safety and informed consent movement in 1982 because we wanted the toxic, highly inflammatory whole cell pertussis vaccine that had harmed our children taken off the market. 289 290 We followed mothers and fathers in the 19th century, who protested the reactivity of the smallpox vaccine. 291 292 Our activism in the late 20th century was followed by parents speaking out in the early 1990s about what happened to their children after being given the first genetically engineered vaccine for hepatitis B, 293 294 295 followed by young mothers and fathers in the early 21st century once again asking government, industry and the medical establishment to expand knowledge about vaccine side effects and who is at highest risk. 296 297 298\n\nThe charged debates about flawed vaccine science and the violation of the human rights inherent in mandatory vaccination laws have not changed in two hundred years. The fact that the debate about vaccination will not go away - no matter how much money and political power is thrown at it to make it go away – only confirms the universal need for it.\n\nProtect Your Moral and Legal Right to Make Voluntary Vaccination Decisions\n\nAs a mother, you have the moral right and must have the legal right to gather as much information as you can about COVID disease and the COVID vaccine, consult with a trusted health professional, and then follow your conscience and your gut instincts when making a decision about whether or not your child should get vaccinated - without being coerced or sanctioned by anyone for the decision you make. 299\n\nIf you want to work in your state to protect your legal right to make a voluntary decision about vaccination, go to NVICAdvocacy.org and become a registered user of the free NVIC Advocacy Portal so you can stay informed about good or bad vaccine bills moving in your state and take action. Last year, after NVIC worked with families across the country to successfully hold back state COVID vaccine mandates after the federal government issued strict vaccine mandates for both federal and private company employees, about 20 states passed laws in some way prohibiting COVID vaccine mandates or vaccine passports. Not one state legislature passed a law mandating the COVID vaccine, even as Governors and local state officials in a few states enacted COVID vaccine mandates without getting legislature approval. 300\n\nSign up for NVIC’s texting service and get NVIC’s weekly journal newspaper – The Vaccine Reaction – in your email box to stay up to date on breaking news. 301 Read and download vaccine education information from NVIC.org and share it with your friends, family, legislators and thought leaders in your community.\n\nBe the one who never has to say, you did not do today what you could have done to change tomorrow.\n\nIt’s your health, your family, your choice. And our mission continues: No forced vaccination. Not in America."

        "NYC Mayor Fires Another 200 City Workers Over COVID Jab | 24 July 2022 | New York City Mayor Eric Adams's office revealed on Saturday that city officials fired more than 200 additional city employees for refusing to get vaccinated for COVID -- bringing the total number of firings up to 1,752 workers. The mayor's office told the New York Post those numbers reflect as of July 13. Six months ago, Adams laid off over 1,500 government employees who refused to comply with the city's vaccine mandate Feb 11 deadline... Just after Adams terminated the unvaxxed city staff, he faced backlash from police and fire associations. NBC New York reported Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York, who once estimated up to 500 firefighters would face the risk of termination due to their refusal to comply with the mandate, called out the mayor for exempting New York City-based professional athletes and performers from the citywide mandate."

Such employees who were let go included 914 in the Department of Education, 36 in the New York Police Department, and 25 others from the city’s fire department.\n\nHowever, officials did not provide a list of departments where the city cut the additional 200 jobs.\n\n“City workers served on the frontlines during the pandemic, and by getting vaccinated, they are, once again, showing how they are willing to do the right thing to protect themselves and all New Yorkers,” Adams said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nJust after Adams terminated the unvaxxed city staff, he faced backlash from police and fire associations.\n\nNBC New York reported Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York, who once estimated up to 500 firefighters would face the risk of termination due to their refusal to comply with the mandate, called out the mayor for exempting New York City-based professional athletes and performers from the citywide mandate.\n\n“If you’re gonna force people to get vaccinated because the science changes, you also have to acknowledge that you’re allowing people to have exceptions because the science changes, and it’s no longer necessary,” Ansbro said.\n\nPolice Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch told NBC New York that the union has been suing the city over its arbitrary and capricious vaccine mandate.\n\n“New York City police officers were on the street throughout the pandemic, working without adequate PPE and in many cases contracting and recovering from COVID themselves,” Lynch said. “They don’t deserve to be treated like second-class citizens now.”\n\nLast month, Adams offered city workers who were fired due to the mandate to get rehired by the city if they showed proof of receiving one dose of the vaccine by June 30, with plans to get the second shot by Aug 15. However, the number of former employees who took Adams up on his offer remains unknown.\n\n“Our administration is making a final effort to allow the small number of employees who have been terminated to be rehired so long as they get fully vaccinated,” a spokesman from the mayor’s office told the New York Post, adding his “goal has always been vaccination, rather than termination.”\n\nThe spokesman reports more than 97 percent of city workers were vaccinated.\n\nAs the city continues enforcing vaccines on its workers, officials announced last month the creation of the first Test to Treat program, which provides access to antiviral medications at mobile testing sites for COVID patients.\n\nDuring the introduction, Adams said medication helped him survive COVID-19 when he contracted the virus last April, adding the mobile medicine site would help protect New York City against any new variants of future transmission waves.\n\n“I said this over and over again,” he said. “COVID is a formidable opponent.”\n\n“It pivots and shifts, and we are clear that we are going to pivot and shift with it,” he added.\n\nAdams’ comments come aroud the same time as former White House COVID response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx admitting the vaccines wouldn’t protect against infections while promoting more testing and treatments.\n\n“I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection,” Birx told Fox News. “And I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it’s not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.”\n\nBirx said 50 percent of people who died from the Omicron variant were older and vaccinated.\n\nSo that’s why I’m saying even if you’re vaccinated and boosted, if you’re unvaccinated right now, the key is testing and Paxlovid,” she said. “It’s effective. It’s a great antiviral.”\n\n“And really, that is what’s going to save your lives right now if you’re over 70,” she added.\n\nNew York City employs over 400,000 residents in various government agencies. Outside of the 1,700 city staffers who were recently terminated, more than 6,000 others have applied for a medical or religious exemption from the vaccine requirement.\n\nThose employees have yet to receive a decision."

        "EXCLUSIVE: Hospital System Faces Staff Shortages Due to COVID-19 Infections, Despite Vaccine Mandate\n\nThe first U.S. hospital system to enforce a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all employees could now be facing a staffing shortage because of a rise in infections.\n\nHouston Methodist now has hundreds of employees out of work because they tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At the same hospital system in 2021, 153 staff members who refused to get vaccinated quit or were fired. Now, Houston Methodist’s leadership is trying to avert a crisis.\n\n“What is worrisome is the climbing number of our employees who cannot work because they are home sick with COVID-19. Almost 400 employees tested positive last week,” Dr. Robert Phillips, Houston Methodist’s executive vice president and chief physician executive, wrote in an internal email on July 12 obtained by The Epoch Times.\n\n“While most of these employees are getting COVID-19 from the community, it is vital that we don’t face a situation where too many employees are out sick and we find ourselves with a staffing shortage.”\n\nHouston Methodist, with a workforce of about 28,000, was the first hospital system in the country to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for all of its employees. It also was the first system in the nation to mandate the vaccine for its private health care providers who are credentialed members of its medical staff. The hospital later required all its employees to get a vaccine booster by March 1.\n\nWhile most employees got vaccinated and stayed, the system is having trouble with staffing as the vaccines prove increasingly worse at protecting against infection as new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, emerge.\n\n“The spike in cases is happening all over the country and is likely attributed to the highly contagious and more vaccine-resistant omicron subvariant,” Phillips wrote. “BA.5 is now the most infectious variant so far and is thought to be four times more vaccine evasive than the last dominant variant.”\n\nBA.5 is a subvariant of Omicron. It recently became the dominant strain in the United States, according to federal data.\n\nPhillips nodded at how the vaccines provide little protection against infection, describing BA.5 as four times more “vaccine-evasive” than the last dominant strain, which was BA2.12.1.\n\nWhile many employees are sick, Phillips said the spike is “not yet correlating with a large surge in hospitalizations” at Houston Methodist, with just 290 COVID-19 patients in the system as of July 12.\n\nNone of the patients are Houston Methodist employees, according to spokeswoman Stefanie Asin. Asked how many of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients are vaccinated, Asin said she didn’t know. Nearly half of the patients in the system in late 2021 were vaccinated.\n\nJennifer Bridges in Houston on June 22, 2021. (Francois Picard/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nProblem With Mandates\n\n“The problem with vaccine mandates is that they are immunologically ignorant by ignoring the powerful effect of natural immunity,” Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and professor, told The Epoch Times. “Natural immunity has been formally studied in over 200 studies and has been found to be more effective than vaccinated immunity.”\n\nStudies from scientists in Qatar, the United States, and other countries have found those who survived COVID-19 had superior protection than the vaccinated, though a smaller number of studies indicate the opposite.\n\nNurse Jennifer Bridges was fired by Houston Methodist in June 2021 for refusing the vaccine.\n\n“This only proves our point that the vaccine doesn’t work. A true vaccine would prevent you from catching the virus. It’s time Methodist owns up to its mistakes,” Bridges told The Epoch Times after reviewing Phillips’s memo.\n\n“That is absolutely a false premise,” Asin responded. “The vaccines were never intended to stop you from getting it. The point of the vaccines is to keep you from severe illness and being hospitalized. The mandates and the vaccines are absolutely working.”\n\nBridges now works at a private COVID-19 clinic located in Houston called BreatheMD, which is owned by Dr. Mary Talley Bowden.\n\n“I had COVID two years ago and have never gotten sick again—even though all I do is care for COVID patients,” she said.\n\nBridges and a number of other former Houston Methodist workers sued their employer over its refusal to recognize natural immunity, as well as other aspects of the mandate, but the lawsuit was thrown out and an appeal was rejected.\n\nBut Makary, who is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, said the science shows the naturally immune should have been retained.\n\n“When Methodist fired nurses who had natural immunity for not being vaccinated, they fired those least likely to spread the infection at the workplace,” he said. “Many nurses have circulating antibodies that neutralize the COVID virus, but they are not antibodies that Methodist hospital recognizes.”\n\nBridges said: “The patients are suffering in the hospitals, and the little staff they have are overworked due to these shortages. It’s sad that they would rather keep away very healthy, unvaccinated nurses with natural immunity when they need us so badly.”\n\n“What does natural immunity actually mean?” Asin responded. “We required the vaccines for our employees to keep the patients safe.” She said they don’t currently have staffing shortages.\n\nFilled vials wait to be distributed ahead of a COVID-19 vaccine clinic in Houston, Texas, on May 13, 2021. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nChange in Tune\n\nThe vaccines were authorized by federal regulators to prevent symptomatic infection, and were touted by vaccine makers and numerous health officials as offering high protection.\n\nAs that protection has waned, authorities have focused on the protection the vaccines provide against severe disease.\n\nWhile Houston Methodist now says the vaccines were intended to protect its employees from severe illness, that isn’t what its leaders said a year and a half ago, according to emails reviewed by The Epoch Times. In February 2021, the hospital system emailed an offer of a $500 bonus to any employee who got two shots of the vaccines. The email says, “The Hope Bonus is a reward for setting the right example and doing our part to stop the spread.”\n\nDr. Marc Boom, president and CEO of Houston Methodist, emailed employees on April 15, 2021, telling them that the mandate was for preventing infection and spread to patients.\n\n“We’re seeing positive results as the number of employee infections has dropped inversely with the number of employees receiving the vaccine. It appears we’ve successfully created herd immunity at Houston Methodist,” he wrote.\n\nHerd immunity means the level of protection that comes from vaccines, prior infection, or both is so high that the spread of a disease is no longer an issue.\n\n“COVID vaccines were originally thought to reduce COVID transmission, but that understanding quickly changed, rendering policies for unvaccinated people obsolete,” Makary said. “If someone who does not have natural immunity chooses not to get vaccinated, they do so at their own individual risk, but they pose no public health threat now that population immunity is high.”\n\nBowden, Bridges’s new employer, lost her privileges with Houston Methodist after she announced that she would only treat unvaccinated patients who couldn’t get care elsewhere. The hospital said Bowden was spreading “misinformation.” She was suspended, and then resigned.\n\nBowden said the number of vaccinated employees who are out sick means Houston Methodist leaders owe an explanation “to those of us who were persecuted for questioning the mandates.”\n\n“We have 400 employees out sick with COVID. They are out sick without severe illness. We stand by the effectiveness of the vaccine,” Asin said.\n\nPhillips told his employees to do their best not to get sick.\n\n“Our patients need us to stay healthy, so I strongly encourage our employees to be as vigilant as possible,” he said. “Please use good judgment in your personal lives as community spread … is high right now.”"

        "How to Survive a Pandemic Michael Greger, M.D., FACLM\n\nA vital, timely text on the pathogens that cause pandemics and how to face them, by the New York Times bestselling author of HOW NOT TO DIE. From tuberculosis and measles to AIDS and COVID-19, these infectious diseases share a common origin story: human interaction with animals. Otherwise known as zoonotic diseases for their passage from animals to humans, these infections—both pre-existing ones and those newly identified—have sparked some of the deadliest plagues in history.\n\nHow did these diseases come about? And what—if anything—can we do to stop them and their fatal march into our communities, our homes, and our bodies? In How to Survive a Pandemic: Overcoming COVID-19 and Preventing the Next Deadly Outbreak, Dr. Michael Greger, physician and an internationally-recognized expert on public health issues, cuts through the prevailing noise and nonsense and reveals not only what we can do to protect ourselves and our loved ones during a pandemic, but also digs deeper into the roots of the problem and tackles the fundamental question: How can we stop the emergence of pandemic viruses in the first place? If there is one concept Dr. Greger draws from his work on preventing and reversing chronic disease, it’s that we must—whenever possible—treat the cause.\n\nLocalized editions of How to Survive a Pandemic are now available in multiple languages.

        "COVID-19 Resources\n\nOn December 30, 2019, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital in the Hubei province of China messaged his fellow physicians, alerting them to the appearance of a concerning cluster of pneumonia cases. Thirty-nine days later, after becoming infected with the very virus he tried to warn his colleagues about, Dr. Li Wenliang was dead at thirty-three. By that time, the disease had already spread to dozens of countries.\n\nBefore the SARS outbreak in 2002, only two coronaviruses were known to cause disease in humans, but neither caused much more than the common cold. The SARS coronavirus, however, went on to kill about one in ten people it infected. A 10 percent mortality rate. A decade later, in 2012, MERS, another deadly coronavirus, emerged. Like SARS, MERS spread to infect thousands of people across dozens of countries, but that time, one in three died. More than a 30 percent mortality rate. Today, we’re fighting to protect ourselves from—and to defeat—the COVID-19 coronavirus.\n\nWhere are these emerging infectious diseases emerging from?\n\nAll human viral infections are believed to originate in animals. Many of the first cases of the SARS coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV, were found in the same kind of place most of the first cases of our current pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV-2, have been found: live animal “wet” markets in China.\n\nTo understand COVID-19 and other deadly viral outbreaks, we have to understand their history and evolution if we’ll ever have a chance at preventing future pandemics. We also have to look back and take lessons from the past. How did we successfully beat back SARS? Why is it more difficult with COVID-19? What do we have to do to slow the pandemic today before we even have a hope at a vaccine?\n\nI cover all of that—from origin stories of past killer pandemics to what we should be doing today to stay safe—and then dive into the clinical side of COVID-19 and discuss what the disease looks like and the best way to treat it. Our videos on COVID-19 are now available to watch here.\n\nUpdate on the vaccines: The approved COVID-19 vaccines appear to be both safe and effective. Dr. Greger has gotten his vaccine!

        "How We Could End the C0VID Pandemic Almost Instantly\n\nBy Steve Kirsch\n\nAny government in the world could do this. It’s easy and obvious. But none of them will do it. Do you want to know why?\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe single most effective knob to turn to get out of the pandemic is to stop silencing those who know how to fix the problem (like Peter McCullough, Paul Marik, George Fareed, Brian Tyson, and more) and start listening to them. Use a competitive process to identify the most effective early treatment protocol and in-patient protocol based on actual patient outcomes. This is actually optional since there are several excellent protocols for both early treatment and in-patient use that have near perfect track records. The competitive process would draw attention to the “search” for the best practices which is important. Deploy it. This is the impossible part. We have plenty of 99% or better treatment protocols, but the medical community isn’t rewarded for saving lives. They are rewarded if they follow the NIH recommended protocols. So that’s what they do. The government isn’t ever going to reward hospitals who save lives. In fact, I know of a doctor who deviated from the NIH protocols, was massively successful in saving lives, and he was fired for not following the protocol. They only reward hospitals who follow orders.\n\nMy common sense plan to end the COVID pandemic\n\nIf nobody dies from COVID anymore and any informed person has access to a treatment protocol that reliably turns COVID into a mild cold, the pandemic mandates, restrictions, and other mitigation policies should all come to an end.\n\nSo suppose Elon Musk (or some other high profile individual or institution like Harvard) offers an X-Prize for:\n\nthe best early treatment protocol ($1M reward) the best in-patient (hospital) treatment protocol ($10M reward)\n\nThe protocol with the best stats in real-life treatment of COVID patients wins.\n\nThey do this with a clinical trial set up at multiple hospitals to evaluate the 5 finalists with the best real-life track records.\n\nThere would be two winners: one for the early treatment protocol, the other for the in-patient protocol.\n\nOf course, we don’t need that step because we can start with known protocols for early treatment such as the Fareed-Tyson protocol or the FLCCC protocol for early treatment and use protocols from the FLCCC or Richard Fleming or others for the in-patient protocol.\n\nThen you find a country, state, or county willing to deploy these best practices in their area somewhere in the world.\n\nSo when someone comes down with COVID, they can get a free “early treatment kit” from their doctor’s office.\n\nAnd if they don’t get the kit and end up in the hospital, they get a treatment protocol that will save at least 95% or more of them. This in-patient protocol would be very different from what we do today since we already know that protocol is a huge failure.\n\nPeople then see it is working in that county, state, or country, and then it gets picked up by other areas.\n\nWhy it won’t work\n\nI used to be a lot more optimistic about people adopting best practices to solve big problems. Now, I’m much more realistic.\n\nThe drug companies clearly don’t want an end to the pandemic and they control everything, so they will ensure that this idea fails.\n\nThis plan won’t work for several reasons:\n\nNobody who has the authority to make a difference will listen to the people who know how to solve the problem. They are only listening to government authorities who don’t have a clue how to solve the problem (but claim that they do). We keep doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. If the vaccines don’t work, the solution is more vaccines (that don’t work). Nobody will offer the prize to find out the best protocols because either 1) they don’t want to waste money finding a solution that they know nobody will dare to deploy or 2) they don’t want to be seen as questioning the narrative or the incompetence of the public health officials. Not even Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will do it. No medical school will sponsor such a contest (even with funding) because they don’t want to lose their government grant money. No hospital in the world will dare to deviate from the gold-standard ineffective CDC in-patient protocol so they won’t even test new options, not even under a clinical trial protocol. So there won’t be an in-patient protocol submitted, even if the prize were $1B. There will only be early treatment protocol entries. This just shows you how “centralized” the control is. Paul Marik would happily supply an in-patient protocol to any hospital willing to to deploy it and split the prize, but no hospital would want to risk it, even as a clinical trial. The clinical trial would never be approved since most IRBs will only allow you to test one thing at a time in these trials EVEN THOUGH every drug is safe and the combinations have been used before with great success. Since all of these drugs and supplements are approved, you don’t need a clinical trial, but hospitals don’t allow doctors to be doctors: they must follow the approved protocol or they will be fired. Even if the two best life-saving protocols were identified, only a few governments in the world will dare to deploy it since it would challenge the incompetency of the CDC and WHO or disrupt payments to government officials from the drug companies. Ron DeSantis wouldn’t even do it in Florida. Individual countries rarely display any independent thought on medical interventions. Almost all simply follow whatever the NIH or WHO says. No critical thinking skills required. It is not about saving lives. It is about saving face and avoiding risk (and getting paid when they toe the line). No leader of any country has enough courage to go against the WHO (maybe there are a few exceptions like Cuba, North Korea and China). And hospitals do what they do because they get monetary incentives from their governments to toe the line.\n\nI’d be absolutely delighted to be proven wrong on all these points.\n\nThe fact this plan won’t work anywhere in the world shows how truly messed up the medical system is today. That’s the real problem.\n\nThe day someone with sufficient authority to make a difference starts taking advice from the doctors who have been silenced is the day we’ll be on a path to end the pandemic.\n\nDon’t hold your breath that will ever happen. We seem to only listen to people whose advice has made things worse and can’t solve the problem."

        "Dr William Bay (The Leader of the Queensland Peoples’ Protest (QPP) And a Registered Practising Qld-Based Doctor): The Reasons Why QPP Is Visiting and Protesting Different Sites Around Queensland\n\nBy Freedom Project Human 1.0 channel\n\nDear Citizens of Queensland,\n\nMy name is Dr William Bay, I am the leader of the Queensland Peoples’ Protest (QPP) and a registered practising QLD-based doctor.\n\nI have been asked by members of our community to outline the reasons why my organisation is visiting and protesting different sites around Queensland.\n\nQPP has now toured 24 different locations across QLD as part of our State Undemocracy Tour to bring awareness to residents that their MPs were complicit in the ending of parliamentary democracy on the 31st March 2022 with the amendment to the Public Health Act 2005 under section 362B (Reference No. 1) that gives the Chief Health Officer unreviewable powers to make any directive he believes is necessary as long as it is connected to preventing the spread of Covid-19. The CHO’s powers are absolute with the Supreme Court and the Premier unable to review them.\n\nThese powers are unconstitutional, illegal and immoral because they override all laws and considerations pertaining to due process, human rights, and basic Western freedoms like freedom to transact, speak and move. Consequently, this law cannot be allowed to stand.\n\nFurthermore, the tyranny in QLD is set to be multiplied with the impending vote on the:\n\nHealth Practitioner Regulation National Law and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 (Reference No. 2) which is before the QLD Parliament now. It is a bill introduced by Health Minister Yvette D’Ath and was reviewed by the Health and Environment Committee headed by Chair, Aaron Harper member for Thuringowa, who disappointingly recommended the bill be passed.\n\nThe committee determined that the key objective of the bill was to strengthen public safety and confidence in the provision of health services.\n\nThe legislation’s key reform is to refocus the objectives and guiding principles of the existing National Law to make public safety and confidence paramount considerations.\n\nIt is worth noting that If the bill is passed in QLD it automatically applies to all state and territories except WA and SA which must (but will very likely) update their laws.\n\nThe threat of this bill is that it seeks to make “public confidence in health services” as the paramount principle of all our healthcare.\n\nThis is a radical departure from the previously well-established and respected principle of patient-centred care.\n\nThe RACGP and AMA have expressed concerns over this refocusing of healthcare, and professional indemnity insurance companies like MIGA and the Insurance Council of Australia have agreed that the term ‘public confidence’ lacks a clear definition and scope, and they raised concerns about how courts and tribunals would interpret the term.\n\nThe Queensland Peoples’ Protest argues strongly that the passing of this legislation will end the practice of medicine as we know it and will result in the death of informed consent, medical ethics, and the very lives of many Queenslanders and Australians.\n\nThis is because when treatment of patients is not guided by their individual circumstances (medical history, medications, allergies etc.) but by the principle of what makes the Department of Health in each state look most trustworthy; then mistakes and indeed, incorrect treatments of patients is bound to occur.\n\nMistakes in medical treatment will inevitably lead to patient deaths, deaths that can and will be directly attributable to the passage of this inherently unconscionable bill.\n\nThe Queensland Peoples’ Protest urges all Queenslanders to write to their state MP and demand the blockage of this bill lest all our medical freedoms are eroded and unimaginable patient harm occurs to you or your loved ones."

        "Home » Australia, Health, Justice, Survival » New Zealand doctors call for criminal homicide investigations into covid-19 vaccine deaths\n\nThe group New Zealand Doctors Speaking out With Science (NZDSOS) has published an open letter calling for a comprehensive investigation into the wave of deaths occurring in New Zealand among the “fully vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\nA redacted version is available for the public to read, while an unredacted version is still being carefully prepared for law enforcement to ensure it contains all of the necessary information for a proper investigation to be conducted.\n\nAccording to the group, there is a “shockingly large burden of deaths and injuries following the Covid-19 vaccine, of itself and compared to any other treatment or vaccine in modern times.”\n\n“We report many cases that DEMAND proper investigation, as befits any medication lacking safety studies,” the letter’s executive summary further states.\n\nNZDSOS says the country’s surveillance systems, which would otherwise catch these injuries and deaths, have been disabled “in order to hide the extent of harm.”\n\n“Adverse event reporting is NOT COMPULSORY, and this alone undermines any attempt to portray the injections as safe,” the group further explains.\n\n“CARM (New Zealand’s version of the U.S.-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) was never designed to early warn about experimental drugs rolled out to massive numbers.”\n\nPost-covid injection deaths are the elephant in the room that nobody wants to address\n\nPerhaps most concerning are the large numbers of young children who after getting shot are suffering cardiac injuries that used to only occur among the elderly – though many elderly people have mysteriously died post-jab as well.\n\nSeeing as how children have a zero percent risk of dying from covid, let alone getting sick from it in the first place, jabbing them is arguably the worst crime against humanity that has occurred in modern times.\n\n“We believe we are being lied to,” says NZDSOS. “We appeal AGAIN to the Police, headed by Andrew Coster, and our MPs (members of parliament), to intervene to protect the People.\n\nHalfway through the letter, a long list of cases is presented showing that post-injection injuries and deaths are anything but “rare.” They are disturbingly and obviously common when looking at the data, though few are brave enough to actually look.\n\nA summary of some 500 post-injection deaths is included in the letter, as recorded in the Citizen’s Database. A community group of volunteers with backgrounds in healthcare, information technology and science help to maintain it with the support of epidemiology and database professionals.\n\n“It has been built mainly from notifications by relatives, friends and health workers of people who have died following the covid-19 shots,” the letter explains.\n\n“Scientific accuracy forbids the use of the word ‘vaccine,’ since it does not prevent the disease nor its transmission. Some information has been gleaned from social media posts, newspaper reports and obituaries. Has anyone noticed how many there are? ‘Taken too soon,’ ‘sudden and unexpected’ adorn the pages.”\n\nBecause the so-called “authorities” refuse to even look into the situation at all is a huge red flag all on its own. If the jabs really are “safe and effective” as claimed, then there should be no problem looking through each case in order to debunk it as unrelated to the injections, right?\n\nThis is the elephant in the room that almost nobody in any position of power is willing to address, and NZDSOS is demanding once again that someone step up to the plate and take the matter seriously on behalf of public health.\n\n“Whatever the actual truth, NZDSOS and many others are certain that the true number of dead and injured people is very elevated, and not made clear to the public, who thus continue to sleepwalk into a treatment that is much more dangerous than the disease it purports to prevent, especially for the young,” the group says.\n\nSource\n\nPlease wait...\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nDid you like this information?

The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) will abide by the decision, but will appeal, it has 3 days to do it.\n\nThe magistrate ordered “the immediate suspension of vaccinations against Sarscov 2 (COVID-19) to children (under 13 years of age). Under conviction of contempt,” says the ruling.\n\nThe suspension will continue until certain “conditions” are met. One of them is that ” all purchase contracts for these vaccines be published or published in their entirety and without proof.

        "This time the health news is real. Joe Biden has COVID.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that the president has tested positive for COVID-19, and is experiencing “mild symptoms.”\n\nBiden has been put on Paxlovid, an antiviral drug that lessens the severity of the illness. Of course, Biden has been double vaxed and boosted.\n\nPress Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says Biden “will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time. He has been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone this morning, and will participate in his planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from the residence.”\n\nPlease Support The Stream : Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day.\n\nBiden’s handlers have taken great pains to shield the 79-year-old high-risk senior citizen from COVID. For example, before his trip to the Middle East, Israeli officials were told the president would not be shaking any hands. (He ended up doing so anyway.) And of course, he spent the 2020 campaign in his basement, with his scarce public appearances requiring great efforts at social distancing. Remember the circles?\n\nOne Day After Biden Cancer Gaffe\n\nThe news of the COVID diagnosis comes one day after Biden ignited a frenzy by saying he has cancer. Specifically, “That’s why I and so d*** many other people I grew up with have cancer … ” The White House quickly corrected the record, stating Biden was referring to his past bout with skin cancer.\n\nWe join the rest of the nation in praying for Biden’s quick recovery from the virus, and that there are no lingering effects.\n\nAl Perrotta is the Managing Editor of The Stream, chief barista for The Brew and co-author, with John Zmirak, of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Immigration.

        "New York’s covid quarantine and isolation orders ruled unconstitutional\n\nAn effort by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, to grant herself unlimited power and authority to invoke isolation and quarantine measures whenever she feels like it has been struck down by a state Supreme Court judge.\n\nJustice Ronald Ploetz decided that Hochul’s plan is unlawful and unconstitutional, ruling that involuntary detention like the kinds Hochul craves “is a severe deprivation of individual liberty.”\n\nHochul’s provision, dubbed Rule 2.13, comes with no scientific data or expert testimony on why it is necessary, Ploetz said. Instead, all it does is “provide a quick and nimble approach” for Hochul to deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights on a whim. (Related: New York also waged economic warfare against the unvaccinated.)\n\n“Involuntary quarantine may have far-reaching consequences such as loss of income (or employment) and isolation from family,” Ploetz said, calling Rule 2.13 even “more egregious” than mask mandates, which are also tyrannical and unsubstantiated by science.\n\nRule 2.13, entitled “Isolation and Quarantine Procedures,” reads as follows:\n\n“Whenever appropriate to control the spread of a highly contagious communicable disease, the State Commissioner of Health may issue and / or may direct the local health authority to issue isolation and / or quarantine orders, consistent with due process of law, to all such persons as the State Commissioner of Health shall determine appropriate.”\n\nThe rule also would have granted health authorities the jurisdiction to “monitor” New Yorkers to ensure that they remain in constant compliance with Hochul’s demands. Hochul would then have been able to decide arbitrarily whether or not an individual “requires a higher level of medical care,” meaning more tyranny.\n\nIllness is not an excuse for the government to trample the Constitution\n\nAfter Hochul filed her proposed rule, state Sen. George Borrello along with two Republican state Assembly members and NYS United filed a lawsuit against both Hochul and state health commissioner Mary Bassett.\n\n“They argued that the rule lacked due process, and gave authorities too much discretion when deciding who should be placed in quarantine,” reported The Post Millennial.\n\nIt turns out that Section 2120 of the state’s Public Health Law requires that an “independent magistrate” decide on the terms of detention, not some rogue governor like Hochul.\n\nContrary to how it might sound, the state Supreme Court of New York is actually not the “highest court in the land.” Strangely, New York law places the Supreme Court of that state at the bottom of the judicial system. The Court of Appeals holds the top spot.\n\nConcerning New York’s jab mandates, a commenter at Natural News pointed to the case of Friend v. City of Gainesville, which was a success in Florida thanks to the 1905 Supreme Court case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts.\n\nIt takes time and work, but lawsuits such as these, as well as the latest one in New York, are necessary to stem the tide of tyranny that is spreading over the land under the guise of fighting a “pandemic.”\n\nThe government does not have any right to violate the Constitution simply because there is a sickness supposedly going around.\n\n“To free yourself from evil you must find the moral courage to remove the perpetrators of evil,” another commenter wrote, touching on this from a slightly different perspective.\n\n“Then and only then is a quaint and peaceful life lived in pursuit of the things that drive each and every one of us in our numerous endeavors throughout a harmonious life possible.”\n\nSomeone else added that Americans really need to step it up so that these “fake people in our government who are killing Americans” are not successful in their tyrannical agenda.\n\nThe latest news about the Chinese Virus can be found at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nThePostMillennial.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "How Pfizer profited from the pandemic\n\nSTORY AT-A-GLANCE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a real boon to Pfizer. Not only has it doubled Pfizer’s annual revenue, it has also given the drugmaker unique weight in determining U.S. health policy — something that concerns even staunch vaccine-pushers like Dr. Paul Offit\n\nPfizer’s revenue in 2021 was $81.3 billion — approximately double that of 2020 — and the COVID shot accounted for $36.78 billion of that\n\nPfizer’s COVID jab dominates 70% of the U.S. and European markets, and Paxlovid, its COVID drug, has become a standard treatment choice in hospitals. This despite findings showing the shot doesn’t prevent infection or transmission, and that Paxlovid causes severe rebound and supercharges mutations\n\nThe U.S. had thrown away 82.2 million expired COVID jab doses as of mid-May 2022, yet the Biden administration ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022 for a fall booster campaign that will cost taxpayers $3.2 billion\n\nPfizer’s contracts are almost exclusively slanted in Pfizer’s favor. They’re guaranteed payment while having no financial liability for injuries and deaths, and it appears this indemnification applies even if they were to be found guilty of fraud\n\n(Article by Dr. Joseph Mercola republished from Articles.Mercola.com)\n\nAccording to Kaiser Health News (KHN),1 the COVID-19 pandemic has been a real boon to Pfizer. Not only has it yielded “outsize benefits” in terms of profits, but it has also “given the drugmaker unusual weight in determining U.S. health policy.”\n\n“Based on internal research, the company’s executives have frequently announced the next stage in the fight against the pandemic before government officials have had time to study the issue, annoying many experts in the medical field and leaving some patients unsure whom to trust,” KHN reporter Arthur Allen writes, adding:2\n\n“When last year Bourla suggested that a booster shot would soon be needed, U.S. public health officials later followed, giving the impression that Pfizer was calling the tune.\n\nSome public health experts and scientists worry these decisions were hasty, noting, for example, that although boosters with the mRNA shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech improve antibody protection initially, it generally doesn’t last.\n\nSince January, Bourla has been saying that U.S. adults will probably all need annual booster shots, and senior FDA officials have indicated since April that they agree … The company’s power worries some vaccinologists, who see its growing influence in a realm of medical decision-making traditionally led by independent experts …\n\nWhen President Biden in September 2021 offered boosters to Americans — not long after [Pfizer CEO Albert] Bourla had recommended them — Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia … wondered, ‘Where’s the evidence you are at risk of serious disease when confronted with COVID if you are vaccinated and under 50?’ Policies on booster recommendations for different groups are complex and shifting, Offit said, but the CDC, rather than Bourla and Pfizer, should be making them. ‘We’re being pushed along,’ he said. ‘The pharmaceutical companies are acting like public health agencies.’”\n\nThe fact that a vaccine-pusher like Offit — infamous for claiming a baby can safely tolerate 10,000 vaccines at once3 — is questioning and pushing back against Pfizer’s influence over health policy reveals just how brazen, unethical and potentially dangerous that is.\n\nMassive Profits Made From Useless Products\n\nAccording to Allen, Pfizer’s revenue in 2021 was $81.3 billion4 — approximately double that of 2020 — and the COVID shot accounted for $36.78 billion5 of that. For comparison, Lipitor, Pfizer’s previous top selling statin, generates roughly $2 billion a year,6 while their strep vaccine, Prevnar 13 rakes in $6 billion a year.7\n\nIts mRNA gene transfer injection against COVID now dominates 70% of the U.S. and European markets, and Paxlovid, Pfizer’s COVID drug, has become a standard treatment choice in hospitals. This, despite researchers finding Paxlovid (molnupiravir) causes severe rebound and supercharges mutations.\n\nIn a rational scenario, that finding would have put a stop to its use, but no. In an official health advisory8 to the public, issued May 24, 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first warns that Paxlovid is associated with “recurrence of COVID-19 or ‘COVID-19 rebound,’” and then in the very next sentence stresses in bold print a narrative supporting its use and enriching Pfizer with instructions saying:\n\n“Paxlovid continues to be recommended for early- stage treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 among persons at high risk for progression to severe disease.”\n\nAllen also notes that, during an investor call, a Pfizer official highlighted reports of Paxlovid’s failure, but spun it into “good news” for investors, as patients may require multiple courses!9 Obviously the objective has long ago shifted from helping humans to raping them for as much profit as possible.\n\nSimilarly, while Pfizer’s COVID jab clearly doesn’t prevent infection or spread, and Americans are rejecting the shots in growing numbers — 82.2 million doses had expired and were chucked in the trash as of mid-May 202210 — the U.S. government still went ahead and ordered another 105 million doses at the end of June 2022.\n\nThese are intended for a fall booster campaign, at a cost to taxpayers of $3.2 billion.11 The U.S. is actually paying about 50% more for each of these new jab boosters this time around — $30.47 per dose compared to $19.50 per dose paid for the first 100 million doses.\n\nThe U.S. government has also promised to purchase another 20 million courses of Paxlovid, at an eye-watering cost of $530 per five-day course. Basically, Pfizer is being financially rewarded for producing products that are useless at best and dangerous at worst, and we’re all paying for it. In case you’re curious, that is another $10.6 billion transferred from U.S. taxpayers to Pfizer.\n\nFuture Boosters Won’t Undergo Human Clinical Trials\n\nAfter you likely thought it couldn’t ever get any worse, KHN also touches on, but doesn’t delve into, the fact that Pfizer suggested they skip human trials as they move forward with jabs that are reformulated for newer variants. If this strikes you as crazy, you’d be right. It’s sheer madness, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — a clearly captured agency — has already surreptitiously agreed to this egregious miscarriage of science.\n\nHow this wicked scheme, known as the “Future Framework,”12 was adopted by the FDA without formal vote is explained by Toby Rogers, Ph.D. — a political economist whose research focus is on regulatory capture and Big Pharma corruption13 — in the video above. He also explained it in a June 29, 2022, Substack article:14\n\n“Yesterday [June 28], the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee approved a bivalent COVID-19 shot with the Wuhan strain and the Omicron variant … Wait, hold up, I thought the FDA was voting on the Future Framework yesterday?\n\nThe policy question was whether reformulated COVID-19 shots would be treated as new molecular entities (which they are) in which case they should be subject to formal review or whether reformulated shots would be treated as ‘biologically similar’ to existing Covid-19 shots and be allowed to skip clinical trials altogether.\n\nApparently the FDA did not have the votes to just pass this as a policy question. If you ask anyone whether reformulated mRNA represents a new molecular entity, well of course it is, so that would require formal regulatory review.\n\nWhat the FDA did instead was to smuggle the policy question in disguised as a vote about reformulated ‘boosters’ for the fall.\n\nIn essence, the FDA just started doing the Future Framework (picking variants willy nilly, skipping clinical trials) and essentially dared the committee members to turn down a booster dose — knowing that all of the VRBPAC members are hand-picked because they’ve never met a vaccine they did not like.\n\nSo of course only two people on the committee had the courage to turn down a booster dose — even though it was based on this preposterous process (that was never formally adopted) where there was literally no data at all … By stealth, the FDA replaced a system based on evidence with a system based entirely on belief.”\n\nCountries Held to Ransom\n\nIn 2021, secret details of Pfizer’s contracts came to light, showing they are essentially holding countries hostage to nonnegotiable demands for payment in full AND freedom from liability.15\n\nIn late February 2021, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported16 that Pfizer was demanding countries put up sovereign assets as collateral for expected vaccine injury lawsuits resulting from its COVID-19 jab.\n\nSeveral countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Peru, agreed to this demand, putting up bank reserves, military bases and embassy buildings as collateral. In short, theses governments are guaranteeing Pfizer will be compensated for any expenses resulting from injury lawsuits against it, so the company won’t lose a dime if its COVID shot injures people.\n\nShockingly, these terms are binding even if those injuries are the result of negligent company practices, fraud or malice!\n\nGovernment purchasers must acknowledge that the effectiveness and safety of the shots are completely unknown, all while indemnifying Pfizer against any and all financial liability.\n\nIn October that same year, Public Citizen published the secret contracts17,18 between Pfizer and Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Dominican Republic, the European Commission, Peru, the U.S. and the U.K., further revealing the extent to which these countries handed power over to Pfizer. In almost all scenarios, Pfizer’s interests come first.\n\nFor example, government purchasers must acknowledge that the effectiveness and safety of the shots are completely unknown, all while indemnifying Pfizer against any and all financial liability. This is the ultimate corporate maleficence, using their leverage to force the kill shot down these countries’ throats and avoiding any personal responsibility for damages.\n\nEven if Pfizer eventually is convicted of fraud in the U.S. and loses all its liability protection from the COVID jabs because of it, that judgment would not impact these foreign contracts. These countries sold their souls to Pfizer and have absolutely no recourse but to pay even if the shots kill everyone.\n\nThe contracts for at least four countries also secure Pfizer’s intellectual property rights even if the company is found to have stolen intellectual property rights of others. In such case, the government purchaser becomes the liable party. As explained by Public Citizen:19\n\n“For example, if another vaccine maker sued Pfizer for patent infringement in Colombia, the contract requires the Colombian government to foot the bill. Pfizer also explicitly says that it does not guarantee that its product does not violate third-party IP, or that it needs additional licenses.\n\nPfizer takes no responsibility in these contracts for its potential infringement of intellectual property. In a sense, Pfizer has secured an IP waiver for itself. But internationally, Pfizer is fighting similar efforts to waive IP barriers for all manufacturers.”\n\nEqually shocking is that countries are forced to follow through on their vaccine orders even if other drugs or treatments emerge that can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19.20 Is it any wonder, then, that governments around the world have suppressed the use of safe and effective outpatient drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin?\n\nIf these drugs were allowed to be used and could be proven to work, the COVID injections would be completely unnecessary and their emergency use authorization would disappear, yet governments are on the hook for hundreds of millions of doses.\n\nPfizer Has ‘Habitual Offender’ Track Record\n\nThe fact that Pfizer has behaved like a criminal who works out a cover story for a planned murder before committing it is not surprising, considering its history. Pfizer, has been sued in multiple venues over unethical behavior, including unethical drug testing and illegal marketing practices.21\n\nIn his 2010 paper,22 “Tough on Crime? Pfizer and the CIHR,” Robert G. Evans, Ph.D., Emeritus Professor at Vancouver School of Economics, described Pfizer as “a ‘habitual offender,’ persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results.”\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010 alone, Pfizer and its subsidiaries were fined $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards. They are recurrent criminal felons. None of these convictions has deterred their nefarious behavior.\n\nIn 2011, Pfizer agreed to pay another $14.5 million to settle federal charges of illegal marketing,23 and in 2014 they settled federal charges relating to improper marketing of the kidney transplant drug Rapamune to the tune of $35 million,24 as well as $75 million to settle charges relating to its testing of a new broad spectrum antibiotic on critically ill Nigerian children.\n\nAs reported by the Independent25 at the time, Pfizer sent a team of doctors into Nigeria in the midst of a meningitis epidemic. For two weeks, the team set up right next to a medical station run by Doctors Without Borders and began dispensing the experimental drug, Trovan. Of the 200 children picked, half got the experimental drug and the other half the already licensed antibiotic Rocephin.\n\nEleven of the children treated by the Pfizer team died, and many others suffered side effects such as brain damage and organ failure. Pfizer denied wrongdoing. According to the company, only five of the children given Trovan died, compared to six who received Rocephin, so their drug was not to blame.\n\nThe problem was they never told the parents that their children were being given an experimental drug. What’s more, while Pfizer produced a permission letter from a Nigerian ethics committee, the letter turned out to have been backdated. The ethics committee itself wasn’t set up until a year after the trial had already taken place. Pfizer’s rap sheet also includes bribery, environmental violations, labor and worker safety violations and more.26\n\nWolves in Sheep’s Clothing\n\nNow, despite Pfizer being one of the least ethical drug companies, we’re told to trust them with our very lives, and the lives of our precious children. They’re going to put out booster shots this fall that have undergone absolutely no testing whatsoever, and we’re to simply throw caution to the wind because Pfizer — which has no liability whatsoever — says so.\n\nIn 2014, Pfizer faced a surge of lawsuits that accused it of hiding known side effects of its anticholesterol drug Lipitor.27 They got off scot-free that time, as a federal judge dismissed thousands of cases alleging the drug caused Type 2 diabetes.28,29 But at least they had liability and could be sued.\n\nWhen it comes to the COVID jabs, injured patients and family members of those killed by it won’t even have the ability to sue for damages, as governments around the world have indemnified them completely, and it looks as though they might not even be liable even if they’re found guilty of fraud. But we will have to see what the courts rule on that one. Still, that any nation would agree to a contract like that is just mindboggling.\n\nMeanwhile, mounting evidence shows the COVID shots destroy immune function over time, and Pfizer’s own trial data reveal deaths and serious adverse events numbering in the tens of thousands.\n\nIt’s hard to tell who’s more deserving of punishment — Pfizer or the equally captured federal agencies, the FDA and the CDC, that go along with them and do nothing to protect the lives of the youngest members of our society. Clearly, it’s up to us to protect ourselves and our loved ones, because wolves in sheep’s clothing are ruling the roost — they’re making all the decisions, and captured agencies are simply doing their bidding.\n\nRead more at: Articles.Mercola.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Calgary firefighters file $38 million lawsuit against city and fire department over covid “vaccine” mandates\n\nNineteen firefighters in Calgary who were fired for refusing Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccination” are now suing the department and the city for $38 million in damages.\n\nPlaintiffs say the Canadian city’s injection mandate “violated” their basic “human rights” by forcing them to alter their DNA in order to continue working and making a living.\n\n“There’s something tyrannical about these mandates,” says Stephen Dabbagh, the lawsuit’s leader. (Related: Canada’s covid jab mandate is why the trucker caravans were formed.)\n\n“We can’t identity everybody behind it, but what we can do is hold people accountable, like the fire chief, politicians, city managers. Those people are responsible for their actions.”\n\nDabbagh had worked as a firefighter at the Calgary Fire Department (CFD) for some 20 years, including most recently as a fire captain. He reportedly resigned under duress on Dec. 8, 2021 after being told that he had to take the jab.\n\nUnwilling to let that stand without a fight, Dabbagh and 18 of his colleagues banded together to try to stop the “political and ideological tyranny of these mandates.”\n\n“It’s about trying to hold people (politicians, bureaucrats) accountable for their actions,” Dabbagh told LifeSiteNews.\n\nThe suit’s Statement of Claim was delivered to the City of Calgary and CFD on July 7 in the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta.\n\nMore lawsuits like this need to be filed\n\nA portion of the suit, $2 million, aims to cover damages for mental duress and violations of the firefighters’ Charter rights under the Criminal Code for “Punitive and exemplary damages.”\n\n“By forcing its loyal employees to take experimental injections as a requisite to employment, the City has breached its legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm to its Employees contrary to section 217.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada,” the lawsuit reads.\n\n“The Plaintiffs have suffered measurable damages, including mental distress, anxiety, and, in particular, injury to dignity and self-respect. The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to significant damages due to the manner in which the City suspended their employment, including a claim for punitive aggravated damages arising from flagrant human rights and Charter violations.”\n\nAll city employees in Calgary, including firefighters, were told back in the fall of 2021 that they had to get jabbed for the Fauci Flu and show proof of it or else submit to constant “testing,” which involves an invasive cotton swab being shoved up the nose.\n\nThere were also limited exemptions available, though not many qualified for those.\n\nIn March of 2022, Calgary’s covid jab mandate was “suspended,” but it was already too late for Dabbagh and his colleagues. Their goal now is to get paid for what they had to endure, as well as to stop this type of tyranny from ever being imposed again.\n\n“The law says we have these rights (to refuse the jabs via Canada’s Charter) even if they are not being upheld by the courts,” Dabbagh says.\n\n“For me, it is using every avenue to fight against the political and ideology tyranny of these mandates … These medications, or whatever they are called, are not safe and did not work.”\n\nNearly all of the firefighters named in the suit have worked as city firefighters for a long time. One of them was fired simply for showing support for the Freedom Convoy, which is a violation of rights all on its own.\n\nSome of the firefighters have returned to work but under duress. They are still named in the lawsuit because their human rights have been impacted, and “even people who were on leave at the time have still suffered human rights violations,” says Alberta lawyer Leighton Gray, who is representing the firefighters in the case.\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at Immunization.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "Thousands of non-COVID excess deaths in the UK likely caused by COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe latest data from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) has raised a lot of questions due to the sudden appearance of over 8,750 excess deaths from causes other than the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), with many questioning whether the vaccines caused these deaths.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the government received reports of 10,357 registered deaths in the week ending on July 1. This represents 1,128 – or 12.2 percent – more deaths above the five-year average. Of these deaths, only 332 were registered with COVID-19 as a contributory cause and 212 were registered with COVID-19 as the underlying cause. The remaining 916 excess deaths were not officially attributed to COVID-19.\n\nThis brings the total non-COVID-19 excess deaths in England and Wales in the 10 weeks since the recent coronavirus spike in late April to 8,756 deaths. (Related: European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system.)\n\nExperts who have noticed this spike in excess deaths have called for an urgent investigation to figure out what is causing this alarming trend.\n\nThe experts have also noted that there is a strong correlation between the rise in deaths and the beginning of the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine doses during the government’s spring booster campaign among people over the age of 75 in England. They believe this connection needs to be investigated.\n\nBut the British government has yet to signal an intent to conduct investigation or even offer any kind of explanation regarding the high rate of excess deaths. The total number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths in the U.K. is decreasing, meaning that the current wave – likely due to the vaccines – is easing.\n\nONS data shows over 200,000 deaths allegedly due to COVID-19\n\nThe latest data from the ONS shows that more than 200,000 people in the U.K. have allegedly died due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began in early 2020. This monumental mark was reached on June 25, but was only confirmed recently due to the time it takes for deaths to be registered with the statistics office.\n\nThe British government is admitting these deaths while at the same time boasting about the fact that the U.K. has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 75 percent of the population fully vaccinated and 60 percent boosted.\n\nThe registered deaths – totaling 200,247 deaths – were only counted if COVID-19 was mentioned on their death certificates, either as a main cause of death or a contributory factor. This strongly suggests that the British government may be hiding more deaths either due to COVID-19 or due to the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a lobbying group, called the breaching of the 200,000 mark “a tragedy” and “damning” evidence of the British government’s failure to properly handle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDr. Michael Head, senior research fellow for global health at the University of Southampton, said that the “vast majority” of the more than 200,000 deaths were preventable, but they occurred due to policy failures at the national level.\n\n“It’s important to remember that, for every death, there will be many more hospitalizations, long COVID and other indirect burdens such as greater impact on other areas of the U.K. health service and socioeconomic consequences such as bereavements and inability to work,” said Head. “Recorded COVID-19 deaths are the tip of a very unpleasant and far-reaching iceberg.”\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this video of David Icke explaining how the so-called “emerging diseases” are a way to cover up COVID-19 vaccine injuries and deaths.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nCanadian study confirms mRNA vaccines increase risk of myocarditis, especially in young men after second dose.\n\nQatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.\n\nHong Kong medical experts find evidence suggesting COVID-19 vaccines cause heart disease.\n\nThe late Dr. Zev Zelenko: COVID-19 vaccines were meant to keep people in state of mass psychosis.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: COVID-19 should be fought with early intervention, not vaccines.\n\nSources include:\n\nLifeSiteNews.com\n\nONS.gov.uk\n\nIndependent.co.uk\n\nNYTimes.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "FDA grants full approval to untested Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to Pfizer’s Comirnaty Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 years old.\n\nIn a press release, the FDA said the approval followed a “rigorous analysis and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data,” and that the vaccine “has been, and will continue to be, authorized for emergency use in this age group since May 2021.”\n\nHowever, the vaccine is not yet available in the U.S. for any age group as it is not the same formula as the Pfizer vaccine that has been authorized for use under the EUA and distributed as “fully approved.”\n\nMary Holland, the president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said the approval of Comirnaty for adolescents as young as 12 is “head-spinning.” (Related: Pfizer, FDA knew their COVID vaccine causes immunosuppression, ADE, VAED.)\n\n“The FDA failed to convene an expert committee and failed to appropriately weigh the risk-benefit profile of this vaccine for this age group,” Holland noted. “Even vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit acknowledged FDA decisions are being made based on political pressure, not science. When commenting on the agency’s vote last week to allow reformulated booster shots, he said it felt like ‘the fix was in.'”\n\nSome states will also likely attempt to put the vaccine on the childhood vaccine schedule despite unknown risks.\n\nComirnaty to receive liability protection when added to CDC’s immunization schedule\n\nWhile the Comirnaty vaccine can be mandated, it has no liability shield, which means that vials of the branded product that say Comirnaty on the label are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products. Only vaccines distributed under EUA have liability protection under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act (PREP).\n\nBut Comirnaty can receive liability protection when it is fully approved for children and added to the CDC’s immunization schedule, bringing it under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n\nHolland said Pfizer’s fraud and collusion with the government are becoming more evident: CHD is already challenging the EUA for children ages six months to 11, and will also be at the forefront of challenging this same authorization for adolescents and teens.\n\nFor its part, Pfizer said the approval is based on data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of 2,260 participants ages 12 through 15, and about half of the participants elicited neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) that demonstrate “strong immunogenicity in a subset of adolescents one month after the second dose.”\n\nIt is yet unknown what happens to antibody levels after one month, but peer-reviewed research suggests that protection after second and third doses of the vaccine wanes rapidly against the omicron variant.\n\nPfizer used an old analysis of 16 to 25-year-olds conducted before the delta and omicron surges, with an efficacy analysis conducted between November 2020 and May 2021.\n\nThe company admitted in its own press release that “only SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern identified from the confirmed COVID-19 cases in this age group was alpha.”\n\nMeanwhile, FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) said in its June 28 meeting that vaccine experts raised concerns that neutralizing antibodies did not correlate to clinical protection, noting that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine had a twofold increase in neutralizing antibody levels compared to that of Pfizer’s during the trials, but it still did not translate into a clinically significant difference in terms of protection against severe diseases.\n\nWatch the video below exposing how the vaccine advisory committee lied to get FDA approval for babies.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nPfizer tells federal judge that Pfizer owns the federal government and is thereby immune to normal contract law.\n\nNew York back in high risk category as “worst” omicron subvariant ravages the state.\n\nNearly 8,000 non-COVID excess deaths in UK traced to COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots.\n\nFather’s 20-year battle on behalf of vaccine-injured son exposes travesty of liability-free vaccines.\n\nFDA uses fraudulent data to justify pushing covid shots on infants and toddlers.\n\nSources include:\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org\n\nJAMANetwork.com\n\nBrighteon.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "I stand with the farmers of the world protesting the Great Reset’s food agenda\n\n(LifeSiteNews) — A LifeSiteNews petition expressing support for the European farmers taking a stand against harmful environmental regulations has quickly garnered almost 18,000 signatures.\n\n(Article by Doug Mainwaring republished from LifeSiteNews.com)\n\nThe signatures testify that more and more people have realized that the health and wellbeing of their families hinge on the success of the farmers’ gallant defiance of the European elites’ Great Reset agenda.\n\nThe farmers know that not only are green policies harmful to their livelihoods, such policies will hasten a global food shortage. This is not just a battle within the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and elsewhere in the EU to save farmers: this is a battle over the future availability of food around the world.\n\nThe threat is by no means hypothetical. Less than two years after organic farming was mandated in Sri Lanka, outlawing the use of synthetic fertilizers, the entire nation now faces a massive food shortage and catastrophic economic collapse.??\n\nThese types of regulations most certainly can —and inevitably will— make their way to every corner of the globe. The brave European farmers now serve as the world’s first line of defense.??\n\nThe standoff began after Dutch lawmakers approved legislative proposals to significantly decrease greenhouse emissions by the end of the decade, most notably by cracking down on ammonia and nitrogen oxide, which are common in farming.\n\nThis plan seeks to exceed the globalist EU’s agreement among member states to reduce greenhouse emissions as a means to combat climate change by at least 40% by the year 2030.?\n\nAs a result, it would seem almost inevitable that thousands of farms could find themselves in jeopardy within the coming years, but Dutch farmers have no plans to stand down. In fact, this embrace of EU and World Economic Forum (WEF)-style environmental demands is the primary force behind the ongoing protests by as many as 40,000 farmers, who, in response, have taken their tractors to highways from the Netherlands to Italy, making an unmistakable statement of resistance reminiscent of that of the Canadian Freedom Convoy truckers in order to protect their livelihoods.\n\nSuch policies are a clear tenet of the Great Reset, pushed by globalist entities around the world like the WEF.?\n\nLet there be no doubt: these extreme environmental policies and transgressions against working people cannot be expected to stop any time soon.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to make your voice heard in support of the hardworking men and women who wish to maintain the freedom to provide for their families without excessive government and globalist interference.\n\nRead more at: LifeSiteNews.com\n\nstyle=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8193958963374960\" data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\"> data-ad-slot=\"1479220332\">\n\nSubmit a correction >>"

        "A week after President Biden claimed people vaccinated against COVID-19 couldn't get infected, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky contradicted him and warned Americans that vaccination wasn't even reducing viral loads in infected people, making them vectors of transmission.\n\nTo justify his sweeping vaccine mandates for large employers and healthcare workers, the commander-in-chief continued claiming for several months that vaccination stops transmission, getting fact-checked along the way and challenged by data from around the world.\n\nWith the fully vaccinated and boosted Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) both contracting COVID in the past week, federal narratives on vaccine effectiveness are in sharp retreat, while the country is progressively souring on each new authorization.\n\nYale University epidemiologist Harvey Risch theorized on the John Solomon Reports podcast that the antibodies generated by COVID vaccines, based on a long-outdated viral strain, \"don't bind so well\" to newer variants such as Omicron.\n\n\"Those old antibodies are covering up the surface of the virus, keeping the virus from getting attacked by the new antibodies that the immune system is making\" in response to newer variants, he said.\n\nLess than 3% of children ages 6 months through 4 years old have received a first vaccine dose in their first month of authorization, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's analysis of CDC figures. Two weeks in, when the numbers peaked, only 1.4% had received a first dose.\n\nThis stands in contrast to figures for 5-11 year-olds, 9.3% of whom had received a first dose two weeks after authorization, KFF said. Full-series vaccination has stalled at two-thirds of the population ages 5 and up, and a single booster at 34%, according to CDC data.\n\nBiden's breakthrough infection prompted his predecessor's coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx, to admit she \"knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection,\" telling Fox News host Neil Cavuto Friday that \"we overplayed the vaccines.\" White House Chief Medical Adviser Anthony Fauci, who served with Birx, recently made a similar admission.\n\nExpressing such \"misinformation\" on social media was grounds for removal until recently.\n\nTwitter permanently banned former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson a year ago for saying COVID vaccines don't stop infection or transmission, only reinstating him this month to resolve litigation after an unfavorable court ruling.\n\nThe social media company similarly flipped upon receiving a legal warning letter from epidemiologist Andrew Bostom, banned from the platform for sharing peer-reviewed research on vaccine side effects.\n\nBirx nonetheless urged Americans to get vaccinated and boosted to protect against \"severe disease and hospitalization,\" even while telling Cavuto that half of COVID deaths during the Omicron wave were in \"older, vaccinated\" people.\n\nShe claimed that taking Pfizer anti-COVID pill Paxlovid is \"going to save your lives\" regardless of vaccination or boosters, without mentioning its association with COVID reinfections. Fauci himself had such a \"rebound\" after taking a course of the antiviral for a breakthrough infection in June, which he followed with a second course in defiance of FDA recommendations.\n\nTweet URL\n\nYale's Risch is doubtful about the evidentiary basis for the claims about reduced severe outcomes as well.\n\nFauci offered no evidence \"that he would have been worse if he had not been vaccinated,\" the epidemiologist said, crediting \"confirmation bias\" rather than science for Fauci's conclusion. The boosters have not been available long enough to confidently declare they work well against recent Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, Risch added.\n\nThe failure of Biden's second booster to protect him from infection less than four months after receiving it is provoking wider skepticism of ongoing federal policy.\n\nThe U.S. Open cited the \"U.S. government's position regarding travel into the country for unvaccinated non-U.S. citizens\" to bar from this year's tournament unvaccinated Novak Djokovic, who just won Wimbledon and needs just one more Grand Slam singles title to tie Rafael Nadal for the all-time lead.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee blasted the president to the Daily Mail for the \"absurd\" ban on entry for unvaccinated foreigners.\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad questioned the basis for the ban, noting unvaccinated fans will be in the tournament audience.\n\n\"In case they don't know, vaccinated people can spread the virus readily,\" Prasad wrote in his newsletter. \"You could airdrop a million Novak Djokovics in the US, and the pandemic will proceed exactly as it otherwise would.\"\n\n\"Covid: so mild that the man on the left can 'work' through it, so dangerous that the man on the right is not allowed into the United States because of it,\" Berenson wrote in a tweet thread, contrasting the treatment of newly infected Biden to Djokovic, who recovered from COVID last year.\n\nTweet URL\n\nAnother user recommended Djokovic cite Fauci himself, sharing an 18-year-old C-SPAN clip where the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director advised against flu vaccines for those who currently had or recovered from infection.\n\nTweet URL\n\nU.S. regulatory agencies \"are all corrupted ... from their pharma involvements and control,\" Risch said, with the FDA and CDC advisory committees using \"cherry-picked\" data such as \"antibody bridging\" to demonstrate vaccine efficacy.\n\nShort studies with small populations, as were used to justify the latest emergency use authorization, are \"all tricks of the trade that drug companies have perfected to avoid being scrutinized for the harms that their products will eventually cause,\" he said."

        "The official regime news agency of North Korea accused America on Sunday of being “a vicious sponsor of biological terrorism throwing mankind into destruction” in an article echoing Russian government claims that Washington was producing biological weapons in Ukraine prior to Moscow’s expanded invasion this year.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), run by the nation’s communist dictatorship, accused American soldiers of “germ warfare” during the active phase of the Korean War, which ended in 1953, and speculated that the United States “is behind the malignant epidemic crisis confusing the international community,” apparently referring to the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nThe Chinese coronavirus originated in the central metropolis of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. No evidence exists of any diagnosed case of Chinese coronavirus anywhere outside of Wuhan — including Ukraine and the United States — prior to the first cases of the disease in that timeframe. Information from leaked Chinese Communist Party documents published by the South China Morning Post in 2020 indicates that the first confirmed case of Chinese coronavirus was documented in Wuhan on November 17, 2019.\n\nDespite this, multiple rogue regimes have attempted to accuse the United States of causing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have speculated that the Wuhan coronavirus originated in Maryland, citing lung injuries caused by e-cigarettes. Beijing has yet to reconcile the fact that lung injuries do not spread from person to person, while the Chinese coronavirus is highly contagious.\n\nChina has aggressively denounced theories that link the pandemic to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, known to be studying coronaviruses at the onset of the pandemic. A U.S. State Department fact sheet published in January 2021 indicated that “several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both [Chinese coronavirus] and seasonal illnesses.”\n\nThe Russian government, in response to global condemnation of its decision to formally invade Ukraine in February, has speculated through its own foreign ministry that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic was the result of biological weapons experiments in Ukraine.\n\nThe North Korean propaganda outlet claimed that Russian allegations against America this year support Pyongyang’s longstanding claims of biological warfare against the communists between 1950 and 1953.\n\n“This being a hard reality, the U.S. has denied their bio-chemical warfare crimes for the past seven decades from the 1950s,” KCNA denounced. “Lurking behind this is the U.S. sinister intention to cover up at any cost its atrocities of germ warfare, denounced by the international community, and to continuously expand the military biological potentiality.”\n\n“It is evidenced by the fact that biological laboratories run in camera by the U.S. in Ukraine were detected by Russia,” KCNA claimed.\n\nKCNA insisted that the use by Americans of biological warfare during the active stage of the Korean War was “evidently verified” by a mountain of alleged “evidence” including “an international fact-finding group comprised of prestigious scientists.” In reality, the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea were largely alone in accusing Americans of using biological weapons in that war and documents from both regimes surfacing decades late indicate that the three regimes were aware they were fabricating the claim without legitimate evidence.\n\nThe weekend column in North Korea’s flagship news outlet went on to accuse the United States of being the source of a variety of diseases, without offering any evidence aside from Russian government claims that America was developing biological weapons in Ukraine.\n\n“In fact, a lot of diseases including A-hepatitis and western Nile fever broke out and spread, timed to coincide with the execution of the U.S. epidemic research program in Ukraine, thus inflicting sufferings on people,” KCNA claimed, adding later, “It is by no means fortuitous that assertions are made that the U.S. is behind the malignant epidemic crisis confusing the international community. In fact, the U.S. is a vicious sponsor of biological terrorism throwing mankind into destruction.”\n\nAmerican officials have confirmed that Washington helped maintain “biological research facilities” in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of,” U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland confirmed in a Congressional hearing in March, “so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.”\n\nNuland did not elaborate on the nature of those facilities.\n\nRussian officials have enthusiastically promoted the claim that the facilities were biological weapons sites, claiming that they had seized the sites as part of the ongoing attempt to conquer Ukraine.\n\n“According to the documents [obtained in the seized laboratories], the American side planned to conduct work on pathogens of birds, bats, and reptiles in Ukraine in 2022, with a further transition to studying the possibility of carrying African swine fever and anthrax”, Ministry of Defence spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said in March. “The purpose of this – and other Pentagon-funded biological research in Ukraine, was to create a mechanism for the covert spread of deadly pathogens.”\n\nThe Defense Ministry later accused American scientists of housing “bat coronavirus” in the Ukraine laboratories, implying that America should be held responsible for the ongoing pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called the allegations of biological weapons development in Ukraine “outright lies” in a statement by spokesman Ned Price published in March.\n\n“This Russian disinformation is total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country,” Price wrote, an apparent reference to the North Korean claims from the last century. “Also, these claims have been debunked conclusively and repeatedly over many years.”\n\n“The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere,” Price insisted.\n\nNorth Korea intensified the anti-American rhetoric in its state media arms this weekend, apparently in anticipation of the anniversary of the 1953 armistice agreement that ended active hostilities in the Korean War. As neither side signed a peace treaty, however, the war between the two Koreas and their allies, China and the United States, remains technically ongoing. North Korean nonetheless marks the anniversary of the armistice falsely as “Victory Day.”\n\n“During the Korean War, the U.S. imperialist aggressors destroyed or plundered lots of historical relics and remains showing the time-honored history of the Korean nation and its wisdom and talents,” KCNA proclaimed on Monday, publishing an extensive list of alleged cultural sites the Americans destroyed. “The facts show that the U.S. imperialists are a strangler of human civilization.”\n\nNorth Korea is a communist regime run by the cultish Kim family, whose patriarch, Kim Il-sung founded the country and mandated worship of his family. His grandson, Kim Jong-un, is currently the country’s dictator.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

        "Europe is suffering temperatures of over 40C with the UK setting an all-time record\n\nHundreds of people have died due to heat in Spain and Portugal over the past week as Europe continues to battle temperatures of above 40C.\n\nIn Spain, 510 people fell victim to the heatwave between July 10 and July 16, Spain’s Carlos III Institute’s numbers show.\n\nOn Monday, heat in certain areas of the country exceeded 43 degrees. According to officials, ongoing forest fires caused by the heat have destroyed between 12,000 and 15,000 hectares and prompted the evacuation of about 3,000 people.\n\nIn Portugal, extreme temperatures claimed the lives of 659 people over the past week, most of whom were elderly.\n\nThe country is also suffering from devastating wildfires. On July 15, a pilot died in a crash involving a firefighting plane.\n\nFrance and Greece are also experiencing temperatures of over 40 degrees. The French Health Ministry has not shared information on heat-wave casualties so far but is expected to do so at the end of the month. On Wednesday, the heat is expected to decrease both in France and in the neighboring UK.\n\nIn Britain, last night was officially the hottest on record with the temperature reaching 25.8 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, temperatures in the UK breached 40C for the first time since 1922, when records began. At 12.50pm, the meteorological office recorded 40.2C at Heathrow Airport. The UK National Health Service warned of inevitable deaths from heat-related causes.\n\nAs temperatures continue to soar in many areas, Britons have been warned to travel only when “absolutely necessary.” Due to a large number of fires in the capital, the London Fire Brigade has declared a “major incident.”."

        "The Sri Lankan Health Ministry on Monday asked residents to resume using face masks, social distancing, and aggressive hand washing to control the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nSri Lanka has been wracked with massive protests for weeks, during which there was little evidence of masking or social distancing, and the government has collapsed so thoroughly that people are more worried about food and fuel than masks.\n\nHealth Minister Janaka Chandragupta and Deputy Director-General of Health Services Dr. Hemantha Herath warned that coronavirus cases are rising on the beleaguered island, with 56 new cases reported on Sunday, so the resumption of social distancing measures was requested.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka mandated the wearing of masks in early 2020 but discontinued the requirement on June 10 of this year after vaccination rates reached 55 percent. Chandragupta told residents to get a fourth vaccination shot as quickly as possible, in addition to resuming mask usage.\n\nAdding to Sri Lanka’s many woes is a fast-spreading outbreak of dengue, a virus most commonly spread through mosquitoes. 8,200 new cases of dengue have been reported so far in July, a situation described by National Dengue Control Unit director Dr. Sudatha Samraweera as a “dangerous” and “severe” epidemic.\n\nMonday was declared “Dengue Day” in Sri Lanka, an event the island has held several times in the past during major surges of the fever. Dengue Days are dedicated to clearing areas where mosquitoes breed, repairing protective screens, and similar precautions.\n\nThere are still protesters on the streets because they wanted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign and make a clean sweep of the island’s corrupt and irresponsible socialist government — but, instead, Wickremesinghe became the new president last week following the departure of dynastic ruler Gotabaya Rajapaksa. A crackdown on protesters using police and military forces was among Wickremesinghe’s first acts in office.\n\nSri Lanka’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism, especially Chinese tourism — an industry devastated by the arrival of the Wuhan coronavirus in 2020. Wickremesinghe is openly pleading with Beijing for help, including more purchases of Sri Lankan tea and spice exports and more Chinese investment in local enterprises.\n\nPerhaps worried that Chinese tourism is unlikely to recover as long as the island is seen as having a coronavirus problem, Sri Lanka began aggressively courting Indian tourists in early July, including a planned series of traveling roadshows extolling the virtues of Sri Lankan scenery and culture.\n\nAustralia’s ABC News noted that Sri Lankans living in Australia spent the past week packing up groceries to send home to their relatives, so they apparently have little confidence in Wickremesinghe’s ability to avert an economic meltdown. Charitable donations of food and medicine are flowing back to the island from Sri Lankan communities abroad.\n\nSri Lankan emigrants who spoke with ABC expected the new president to invest more effort in controlling protesters than feeding them. Some activists glumly noted that it was best to send the folks back in Sri Lanka food they could easily prepare without electricity since the power grid is teetering on the brink of collapse."

        "Australia reported 5,450 hospitalizations due to the Wuhan coronavirus on Monday, a record high that doctors say is driven by the highly contagious BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of the omicron strain.\n\n“The number of those in hospitals is the highest since the emergence of the coronavirus, exceeding January’s high of 5,390 during the first wave of Omicron infections. Daily death tolls have also risen, topping 100 on Saturday for the first time,” Reuters noted.\n\nOver a thousand outbreaks have been reported in retirement homes, which said they lacked the staff to deal with so many health crises, so military personnel were dispatched to reinforce them — an “extreme measure” defended as vitally necessary by Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles.\n\nAustralia has very high vaccination rates — almost 95 percent of adults have received two-shot full vaccination and 71 percent have taken booster shots — but the BA.4 and BA.5 strains so far appear to be vaccine-resistant, in addition to being highly contagious. It is currently winter in Australia, a season when the coronavirus tends to spread more rapidly.\n\nAustralia’s ABC News noted on Sunday that the nation now has the third-highest coronavirus death rate per capita in the world, “and the numbers are getting worse.” Health care workers are reportedly suffering under the strain of their third Chinese coronavirus winter and many of them are contracting the contagious omicron variant from their patients.\n\nThe general public is also suffering from “Covid fatigue,” as the UK Guardian put it on Saturday, which may have slowed the response against the third major omicron wave. Psychologist Chris Cheers said one manifestation of this multifaceted fatigue is people who are longing for more mandates and lockdowns because they are tired of making their own judgments about the risks and rewards of leaving their homes and interacting with other people.\n\n“They’re saying, ‘I need to stop. I need to rest. I need to have a break from this, but there’s these expectations that I just can’t act against,’” said Cheers.\n\n“We have to find a way to push back. To say, ‘no – things aren’t back to normal.’ At the time of a global pandemic, maybe this is the time to challenge some of those expectations about the way we should be living,” Cheers advised.\n\nOther Australians are weary of mandatory health measures, especially since they were led to believe that vaccination was their “ticket out of the pandemic,” as Australian Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly put it in another Guardian piece on Friday.\n\n“Last year, I definitely did not think we would be in this position. I definitely thought that with very high vaccination rates and what we knew about Covid vaccination and protection against disease from other variants, it would put us in very good stead,” agreed infectious disease expert Sharon Lewin.\n\nProf. Jason Kovacic of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute told the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) on Sunday that Australia faces “sobering, staggering numbers” of “long Covid” cases.\n\n“We’re looking at almost half a million people who are going to be suffering long-term symptoms in the coming months,” Kovacic warned.\n\n“At St Vincent’s Hospital’s long Covid clinic — which has a waitlist exceeding four months — the majority of patients are young, previously fit people, with women outnumbering men,” the SMH observed.\n\nAustralian researchers have found women are 22 percent more likely than men to be diagnosed with lingering “long Covid” effects, which poses a significant problem for the Australian healthcare system, where female workers outnumber men almost three to one."

        "Advertisement\n\nCovid death rates have reached pandemic highs in New Zealand as the country battles another havoc-inducing Omicron wave.\n\nWeekly virus fatalities hit 151 in the seven days ending July 16, compared to 115 in the worst week of the previous flare-up in March, according to Health Ministry data. It means the country's current mortality rate is twice as high as the UK's and four times higher than the US.\n\nIn the latest 24 hours, all 26 Covid deaths occurred among over-60s — the group known to be most vulnerable to the virus.\n\nOmicron sub-variant BA.5 is driving the current wave. Another 64,780 cases were confirmed last week, although authorities say the true figure will be much higher.\n\nOnce held up as evidence that it is possible to suppress the virus, New Zealand's swift response to the pandemic and its geographic isolation allowed it to escape the wrath of the pandemic.\n\nJacinda Ardern's Government dropped its zero-Covid policy, which saw the nation nicknamed a 'hermit kingdom', last year once the population was largely vaccinated, with eight in 10 people now double-jabbed. Since then, the virus has spread.\n\nExperts told MailOnline that previously low levels of infection in New Zealand due to strict Covid curbs is behind the high fatality rate now because the economically-crippling measures only delayed 'inevitable' infections that could have built-up immunity.\n\nCovid curbs introduced by New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern 2020 March 16: Mandatory self-isolation for all new arrivals, including New Zealanders into the country. March 19: All non-residents or citizens are banned from entering the country under an international border ban. March 25: Nationwide lockdown enforced, with only essential services allowed to open. At this stage, NZ has recorded 102 cases and 0 deaths. June 8: Ardern announces no new community transmissions within the past fortnight and says NZ has eliminated transmission of Covid. August-September: Auckland's 1.7million residents endure two months of lockdown measures after 4 new cases are initially recorded. 2021 February-March: Auckland re-enters lockdown as three new Covid cases are recorded in the community. August 17: All of New Zealand re-enters Level 4 lockdown measures for two weeks as one new community case is recorded. October: Traffic light system is created, barring unvaccinated residents from entering businesses, gyms and barbers in 'red' or 'amber' alert areas. December: The Government delays the planned reopening of its border in February due to the spreading Omicron variant. December 21: Length of stay for people in Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities increased to 10 days. 2022 January: Public backlash as major events and sporting fixtures are capped at a maximum of 100 people under Covid Red Alert measures. January 18: Government postpones managed isolation and quarantine lottery due to increase in Covid cases. January: Ardern announced she had cancelled her own wedding after nine new Omicron cases were recorded. February: Government announces plan to open up country with New Zealanders and eligible travellers from Australia allowed to skip quarantine as long as they self-isolate for 10 days. March 2: Vaccinated travellers entering the country no longer have to self-isolate on arrival. May 2: UK travellers and those from other visa waiver countries allowed to enter country without self-isolating. July: Government brings back free masks, tests and expand antiviral medication and step up booster rollout amid new wave of infections and deaths. August: New Zealand government to loosen restrictions to allow all travellers to enter the country provided they are vaccinated and take two rapid antigen tests after arrival. Advertisement\n\nData from Oxford University-backed research platform Our World in Data shows five people per million in New Zealand were dying with Covid every day in the week to July 21 — up by a third from the previous high of 3.68 in March.\n\nFor comparison, in the darkest days of the pandemic, similar rates in the UK and US sat closer to 19 and 10, respectively.\n\nHowever, both countries are now logging much lower death counts.\n\nThe UK is recording two deaths per million people each day, despite up to one in 15 people being infected.\n\nMeanwhile, the US is suffering just one Covid fatality for every million people, a quarter of the scale seen in New Zealand.\n\nUntil last year, New Zealand had been following a zero-Covid policy — with the population largely remaining virus free due to harsh lockdown measures, aggressive contact tracing and border controls that trapped some of its own citizens outside of the country.\n\nDespite fierce criticism from some in the country over the restrictions, Ms Ardern, the nation's prime minister, has repeatedly defended the rules, saying they saved lives.\n\nBut the Government finally acknowledged last October that it could no longer remain Covid-free.\n\nAt the time, the country of 5million had logged fewer than 30 deaths.\n\nMost of the final virus-controlling restrictions, including limits on gatherings and vaccine mandates, were lifted at the start of the year. International travel rules were only eased at the start of May.\n\nBut health authorities last week brought back free face masks and Covid tests in a bid to control the latest surge which has piled pressure on hospitals.\n\nCovid Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said there had been a 'significant' increase in cases since the start of the month weeks, with the biggest uptick among the vulnerable over-65s, causing a jump in hospitalisations.\n\nMore people are being offered antiviral medicine to reduce their risk of becoming severely unwell and another booster campaign is being stepped up.\n\nIt comes during New Zealand's winter, as the country experiences 'the worst flu season in recent memory' and health staff absences are on the rise, she said.\n\nDr Verrall added: 'The tried and tested measures: wearing a high quality mask, strong vaccine and booster uptake, antivirals and testing are highly effective and will put us in the best position to get through what is one of the toughest winters we've faced.'\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert based at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline that New Zealand has 'done better than most countries that initially followed zero-Covid strategies' because this approach meant many people had good protection against severe illness and death when restrictions were lifted.\n\nBut he noted that hybrid immunity — being both vaccinated and having a previous infection — seems to provide the best protection against severe disease and death.\n\nUntil this month a rather larger proportion of people in New Zealand had had just two shots and no prior infection, compared to the UK where the vast majority are thought to have had Covid, Professor Hunter said.\n\nHe added: 'I suspect that is contributing to the current death rate in New Zealand as being over twice that of the UK.\n\n'In the first New Zealand wave, vaccine protection was still good but has now waned enough to increase fatality rates in the absence of the great majority of people having already recovered from Covid.\n\n'It is possible also that BA.5 is more lethal than BA.1 and BA.2 but I don't think the evidence is definitive one way or the other on this.'\n\nProfessor Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University and former Government adviser, told MailOnline that experts have long said that it would be fairer to judge countries' responses two years on from the original outbreak.\n\nHe said: 'New Zealand was able to prevent early waves of infection by rigid border controls while other countries developed and tested vaccines.\n\n'However, in the end, the country has been unable to escape the fundamentals of Covid — that the risk of death is strongly related to age, that vaccination mitigates but does not prevent infection, and that the way out of the pandemic lies through population immunity acquired by both vaccination and infection.\n\n'New Zealand's policies may have displaced some deaths into other countries that developed vaccines but were really only delaying the inevitable deaths among their own population at a considerable cost to the economy.'\n\nBut Dr Simon Clarke, an infectious disease expert based at the University of Reading, told MailOnline that New Zealand has high levels of protection against Covid. Some 80 per cent of people are double-jabbed, compared to 75 per cent in the UK and 67 per cent in the US.\n\nHe said: 'Any population-wide immunity which could have been gained at the start of the pandemic, at the cost of a lot of deaths, would have dwindled away by now. We need a better understanding of the behaviour of the virus before we can reach conclusions.'\n\nA variant circulating in New Zealand may be less sensitive to vaccine immunity or the older population there may be in need of a booster, Dr Clarke added.\n\nNew Zealand's Health Ministry data shows emergency departments, general practices and medical centres are under pressure. However, hospitalisation levels remain below those seen during the March peak.\n\nThe Government is resisting pressure from some doctors to reinstate curbs on public gatherings or mandate the wearing of masks at schools.\n\nHowever, Education Ministry chief Iona Holsted said on Thursday the ministry had advised schools to enforce the wearing of masks as much as practicable when children returned from holidays next week.\n\n'We understand that implementing mask policies can be a challenge but ask that you take action to strengthen your mask wearing policy as soon as possible,' she said."

        "New Zealand is set to tighten its Covid restrictions and will hand out more free masks and rapid antigen tests as the virus threatens to run out of control.\n\nCovid-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall is expected to announce the measures on Thursday as the country battles an outbreak that is seeing more than 11,000 new cases a day.\n\nThe move to hand out more RATs is aimed at getting more people to test and isolate if they are found to have the disease.\n\nA masked person waits for a bus in Auckland as New Zealand battles a rampaging new outbreak of Covid\n\nPresently free RATs are only given to those who test positive for the disease, have been a close household contact, are newly arrived in the country or are a critical worker.\n\nNew Zealand has a 'traffic light' system to grade Covid warnings and currently the country sits on Orange.\n\nThis means Kiwis must wear a mask in many indoor settings but otherwise are free to live their day to day lives while being encouraged 'to protect vulnerable communities'.\n\nAt this stage the government has not indicated the country will move to the 'Red' setting, which is the most highest level of Covid restrictions.\n\nA woman gets her daily exercise in Auckland while wearing a face mask, which under the current New Zealand settings only have to be worn in some indoor settings\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern asked that people remain vigilant in wearing masks, getting booster shots and isolating if they had the disease.\n\nShe said the measures were straight-forward.\n\n'(Isolate) if you have Covid - that markedly brings down the infection rates of others,' she said.\n\n'Your household isolating with you is equally important. Mask use and vaccination. Those are three things that will have some of the biggest impact on our numbers.'\n\n'They are the most important things we can be doing right now, far and away above the extra measure [of] gathering limits which in this environment will not have the same impact.'\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister has urged Kiwis to wear masks, get tested for Covid and isolate if found positive\n\nMs Ardern, who was speaking from the Pacific Island Forum in Fiji, said Ms Varells would outline further measures on Thursday.\n\nHealth authorities are concerned many Covid-19 cases are not being picked up because wastewater testing indicated a wider prevalence than was being reported.\n\nOn Wednesday New Zealand had 11,464 new cases of Covid reported in the community and 29 Covid-related deaths.\n\nThe seven-day rolling average of community cases is 9710 – this time last week it was 7591.\n\nStaff wearing personal protective equipment check the temperature of patients in front of a medical centre in Christchurch, New Zealand as fears grow a Covid outbreak could overwhelm health resources\n\nThere were 67,926 active cases in the community.\n\nCovid-19 modellers say community cases could reach 20,000 in the coming weeks, which will likely mean many more deaths.\n\nDr Michael Plank told the New Zealand Herald that the country was 'definitely in a second wave' putting a strain on medical resources.\n\n'It's got potential to be quite a serious one. Hospitalisations are rising sharply now and that's concerning because the health system was already stressed with winter illness and flu,' he said.\n\nDr Plank said mask use would remain critical for flattening the curve of the outbreak.\n\n'We are probably still better at using masks here than many places who I think have fallen out of the habit,' he said.\n\n'That's not to say there isn't room for improvement because there is and masks will be crucially important for flattening the wave.'"
