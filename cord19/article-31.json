The orofecal transmission during colonoscopy has never been really demonstrated, so it is reasonable that colonoscopy is regarded as of lower risk in terms of transmissibility than the upper GI endoscopy. 3 Therefore, we have used surgical masks for colonoscopy since early June, which was proven to be effective in the pandemic, 4 and still wore N95 respirator for upper GI endoscopy, but changed back to N95 respirator for all procedures since the local outbreak.Under the modified ICSs, we continue to provide 1497 cases of elective endoscopy, including 5 cases of endoscopic therapy for early GI cancer, and also 40 cases of urgent procedures during the local outbreak. There are no local J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f outbreak-related cases in the work staff or patients in our endoscopy center.
