Method: Self-reported lonely individuals with AARP Medicare Supplement plans insured by UnitedHealthcare who participated in a program with a robotic pet (n = 20) were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about their experiences interacting with a robotic pet, their perceptions about the potential impact on loneliness, and recommendations for improving the program. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants' responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Constant comparison and consensusgaining processes were used to develop categories that later formed representative themes."

            "text": "Loneliness is generally understood as the discrepancy between an individual's preferred and actual level of social contact (Peplau, 1982) . One in three U.S. adults aged 45 and older report experiencing loneliness, with the total number expected to increase with the growing population of older adults (Anderson and Thayer, 2018) . Among individuals older than 60 years, loneliness is a subjective predictor of functional decline and death (Perissinotto et al., 2012) and adversely influences mental and physical health outcomes, including depression, quality of life, health utilization, and mortality rates (Cacioppo et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2012; Musich et al., 2015) . Social isolation, while related to loneliness, objectively assesses reduced social network size and social contact. Socially isolated individuals are at an increased risk for cognitive decline (Bassuk et al., 1999) , cardiovascular disease (Barth et al., 2010) , and mor-tality (Eng et al., 2002; Heffner et al., 2011; Kaplan et al., 1988) . Furthermore, social isolation in older adults is associated with reduced daily physical activities and increased sedentary behaviors (Schrempft et al., 2019) . Social isolation contributes to an additional $6.7 billion in Medicare spending annually, which is attributed to additional skilled nursing facility spending and increased inpatient spending. Flowers et al. attributed an additional $81 per beneficiary per month for socially isolated individuals admitted to the hospital. This increase in spending, while not necessarily accompanied by an increase in use of inpatient care, suggested that socially isolated individuals may be sicker when hospitalized, and may lack the support to transition out of the hospital successfully as compared to socially connected individuals (Flowers et al., 2017) . However, older adults who perceive their social connectedness more positively have better mental and physical health outcomes (Cornwell and Waite, 2009) . Given that is often impractical to address limited social networks, interventions may aim to address perceived loneliness to improve older adults' wellness and psychological well-being (Bartlett and Arpin, 2019; Krause-Parello et al., 2019; Schoenmakers et al., 2012) ."

For example, pet owners surveyed in one study were 36% less likely than non-pet owners to report loneliness, even after controlling for age, living status, mood, and residency (Stanley et al., 2014) . Despite these benefits, however, pet ownership may pose special challenges for older adults, including restrictions related to finances, mobility, transportation, and housing (Hart, 1995) . Given these potential barriers, robotic pets, also known as social robots, offer a potentially ideal alternative to owning a live pet for older adults."

            "text": "A robust literature in social science and technology has examined the implications of social robot use among older adults. Social robots, as defined by Brezeal, are \"designed to interact with people in a socio-emotional way during interpersonal interaction.\" (Breazeal, 2004 ) Several potential ethical implications related to older adults' use of social robots have been identified, among them reduced human contact, deception, and infantilization (A. Sharkey and N. Sharkey, 2012) Further, an incongruence between robot developers' perceptions of ideal features and those features actually preferred by older adult users has been well documented. Roboticists, who design and construct robots, often have a background in electrical or mechanical engineering. Further, roboticists often develop social robots without the benefit of feedback from the intended audience. Older adults are often regarded as passive users of social robotics, perhaps owing to stereotypes of older adults as lonely and fragile. However, this is seldom true, as both users and test users demonstrate active engagement with social robot models and consistently request robotic pet features capable of facilitating the user's desired interactivity (Neven, 2010) . For example, in a recent study comparing and contrasting preferences of roboticists and older adult participants, older adults expressed a preference for interactive features (such as life-simulation and personalization) that were not perceived by roboticists as having the same importance (Bradwell et al., 2019) . Thus, social robot developers often fail to account for the diversity of abilities, perspectives, and preferences among older adult users (Frennert and \u00d6stlund, 2014) ."

Social robots have been shown to reduce social isolation and increase conversational opportunities with the robot and other humans (A. Sharkey and N. Sharkey, 2012) Observations of participants interacting with robotic pets in nursing home and laboratory settings have demonstrated promise for supporting the social and emotional needs of older adults (McGlynn et al., 2017) and have yielded benefits similar to those achieved during animal-assisted therapies, including improved cardiovascular measures (Robinson et al., 2015) , reduction in loneliness (Kanamori et al., 2001) , decreased agitation, and an increase in feelings of pleasure (Libin and Cohen-Mansfield, 2004) . These findings position social robots as potentially ideal solution for older adults experiencing subjective loneliness. Cacioppo et al.

The first phase of the study consisted of a program evaluation in which a sample pool of AARP Medicare Supplement insureds who previously reported loneliness were recruited for participation in the study. Inclusion criteria for the study consisted of participants previously identified as lonely using either a screener that included the UCLA 3, or screener administered via interactive voice support (IVR) survey in conjunction with AARP's Aging Strong initiative. The intervention was offered to participants residing in the states of Washington and Michigan. Exclusion criteria included not a current enrollee in an AARP Medicare Supplement plan, less than 65 years of age, on the \"do not call\" list, not having a valid phone number, and ownership of a pet. All other participants were considered eligible for participation. Potential participants received pre-mailer scripts prior to an invitation to participate via telephone. Participants received the animatronic pet of their choice (cat or dog) in the mail and were instructed to treat it as a pet (Figures 1 and 2) . Three post surveys were administered (upon receipt of the pet as well as 30 and 60 days later) to assess the amount of time spent interacting with the pet. In addition, twice a week for 4 weeks, participants received an interactive voice reminder (IVR) phone call encouraging them to interact with the pet. The IVR phone call also asked participants to record if they had been interacting with their pet and if so, how much time on average they had been interacting with their pet."

Additionally, interview guide questions asked participants to describe any physical or verbal interaction with the pet, including physical touch, reactions to pet's audio or haptic functions, and verbal communication with the pet. Questions also asked participants to describe their motivation for joining the companion pet program, any feelings or emotions experienced as a result of interacting with their pet, including any observed influence on loneliness, mental and emotional health, and whether or not they named their pet. Several questions explored psychological and emotional well-being, including subjective loneliness, by asking participants to describe an average day in their life, perceived opportunities to feel valued or useful, and opportunities to spend time with marital partners, family, and/or friends on a weekly basis, as well as participants' satisfaction with those opportunities for social connection.

In a recent study comparing the preferences of roboticists and older adults, participants were encouraged to indicate their favorite companion pet model. While older adults in this same study overall preferred the Joy for All cat and its more interactive features as compared to less responsive robotic models, they still desired a greater degree of interactivity and playfulness (Bradwell et al., 2019) . Community-dwelling participants in our study echoed these sentiments, with many requesting robotic features that accommodated their lifestyles and reflected the degree to which they were able to enact an autonomous, independent lifestyle. The Joy for All companion pet models offer a degree of interactivity that perhaps signals a progression in social robot development. However, participant feedback further confirms the need for more advanced features that accommodate the needs of older adults, not as passive users, but as \"technogenerians\" adeptly managing technology to maintain health and independence (Joyce and Loe, 2010) . Younger participants in this study desired a model that offered greater responsiveness and spontaneity, expectations that defy the stereotype of older adults as passive users. Ideally, social robots functioning as companion pets should offer a range of function and interactivity to accommodate the widely ranging abilities and skills of older adults along the aging trajectory. Older adults' manipulation of robotic pets varies according to the extent of their cognitive impairments, with more impaired individuals interacting with the pet to a lesser degree (Libin and Cohen-Mansfield, 2004) . Accordingly, active and community-dwelling older adults will likely benefit from greater utility and diversity of functions to foster incorporation of the pet into their daily schedule and habits."

While practicing physical distancing contributes to efforts to flatten the curve, older adults may experience increased anxiety and depression as a result of limited travel and being restricted to their homes. A recent survey found the prevalence of psychological distress in a sample of adults in United States was higher in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic (McGinty et al., 2020) . Given new constraints related to physical distancing and their potential contribution to social isolation, future studies should examine what appeal and/or effect social robots may have for previously active, socially connected adults under quarantine.

            "text": "These study findings provide insights into the potential benefit of robotic pets for community-dwelling older adults interacting with the pets in their own homes, and demonstrate the need to explore applicability during pandemic conditions. Participant feedback yields supporting evidence demonstrating that robotic pet use may positively influence older adults' perceived loneliness and mental and emotional health, particularly for isolated and subjectively lonely community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, participant feedback potentially supports the notion that a robotic pet intervention may successfully meet two of the four points of criterion for assessing the efficacy of loneliness-reducing interventions (Cacioppo et al., 2015) in this instance: improving social contact and enhancing social skills. It should be noted that these findings are consistent across gender, as compared to previous studies disproportionately compromised of female participants. Given the variability of use and preferences among older adults, subsequent studies should include healthy older adults in the ongoing development of robotic pets (Frennert and \u00d6stlund, 2014) ."

Future research with communitydwelling older adults should consider the use of animatronic pets equipped with sensors that more objectively measure interaction and travel."

Longitudinal analyses are needed to understand how the findings of this study bear out over the long term, and whether mitigation of subjective loneliness among socially isolated participants bears out over time. While lonely and socially isolated older adults may derive benefit from the use of their pet, less is known about community-dwelling older adults' concurrent attempts to continue socializing with others. Potential ethical issue may arise for lonely older adults who become dependent on their companion pet for companionship or social connection."

Given participants may have been motivated by a desire for increased social contact and companionship, participant feedback may not be representative of a randomly chosen sample of older adults. Further, favorable impressions of the pet may be overrepresented in this sample."

However, robotic pets with limited functionality may fail to address the needs of active older adult users. Participant feedback suggests that robotic pets may yield the most benefit for subjectively lonely older adults living alone with fewer connections and subjectively lonely adults experiencing the loss of a spouse or pet."

Existing robotic models should explore ways of improving realism and the capacity of interactive play with their owners, and accommodate older adults as active, engaged users of technology. Future interventions intended to reduce loneliness may consider implementing use of robotic pets with increased interactivity. Finally, future studies should examine the potential efficacy of robotic pets in alleviating psychological distress for quarantined older adults with varying connectedness."
