Methodology. irty-nine patients with different mucogingival defects were included in this study for harvesting a free gingival graft (FGG) for soft tissue augmentation. Patients were randomly assigned into three equal groups: group I (MEBO), group II (0.2% HA Gengigel\u00ae), and group III (control). Postoperative pain was recorded by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Analgesic consumption was recorded for 7 days postoperatively. Wound size was measured at baseline and on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. Postoperative healing of the palatal wound was assessed by the VAS score for color match on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Results. Results of this study showed significant postoperative pain reduction for the three groups; MEBO showed statistically significant less VAS score compared to the other two groups, while HA showed statistically significant less VAS score compared to the control group. Both MEBO and HA showed statistically significant less total analgesic consumption. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups for wound size. MEBO showed statistically significant higher VAS for color match. Conclusions. Both treatment modalities could reduce postoperative pain following harvesting of FGG and improve the palatal wound healing. However, MEBO showed better outcomes in terms of postoperative pain and color match.",

MEBO is a pure herbal extract, which is natural in origin, containing beta-sitosterol, Phellodendron amurense, Scutellaria baicalensis, Coptis chinensis, Pheretima aspergillum, Beeswax, and sesame oil [9] . MEBO was claimed to have analgesic and antibacterial effect, while its beta-sitosterol component possesses an anti-inflammatory effect [10] . Sesame oil extract has a beneficial role in woundhealing, and its wound-healing properties may be due to the free radical scavenging and its antioxidant capacity [11] . 0.2% hyaluronic acid (HA) gel was known for hygroscopicity that allows it to maintain conformational stiffness and to retain water [12] . Another major feature is viscoelasticity that provides stability and elasticity to tissues and delays penetration of viruses and bacteria [13] . In periodontology, HA has been advocated as monotherapy [14] or as an adjunct to nonsurgical and/or surgical periodontal treatment to reduce inflammation and promote woundhealing [15] .",

Two concentrations are available for HA gel, 0.2% and 0.8%; however, in this clinical trial, 0.2% HA gel was used, since it was found to be more superior than 0.8% regarding the acceleration of the palatal wound-healing as reported by [12] . In the present study, MEBO was applied topically at the palatal wound site because, unlike currently used topical products, MEBO produces the necessary moist environment for optimal healing. MEBO provides physiological moisture for optimized wound-healing and reepithelialization and is also easy to apply irrespective of site, extent, and local condition of the wound. MEBO is pure herbal extract, which is natural in origin; thus it is neither irritant nor toxic to the oral mucosa [9] .",
