The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%) and diarrhea (33%). Ninety-five percent and 24% of patients required hospital and ICU admission, respectively, and 19% were intubated. After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died.

However, it tends to be more severe in persons aged \u226565 or with significant comorbid diseases such as cardiac, respiratory, kidney or liver disease, diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression, causing severe viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 3 . Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are generally at higher risk for complications of respiratory viral infections (in particular influenza), due to their chronic immunosuppressive regimen [4] [5] [6] [7] , and this may hold true also for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, impaired outcomes of patients with have been linked to the development of a profound pro-inflammatory state leading to ARDS. Whether chronic immunosuppressive therapy may prevent a worse prognosis in SOT recipients is still debated, as only a few cohorts of adult SOT recipients with COVID-19 have been reported, most data coming from single centers [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Clinical trials and observational data of larger populations of SARS-CoV-2 infected SOT recipients are therefore needed.",

Taking into consideration the total number of patients included in the STCS (more than 5000) and the number of patients included in this series, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOT recipients appears to be similar to that of the general population.
