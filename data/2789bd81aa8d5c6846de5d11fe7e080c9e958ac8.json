The integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) was incorporated into the pcDNA 3.1 mammalian expression vector expressing the codon-optimized extracellular domain of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein, and tested by immunizing C57BL/6 mice. Significant cell-mediated immune responses were characterized by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 51 Cr release assay and interferon-gamma secretion ELISPOT assay against RMA-S target cells presenting predicted MHC class I H2-Kb epitopes, including those spanning residues 884-891 and 1116-1123 within the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV spike protein. DNA vaccines incorporating the Spike-RGD/His motif or the Spike-His construct generated robust cell-mediated immune responses. Moreover, the Spike-His DNA vaccine construct generated a significant antibody response. Immunization with these DNA vaccine constructs elicited significant cellular and humoral immune responses.",

A fragment located in the middle of the S1 subunit (amino acids 318-510) constitutes the receptor-binding domain for ACE2 [Dimitrov, 2003; Wong et al., 2004] . The S2 subunit (which contains a putative fusion peptide and two heptad repeats HR1 and HR2) is responsible for the fusion between the viral and target cell membranes. These features make the S protein a suitable candidate for vaccine development. However, the level of overall sequence similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and the spike glycoproteins of other coronaviruses is relatively low (20-27% pair-wise amino acid identity), except for some conserved sequences in the S2 subunit.",

Unlike conventional vaccines employing either killed virus or purified antigens, DNA vaccination efficiently elicits cellular immune responses including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in addition to humoral immunity.

However, DNA vaccines are not without shortcomings. The mechanisms by which DNA vaccines generate immune responses are complex. For intramuscular delivery of DNA, the majority of plasmids are thought to transfect muscle cells, which are poorly or only partially effective at presenting antigen and priming na\u00efve immune cells [Nagaraju, 2001] . Instead, these cells are believed to produce antigen, which then transfer the antigen in some form to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via a mechanism of cross-presentation such that MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T-cell responses can be elicited. In addition, plasmid DNA appears not to be simply an inert vector for delivering the gene .",

Integrin receptors mediate adhesive events that are critical for specific and effective immune responses to foreign pathogens. Integrin-dependent interactions of lymphocytes and APCs to endothelium regulate the efficiency and specificity of trafficking into secondary lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues. Within these sites, integrins facilitate cell movement through interactions with the extracellular matrix, and promote and stabilize antigen-specific interactions between T-lymphocytes and APCs that are critical for initiating T-cell activation events [Pribila et al., 2004] . The integrin-binding activity of adhesion proteins can be reproduced by short synthetic peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. Such peptides promote cell adhesion when insolubilized onto a surface, but inhibit adhesion when presented to cells in solution [Ruoslahti, 1996] .",

DNA vaccines are mostly delivered into muscle tissue, which is poorly populated by immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, or lymphocytes. Myocytes constitute the dominant cells that express antigens from DNA vaccines, but they are not APCs. The expressed antigens must be presented to APCs (such as dendritic cells), which migrate to draining lymph nodes to induce immune responses. Mechanisms that facilitate APC uptake of antigens are expected to enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Dendritic cells phagocytose apoptotic cells through the avb5 RGDbinding integrin, which promotes cross-presentation of antigens. RGD fusion to synthesized peptide antigens can enhance the immunogenicity of the peptide antigens, which may involve avb5-mediated antigen uptake. Antigen-specific antibodies are induced by intranasal immunization with RGD-tagged antigens without adjuvants. In the present study, the RGD-integrin-binding motif was fused to the C-terminal end of the SARS-CoV spike antigen. The objective was to evaluate whether the short RGD tag could enhance immune responses against the spike antigen. Codon-optimized cDNA constructs increase protein antigen expression [Babcock et al., 2004] , and we therefore used codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike cDNA to express RGD-tagged antigen Zhong et al., 2006] . The spike antigen was expressed without the transmembrane and C-terminal domains, and with RGD fused together with a His tag for antigen purification and analysis.",

When the antigen was tagged with RGD, it exhibited a relative decrease in antibody induction, suggesting that either the RGD tag rendered spike protein less immunogenic or it polarized immune responses away from the humoral arm. The latter became clearer when cellular responses were assessed. With certain epitopes, S-RGD induced slightly higher CTL activation than S-His (Fig. 2C,D) . IFN-g secretion was also more effectively induced by S-RGD compared with S-His at an effector-to-stimulator ratio of 2.5:1 (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the RGD tag appears to polarize the host from humoral to cellular responses, which is congruent with the initial hypothesis.",

The spike protein is necessary for the infectivity and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Mutations in the spike gene correlate with altered pathogenesis, virulence, and tropism in other coronaviruses [Sanchez et al., 1999] . Zhi et al. [2005] identified the H-2b-restricted S436 and S525 epitopes, and concluded that the latter epitope was more dominant in C57BL/6 mice. The strength of these epitopes correlated with the binding affinity to H2-Kb as predicted by the SYFPEITHI algorithm. In contrast, we found that the S436 epitope was a relatively weak MHC binder with an MFI of only 1.23. Although S436 was ranked the highest MHC binder by the RANKPEP and SYFPEITHI predictions, the S497, S525, and S884 epitopes exhibited higher MFI values (6.58, 6.60, and 4.81, respectively) than S436. Two spike-specific CD8 T-cell epitopes were previously identified in C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), that is, dominant S510-518 and subdominant S598-605 [Castro and Perlman, 1995; Bergmann et al., 1996] . The dominant S510-518 epitope is located in a hypervariable region of the spike protein that appears to be readily deleted without loss of viability of MHV [Parker et al., 1989] . In comparison, the S436-443 dominant epitope resides in the minimal region of S1 required for interaction with its cellular receptor, ACE2 [Babcock et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2005] .

Babcock et al. [2004] speculated that amino acids 1-510 of the spike glycoprotein represent a unique domain containing the receptor-binding site. Additionally, He et al. [2005] characterized the minimal receptor-binding domain to span residues 318-510, thus providing further supporting evidence that a vaccine targeting this region is highly promising. Based on the results of the present study, the S436 and S497 epitopes that reside within this region are highly immunogenic. CTL induction by both S-His and S-RGD/His DNA vaccines kill RMA-S cells which were pulsed with the S436, S497, S525, S884, and S1116 epitopes. Furthermore, these epitopes also stimulated IFN-g secretion.",

Even though the S1116 peptide was predicted by bioinformatics to be a weak MHC binder, it induced the strongest cytotoxic T-cell response (Fig. 2) as well as the highest IFN-g production (Fig. 3) among all peptides tested. The S884 and S1116 epitopes are close to the carboxyl end of the spike protein where the S2 subunit resides. Wang et al. [2004] reported that a S1167 epitope (RLNEVAKNL) within the S2 subunit could induce peptide-specific CTLs in both HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Chen et al. [2005a] revealed that peripheral blood cells of recovered SARS patients with HLA-A*0201 recognize epitopes S978 and S1202 within the S2 subunit which mediates viral fusion with target cell membranes. Additionally, Tsao et al. [2006] identified S787 and S1042 epitopes to be HLA-A*0201-restricted. In view of our finding that the S884 and S1116 epitopes within S2 subunit were potent inducers of cytotoxic T-cell responses and IFN-g production, the S2 domain also represents an important target for vaccine development, especially in cytotoxic T-cell stimulation. Hence, the S2 subunit is complementary to the S1 domain, which has been demonstrated to be crucial for the development of immunogenic vaccines against SARS-CoV.",
