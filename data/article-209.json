These patients were broken down into two groups: Group 1 (30 patients) receiving standard care (corticosteroids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, pantoprazole, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir), and Group 2 (43 patients) receiving the above regimen plus TPE (replacing 2 l of patients' plasma by a solution, 50% of normal plasma, and 50% of albumin at 5%) administered according to various time schedules.

However, different harmful risk factors prevailed among patients not receiving TPE rather than being equally split between the intervention and control group. We used an algorithm of structural equation modeling (of STATA) to summarize a large pool of potential confounders into a single score (called with the descriptive name \"severity\"). Disease severity was lower (Wilkinson rank-sum test p < 0.001) among patients with COVID-19 undergoing TPE INTRODUCTION COVID-19 is an asymptomatic disease in most cases, but some patients develop life-threatening diseases characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MOF), extrapulmonary manifestations, thromboembolic disease, and associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (1) (2) (3) . Although the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is far from being completely understood, the severe form of the disease is correlated with overrelease of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2), which cause strong inflammation, endothelial injury, thrombotic microangiopathy, MOF, and eventually death (4) (5) (6) . The strict biological criteria to diagnose the CRS associated with COVID-19 remain however poorly defined (7) .",

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 were mainly dichotomous variables (e.g., sex). Table 1 reports only one of the two possible values, the complementary one being easily calculated by subtraction using the total figures (numbers) or 1.00 (percentages). Conversely, all the possible categories of polytomous variables (for example, O 2 support) are reported in Table 1 . Besides numbers and percentages, Table 1 displays the odds ratios (OR), estimated with an exact method due to the relatively limited number of study subjects, with the respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and the two-tail p-value. By default, the conditional maximum likelihood estimates were used in the OR estimation, except for those parameters (e.g., ICU admission) for which a percentage was equal to 100% and the upper bound of 95%CI was infinite. In such a case OR was obtained by median unbiased estimates. OR is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. The outcome was \"death\" in the analysis for columns 2 and 3, or \"TPE treatment\" for columns 5 and 6. The multiple categories of polytomous variables were coded as ordinal variables (0, 1, 2, etc.), but were considered as \"continuous variables\" in the context of exact logistic regression analysis; therefore, only one OR was returned by the statistical program.",

            "text": "Under the heading \"Distribution by vital status, \" Table 1 reports in decreasing order of OR value the risk factors for death from COVID-19 that were observed in our study subjects. O 2 support was the most important factor associated with death from COVID-19; worthy of notice is that no patient survived invasive mechanical ventilation by intubation. Admission to ICU and hospitalizations longer than 20 days came as second and fourth relevant factors, but they were believed to be collinear variables associated with O 2 support and no longer considered. Older age increased five times the risk of death (p = 0.007). Diabetes and hypertension were found to double the risk of death, although their impact appeared less important probably because of the few cases involved. Comorbidity (other than the abovementioned disease) appeared to increase only slightly the risk of death. Male sex and smoking did not play any role on mortality. The dichotomous variable \"TPE\" and the polytomous variables \"number of TPE treatments\" and \"timing of TPE\" consistently showed an important protective effect, suggesting TPE as an effective intervention that could protect critically ill COVID-19 cases from death. Data observed in treated and control groups are shown in the Table 1 under the heading \"Distribution by treatment status\" in the last three columns of the table. It can be seen that whenever an OR in the fourth column was higher than unity, it was lower than unity in the seventh column, suggesting that many harmful exposures (O 2 support, ICU admission, 65+ years of age, 20+ days of hospitalization, history of diabetes, hypertension, and comorbidities) prevailed in controls instead of being equally distributed between the two groups of treatment. The number and percentage of deaths in the two groups of treatment indicated 14% mortality in the TPE treated group against 47% in the standard-of-care group (OR = 0.19; 95%CI = 0.05; 0.64; p = 0.0049). However, the protecting effect of TPE could be due to some confounding characteristics of groups being compared rather than TPE treatment itself. Low frequencies and sparse data did not allow detecting a meaningful key of interpretation. Therefore, the problem was analyzed with SEM, estimating the latent variable \"Severity.\" Negative values of the severity score, based on arbitrary units, indicated lower disease severity, whereas positive values suggested higher severity of illness. Table 2 shows that the median severity was 7.70 in survivors and \u22122.80 in nonsurvivors, a noteworthy difference (p < 0.001). Moreover, the rank-sum test of Wilcoxon proves that the severity medians in treated (= \u22122.82) vs. untreated (= \u22121.35) groups were different (p < 0.001), even though the respective distributions were overlapping, confirming that treatment assignment involved a selection of patients by initial severity of COVID-19. As can be seen in Figure 2 , severity had a bimodal distribution with local maximal values of two modes corresponding to the median value of survived and deceased patients (red vertical lines in left graph). The graph of Figure 2 also shows that the lowest range of severity in survivors (\u22121.18, blue dashed vertical line) did not overlap with the highest range of Severity among deceased (5.66, black dashed vertical line).",

Therefore, there was no evidence that TPE was effective against mortality of COVID-19associated pneumonia. Figure 3 displays the balance plots. In raw data, control subjects had a more severe disease (requiring heavier O 2 support) and an older age with respect to the treated patients. These differences were reduced after propensity score matching, where matched groups appear to have approximately the same age and the same O 2 delivery support. Table 3 shows the SEM results; it can be seen that death was due to severity of the disease (beta coefficient = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.61-1.27; p < 0.001) rather than number or timing of TPE treatment, where effect size was not different from 0. As shown in \"Measurement\" the latent variable severity was mainly correlated with O 2 delivery methods (beta coefficient = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.56-0.93; p < 0.001) and age (beta coefficient = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.12-0.57; p = 0.002), whereas an inconclusive result (p = 0.061) was found for diabetes. The findings in the section \"Covariances\" demonstrated that Severity of disease was negatively correlated with TPE as a whole (beta coefficient = \u22120.42; 95%CI: \u22120.69; \u22120.134; p = 0.003); number of treatments (beta coefficient = \u22120.39; 95%CI: \u22120.66 to \u22120.11; p = 0.006), and timing of TPE (beta coefficient = \u22120.40; 95%CI: \u22120.69 to \u22120.12; p = 0.005), showing that treated subjects had initially a lower severity of disease.

Table 4 shows the results of Cox proportional-hazard models, where the hazard ratios (HR) measure the impact (i.e., the effect size) of covariates.

To rule out the possibility that any threats were responsible for the observed treatment effect, we used three statistical procedures. First, the effect of treatment was not different from 0 (p = 0.855) by using the propensity score matching to control for confounding. Second, the results of SEM showed that death was due to severity of the disease (beta coefficient = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.61-1.27; and p < 0.001), rather than number or timing of TPE treatments.

The before-and-after design must be used with caution because several circumstances, called threats to internal validity, bias the ability to correctly infer whether the intervention had the desired effect. Some of these studies (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) focused COVID-19-associated pneumonia or COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as endpoints, and TPE as the treatment. TPE protocols were quite heterogenous, the treatment schedules ranging from one to nine procedures, usually administered daily, but sometimes every other day. Fresh frozen plasma was specified as the replacement fluid for many, but not all studies. The duration of the procedure and plasma volume exchanged were also variable. TPE with replacement of convalescent plasma was suggested by Kesici et al. (34) as an early treatment option for patients with severe COVID-19, within the first week of symptom onset. Tabibi et al. (35) recommended further exploring TPE by clinical trials before using it in management of COVID-19-induced ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction. On the basis of these studies, no conclusions on TPE as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection can be drawn.",

(41) and in time for CRS resolution (p = 0.04) in the study by Kamran et al. (42) . These findings could be explained by either the treatment or pretreatment variables, or a combination of both. To form matched groups of treated and untreated individuals with similar or comparable pretreatment characteristics, the propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to both Gucyetmez et al. (41) and Kamran et al. (42) studies. After PSM, the two matched groups (TPE and non-TPE), each composed of 45 patients (36, 42) or 12 patients (41), had comparable pretreatment characteristics, and hence differences in the respective outcome became more significant (p = 0.001 in the former and p = 0.009 in the latter study). However, while in RCT randomization ensures comparability in both measured and unmeasured pretreatment characteristics, in PSM the comparability of the treatment groups is limited only to measured pretreatment characteristics included in the propensity score model. In Gucyetmez's study (41) , there were 18 patients treated and 35 patients untreated, becoming 12 in each group after PSM. In the Kamran's study (42) the corresponding figures were 71 (TPE), 209 (non-TPE), and 45 in each group after PSM. During matching, the closest untreated and treated individuals are matched and the remaining individuals that were not matched are excluded from the analysis. Exclusion of unmatched individuals from the analysis not only affects the precision of the treatment effect estimates but also could have consequences for the generalizability of the findings (43) .",

Primary outcomes were mortality at 35 days post ICU admission and safety of TPE in life-threatening COVID-19. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed no significant effect of TPE on 35-day survival after adjustment for relevant confounders, therefore aligning with the results of the present study.",

As the risk of developing severe, and even potentially fatal, COVID-19-associated pneumonia is extremely high in patients harboring auto-Abs against type I IFN, eliminating these auto-Abs by TPE emerges as an attractive additional line of treatment. However, a prospective RCT is required to better define its use (44), including the number of sessions needed and choice of volume replacement as additional factors in the analysis. The feasibility of this approach is contingent on the availability of a certified assay to detect and quantify neutralizing auto-Abs to type I IFN (44).",
