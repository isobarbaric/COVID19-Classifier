            "text": "Mobile and wearable technologies have promised significant changes to the healthcare industry. Although cutting-edge communication and cloud-based technologies have allowed for these upgrades, their implementation and popularization in low-income countries have been challenging. We propose ODSearch, an On-device Search framework equipped with a natural language interface for mobile and wearable devices. To implement search, ODSearch employs compression and Bloom filter, it provides near real-time search query responses without network dependency. Our experiments were conducted on a mobile phone and smartwatch. We compared ODSearch with current state-of-the-art search mechanisms, and it outperformed them on average by 55 times in execution time 1 , 26 times in energy usage, and 2.3% in memory utilization."

By using NLI, even users with low literacy and low IT skills can benefit from mobile applications as well [37] . NLI uses natural language to interact with an application and can solve the literacy problem that Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) present when interacting with mHealth applications [41, 53] . Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) systems are based on distributed servers or resource-intensive processes [28] . To enable reliable user interaction with an mHealth application, we introduce an alternative on-device approach."

ODSearch enables mHealth applications to search for users' Personal Heath Records (PHRs) using natural language, completely independent from the network itself. Several promising approaches have been proposed including an on-device natural language query interface [53], on-device classification [36, 55] , and on-device clustering [52] . However, the IR component, in particular the search function, is still absent; our work aims to bridge this gap. ODSearch consists of a pipeline of four modules: Query Translator bridges the language gap between the natural language query and the machine query, Bloom Filter, which queries the membership with efficient search space, Compression (i.e., Huffman Coding) which compresses and decompresses the stored dataset and thus facilitates the search, and finally, Answer Translator which presents the results in the natural language, computed from the machine query results."

Consequently, new scientific disciplines have arisen, such as mobile health (mHealth) or employing wearables for symptom diagnosis, and their popularity has increased from the Covid-19 outbreak [1, 20, 50] . As a result, the demand for mHealth integration into the current healthcare system is also increasing [47] . One primary application of mHealth is operating the devices as a data collection and repository for Personal Health Records (PHRs) [17, 33, 59] that are either manually entered by users [8] , or automatically collected by device sensors, such as physical activities [35, 65] and heart rate [46] . mHealth services provide affordable access to medical facilities, especially in low-income countries with limited resources [3] , which promises to improve the quality of healthcare in those regions. However, despite continuous efforts, mHealth has not yet been extensively adapted [4, 11] ."

They also analyzed and identified that the most frequently used databases in Android are SQLite, Oracle, and Realm.

Statistical-based approaches take advantage of each character's frequency and some popular examples are Run-length encoding [24] , Shannon-Fano encoding [19, 62] , Arithmetic encoding [49] , and Huffman encoding [31] . Run-length encoding can effectively compress consecutive repeated characters in a text. Shannon-Fano encoding can construct prefix code to compress symbols based on their probabilities, but it is challenging to achieve optimal compression efficiency [61] . Arithmetic encoding can approximate the optimal compression ratio, but encoding and decoding are very time-consuming [51] . Huffman encoding can approach the optimal compression rate if the frequencies of characters are very large [51] . Huffman encoding is also used in recent federated learning architectures [44] for reducing communication with the server while transferring neural network weights back and forth."

First, we extracted the three metadata attributes S, T, D from the original data in local storage, then we assigned the date of T as the key of the Bit Catalogue, and inserted S and D into the bit array, which is the corresponding value for the key. This approach makes each pair (date and bit array) unique and independent in the Bit Catalogue. When a user queries data of a certain period, it can retrieve all dates in the given period and use them to look for the corresponding bit array in the Bit Catalogue. If the queried bit arrays return any positive result, the algorithm proceeds with a query to the next step, which fetches all records containing the keyword. If none of the queried Bloom filters returns a positive result, the searched keyword never appears in the given period. Then, no further search will be done. In other words, the Bloom filter module operates as an 'initial filter' before searching the content of data files. This approach enhances the efficiency of the search and enriches the functionalities of the search framework."

For example, one of the query types is \"keyword existence\", which means the query only asks for the membership of a keyword; hence only Bit Catalogue will be queried, and subsequent search on the CLS will be skipped. After the keywords and the query type are identified, the \"Query Processing\" component, which consists of the Bloom Filter and Huffman Coding, will search the preprocessed data and return records matching the query keywords. However, before presenting returned records to users the \"Answer Translator\" decorates them and converts them to natural language text. In particular, the \"Answer Translator\" performs two tasks: (i) it calculates the query results based on the query type; and (ii) it performs natural language decoration on the query result. The computed result can be either boolean or numeric results. In both cases, they are decorated in a human-readable expression, and the final query result is presented on the user interface. For example, if a user query is \"How many times did I run this month?\", the query type will be \"keyword count\" and the query type calculator will return a numeric value. Assuming that the result is '7', the natural language decorator will tell the user \"You did it 7 times\", which the value '7' is wrapped in a human-readable text."
