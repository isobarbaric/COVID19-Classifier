Although cutting-edge communication and cloud-based technologies have allowed for these upgrades, their implementation and popularization in low-income countries have been challenging. We propose ODSearch, an On-device Search framework equipped with a natural language interface for mobile and wearable devices. To implement search, ODSearch employs compression and Bloom filter, it provides near real-time search query responses without network dependency. Our experiments were conducted on a mobile phone and smartwatch. We compared ODSearch with current state-of-the-art search mechanisms, and it outperformed them on average by 55 times in execution time 1 , 26 times in energy usage, and 2.3% in memory utilization.",

NLI uses natural language to interact with an application and can solve the literacy problem that Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) present when interacting with mHealth applications [41, 53] .

Several promising approaches have been proposed including an on-device natural language query interface [53], on-device classification [36, 55] , and on-device clustering [52] . However, the IR component, in particular the search function, is still absent; our work aims to bridge this gap. ODSearch consists of a pipeline of four modules: Query Translator bridges the language gap between the natural language query and the machine query, Bloom Filter, which queries the membership with efficient search space, Compression (i.e., Huffman Coding) which compresses and decompresses the stored dataset and thus facilitates the search, and finally, Answer Translator which presents the results in the natural language, computed from the machine query results.",

Shannon-Fano encoding can construct prefix code to compress symbols based on their probabilities, but it is challenging to achieve optimal compression efficiency [61] . Arithmetic encoding can approximate the optimal compression ratio, but encoding and decoding are very time-consuming [51] . Huffman encoding can approach the optimal compression rate if the frequencies of characters are very large [51] .

The first phase, \"Preprocessing\", focuses on constructing indices for the underlying datasets. It operates periodically, such as once per day, and processes the new data that was added to the system. This phase transfers the raw data from local storage to the Bloom filter and compresses it with Huffman encoding. Bloom filter constructs bit arrays for each day's data entries, which we call the \"Bit Catalogue\". Huffman encoding performs the compression on the original data, and stores it in \"Compressed Local Storage\" (CLS).",

First, we extracted the three metadata attributes S, T, D from the original data in local storage, then we assigned the date of T as the key of the Bit Catalogue, and inserted S and D into the bit array, which is the corresponding value for the key. This approach makes each pair (date and bit array) unique and independent in the Bit Catalogue. When a user queries data of a certain period, it can retrieve all dates in the given period and use them to look for the corresponding bit array in the Bit Catalogue. If the queried bit arrays return any positive result, the algorithm proceeds with a query to the next step, which fetches all records containing the keyword. If none of the queried Bloom filters returns a positive result, the searched keyword never appears in the given period. Then, no further search will be done.

However, there is no implementation proposal that execute the query on the underlying dataset. Therefore, we implemented \"Query Translator\" to bridge this gap, and it implements query classifications proposed by previous works [38] to construct the machine query. Figure 4 presents the workflow of the \"Query Translator\" and \"Answer Translator\" modules. Query Translator begins by identifying four query keywords: a question word, a subject word, a temporal notion, and an aggregation word. This classification and possible types of questions that users could ask about their PHR, have been proposed in previous works [53] .",

We take the query type to refine essential information of the natural language query and use it to control the \"Answer Translator\". For example, one of the query types is \"keyword existence\", which means the query only asks for the membership of a keyword; hence only Bit Catalogue will be queried, and subsequent search on the CLS will be skipped. After the keywords and the query type are identified, the \"Query Processing\" component, which consists of the Bloom Filter and Huffman Coding, will search the preprocessed data and return records matching the query keywords. However, before presenting returned records to users the \"Answer Translator\" decorates them and converts them to natural language text. In particular, the \"Answer Translator\" performs two tasks: (i) it calculates the query results based on the query type; and (ii) it performs natural language decoration on the query result. The computed result can be either boolean or numeric results. In both cases, they are decorated in a human-readable expression, and the final query result is presented on the user interface. For example, if a user query is \"How many times did I run this month?\", the query type will be \"keyword count\" and the query type calculator will return a numeric value. Assuming that the result is '7', the natural language decorator will tell the user \"You did it 7 times\", which the value '7' is wrapped in a human-readable text.",

Taking the average of both smartphone and smartwatch experiments on query a and query c, ODSearch takes on average 0.0007 seconds more than Bloom Filter alone, but takes 72% less time than Huffman Coding as expected since Bloom Filter is very efficient for membership query. ODSearch only takes on average 7% more time than Huffman coding for queries b, d, and e, indicating that the extra computational burden of the Bloom filter is very insignificant. Therefore, we combine them to provide complete functionality for queries and improve their comprehensive efficiency. Clearly, ODSearch is significantly faster than the Brute force method.",
