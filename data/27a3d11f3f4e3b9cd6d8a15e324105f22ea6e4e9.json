This study investigates the association between religious faith and intentions to become vaccinated against COVID-19 in Israel and Japan. Most of Israel's population is monotheistic, whereas most Japanese are unaffiliated with any religion. Therefore, our findings might be applicable to various countries that differ in their religions and levels of religiosity. We conducted almost identical large-scale surveys four times in Israel and five times in Japan from March to June 2020 to obtain panel data. We found that intentions of getting vaccinated depend on people's level of religiosity in a non-linear way. Those who have strong religious beliefs are less likely to become vaccinated than those who say they are less religious. Two other factors that play a role in this relationship are religious denomination in Israel and identifying with a religion in Japan.",

For example, Grabenstein [15] , who reviewed various religions, concluded that the main reasons for the willingness to be vaccinated is to preserve the general health of the community and the duty these believers feel to the community. More specifically, Judaism places a strong emphasis on the need to preserve life and maintain one's health. Indeed, the commandment of pikuakh nefesh, acting to save one's own life or that of another person, is such a strong primary value that it overrides almost every other Jewish commandment. Moreover, Judaism emphasizes the need to protect the community from disease. Thus, Jewish scholars applied this directive to encourage smallpox vaccinations in previous eras [15] . More recently, several senior rabbis in Israel have recommended taking the COVID-19 vaccine during the current pandemic (Globes, December 2020). However, when faith becomes strong, religious believers may place their trust in God or the gods and tend to deprecate human efforts to halt the spread of disease. This tendency might explain Henderson et al.'s [19] finding among Orthodox Jewish mothers in London, who maintained that their children did not require vaccinations because their health was in the hands of God.",

There are no gods in Buddhism, so the words \"trust in God\" may seem, at a glance, inappropriate. However, like other religions, strong believers tend to place themselves in the hands of powers outside of their control. In Japan, for example, one of the largest sects of Buddhism, Jodo-Shinshu, worships Amida-Nyorai (a Buddha who was awakened) and preaches that total devotion to Amida-Nyorai provides relief to everyone. With regard to vaccination, in July 2021, Sputnik News asked the chief priest of Shokakuji in Japan about vaccinations. He answered, \"In Buddhism, refusing vaccination is not considered a sin,\" taking a neutral stand on the issue. Given these observations, we speculate that those with strong religious beliefs tend to place less weight on medical interventions and more weight on God's help than those with lower religious beliefs. Therefore, our first hypothesis is:",

Inside each denomination there are subgroups that vary with regard to social structure, ethnicity, views regarding modernity and political views [22, 23, 40] . The four denominations are commonly used in Israel as a practical means of self-identification, based on a dichotomous religiosity scale.

Figure 1 informs us that most of those in the secular category are in the region where higher levels of faith promote vaccination, while most of those in the U_ORTHODOX category are in the region where higher levels of faith impede vaccination. The estimates of the denomination variables were all significantly negative, indicating that traditional, religious, and ultra-Orthodox Jews are less likely to buy the vaccine than secular Jews, even when their level of faith is adjusted. The estimates on the dummies representing religious and ultra-orthodox Jews were smaller than those of traditional Jews, indicating a decreasing willingness to buy a vaccine in the order of secular, traditional, and religious and ultra-Orthodox Jews, after adjusting for their level of faith. 7 These results clearly show that the denominations in Israel have additional effects on vaccinations after controlling for the level of faith.

However, the value of FAITH for most of the respondents was lower than the value of the peak, implying that for most respondents, a higher level of religious faith was associated with more willingness to take the vaccine, even though this association diminished. In Japan, the effect of the religion variables (BUD-DHISM, MONOTHEISM, etc.) on the willingness to buy the vaccine was weaker than the effect of the denomination variables in Israel, which supports Hypothesis 3. Nevertheless, in Japan believers in BUDDHISM tended to be more willing to buy the vaccine than non-believers, in line with Hypothesis 2. 9 In order to check for the economic significance of FAITH and FAITHSQ we again estimated Eq. (1) with the standardized regression. The betas of FAITH and FAITHSQ were 0.20 and \u2212 0.17, respectively. Their absolute values were larger than the other explanatory variables, such as INCOME (0.06), LIFE_15 (0.05), SEVERITY (0.12), PROB (0.05), RA (0.14), ALTRUISM (0.11), TRUST (0.04), BADHEALTH (0.10). The only exceptions were AGE (\u2212 0.42) and AGESQ (0.47). These figures suggest that the religious variables have some economic significance in Japan, not just statistical significance. However, the betas were smaller than those in Israel, suggesting that the effect of religion in Japan is weaker than in Israel, which supports Hypothesis 3. Table 5 presents the estimation results of Eq. (2). Our main concern here is whether the sensitivity of vaccine on faith is different in Israel and Japan. To determine if this is the case, in the leftmost column, we show the estimates of the interaction terms of faith and ISRAEL, i.e., FAITH*D_ISRAEL and FAITHSQ*D_ISRAEL. Both variables were not significant at all, although FAITH and FAITHSQ were significantly positive and negative, respectively. Suspecting collinearity between the interaction terms, in columns 2 and 3, we present the estimates when deleting either of the interaction terms, respectively. FAITH and FAITHSQ were still significantly positive and negative, respectively, at the 1% level. The interaction terms became significantly negative at the 5% level. Specifically, the negative coefficient on FAITH*D_ ISRAEL indicates that the sensitivity of FAITH was lower in Israel, which is consistent with the estimates on FAITH shown in Tables 3 and 4 (0.288 in Israel and 0.252 in Japan). Our conclusion is that the results presented in columns 2 and 3 are more reliable than those in column 1. The dummy variable representing Israel was significantly positive, reflecting the fact that the value of VACCINE was higher in Israel than Japan, as shown in Table 2 . Most of the control variables showed similar estimates to those in Tables 3 and 4 .",

Therefore, we explain only those that differed from the Israeli results. D_MAN was significantly negative, indicating that men tend to be less willing to become vaccinated. This finding is consistent with the literature reporting that men are more overconfident than women [3] . MARRIED was significantly positive. Fathers' education was significantly positive.

In both countries, FAITH had a significant positive relationship with this willingness, whereas FAITHSQ had a negative relationship. This result supports our first hypothesis. These results imply that those with low or moderate levels of faith are more willing to buy the vaccine. In contrast, those who have more faith are less willing to do so.

As Hypothesis 2 posited, we found that in Israel, denominations had a salient effect on the willingness to take the vaccine. Those who identified as ultra-Orthodox and religious Jews were significantly less willing than those who identified as secular and traditional to take the vaccine, after controlling for various attributes including income and degree of faith. This result suggests that the dogmas of the denominations matter. Traditional Jews, and to a greater extent, secular Jews, tend to emphasize being able to live in the modern, mostly secular world [37] . Secular and traditional Israelis tend to rely on the government's advice with respect to vaccinations. However, ultra-Orthodox Jews tend to be more isolated from others and adhere strictly to Jewish law, which, in some cases, creates tensions with modern society. For example, ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel and several other countries including Belgium, the US, and Canada have experienced outbreaks of mumps and measles because they have not vaccinated their children [9, 24, 34, 35] . Moreover, ultra-Orthodox Jews in London, New York and Jerusalem have experienced disproportionately higher rates of coronavirus [14, 20, 33, 40, 41 ].",

Second, we analyzed only two countries with a limited number of religions and degrees of faith. Nevertheless, Israel is representative of countries where most of the nation believes in monotheism, whereas Japan is representative of countries where most of the nation is non-believers. A larger study including more countries with various religions and degrees of faith to examine the relationship among religion, level of faith and the acceptance of vaccines would be welcome. Third, the relationship between the intention of being vaccinated and religion may depend on the types of diseases and vaccines. For example, as Padmawati et al. [30] remark, dietary restrictions might be involved in the rejection of various vaccines. Another good example is HPV vaccines, which various religions including Catholicism have avoided (e.g., [4, 5, 7, 32] ). COVID-19 is an infectious lung disease, which might raise different concerns than HPV. Thus, we recommend that future studies include vaccines for various types of diseases.",
