They were recruited through the social media in a \"snowball\" sampling, and filled out a self-administered six-part survey: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the positive and negative affect scales (PANAS), the Conor and Davidson resilience scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive symptoms, and questions regarding weight change based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Results: Routine physical activity (PA) was reported by 76.3% of the participants before the lockdown, 19.3% stopped exercising during this period, and 9.3% began exercising during the lockdown. The participants who were physically active during the lockdown period reported a higher level of resilience and positive feelings, and a lower level of depression, compared with those who were not physically active. People who were physically active during the lockdown maintained their weight compared with those who were inactive. Concerning weight change, 44.8% of the respondents maintained their weight, and a higher percentage of people reported weight gain than those who reported weight loss. Conclusions: Continuous PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were associated with higher resilience and positive emotions, and depressive symptoms, in people aged 18 and above. Although a causal link cannot be established, in light of the results of the present study, encouraging physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense of self-efficacy, as well as to maintaining weight during a crisis.",

Within a year of the outbreak, COVID-19 infected over 120 million persons worldwide, with more than 2,671,764 confirmed deaths [1] . In Israel, according to the last update of the Israel Ministry of Health (March 17, 2021, 08:49 AM) [2] , a total of 823, 314 had tested positive, and 6051 deaths occurred [2] . The sudden and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered the normality of daily life worldwide, and will surely have a long-term impact. On March 15th, 2020, a lockdown was imposed throughout the country. The entire K-12 education system and many jobs transitioned to online. Public places, restaurants, gyms, theaters, community centers, parks, and businesses were shut down to ensure social distancing, limit the movement of the population, and mitigate the effect of the pandemic. People could leave their home only if they were required as essential workers or needed to carry out necessary activities such as purchasing medicines or food. Although this strategy was reported to be efficient for containing the COVID-19 outbreak, the quarantine was also reported as being associated with harmful implications to society.",

The loss of freedom, financial cost, uncertainty over disease status, separation from loved ones, boredom, frustration, and inadequate information may create dramatic harmful effects [3] . Negative outcomes, such as suicide [4] , the generation of substantial anger [5] , as well as an increase in violence and aggressiveness within the family [6] , are just a few examples that have been recorded. Results of a review [3] of 24 articles concerning the shortand the long-term impact of quarantine on psychological well-being, demonstrated that prolonged self-isolation has a negative impact on psychological responses, promoting post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. In addition, quarantine might lead to physical inactivity, which should be of major concern as a great deal of evidence has shown that lack of physical activity (PA) contributes to adverse health changes, such as affecting the immune system [7] [8] [9] , depression [10] , obesity [11] , and sleeping problems [12] . Therefore, the potential benefits of a mandatory mass lockdown need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs [3] .",

Meyer et al. [13] , for example, conducted a cross-sectional study with 3052 US adults from all 50 states. Participants self-reported pre-and post-COVID-19 levels of moderate and vigorous PA, mental health and social aspects. Findings showed that PA was lower post-COVID among participants reporting being previously active, but largely unchanged among previously inactive participants. Lack of PA was associated with worsening mental health. Rhodes et al. [14] examined weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) frequency and duration of pre and post COVID-19 restrictions among 1055 Canadian participants aged 18+ years, and related psychosocial and environmental factors. Their findings revealed that participants had decreased weekly MVPA. Maher et al. [15] reported similar results among college students. They found that total minutes of PA were positively associated with positive affect before and during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Werneck et al. [16] focused their research on the association between depression and changes in PA and diet behaviors among 41,923 Brazilian adults. Their findings showed participants with a previous diagnosis of depression were at risk for incidence of unhealthy diet behaviors. Wang et al. [17] explored how COVID-19 affected the health-related quality of life (QoL) among 2289 Chinese adults who had been isolated at home for an average of 77 days. More than 50% of the respondents reported that their time engaged in daily PA decreased. During home isolation, 75.2% of the adults rated their sleep quality as very good, and 65% reported that they were satisfied with their QoL.",

For example, Dor-Haim and his colleagues [18] surveyed 1202 trainees who exercised on a regular basis. They found that 70% trained less during the pandemic period, and 55% gained weight with an average increase of 1.2 kg. However, those who exhibited a higher physical activity level gained less weight. The Israeli Center for Disease Control [19] conducted a telephone survey with a representative sample of 2580 Israeli participants aged 21+ to examine the changes that have taken place in the use of medical services, and in their mental state, healthy behaviors, and nutrition. In addition, it checked citizens' compliance with government guidelines from the onset of the plague to the quarantine following the second wave of the plague. They reported that 56.8% of the respondents regularly engaged in physical activity before the Corona plague. Of all those who reported regular physical activity, 65.7% reported that their habits had changed since the Corona pandemic. Of the respondents who reported a change in physical activity habits, 62.1% reported a decrease in the frequency or duration of their activity, and 46.7% reported a decrease in intensity. As for weight control, 28.6% of respondents reported gaining weight since the onset of the Corona plague and 24.1% reported eating more. Lastly, Zach et al. [20] examined the differences between Israeli adults in the age group 70+ and two other age groups (45-59 and 60-69) concerning their healthy and active lifestyle. They surveyed 1202 people and found that in adults at 70+, the physical activity level, physical activity before and during the lockdown, emotions, sleeping hours, and weight change were similar to the other adult groups that were examined (45-59 and 60-69). However, in the older adults groups (70+ and 60-69), resilience and depression symptoms were lower than in the youngest age group.",

The first lockdown's forced isolation and lower exposure to community life and to sunlight were both expected to be risk factors for a decrease in mental health aspects for Israelisprobably more than in other populations. Hence, the present study aimed to examine health behavior changes among Israeli participants. Specifically, we wanted to examine changes in the PA levels during the first lockdown imposed on the Israeli population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine their relationships with weight control and psychological health.",

Participants rated their feelings on a 5-point scale (1 = hardly at all or not at all; 5 = to a great extent). Reliabilities, in terms of Cronbach alphas, for the original scale were .89 for positive affect and .92 for negative affect [26] . Alphas for the Hebrew version of this scale were used in many previous studies (e.g. [27] ) ranged from .80 to .91.

However, due to the small number of participants in the extreme groups (losing or gaining over 5 kg), the categories were merged into five groups, as follows: 0%]kg. We examined the differences between the four categories of PA according to these five groups. About one-third to onehalf of the sample had no weight change. However, a The research integrates three domains: PA behavior, psycho-social aspects, and weight control during the lockdown. Therefore, a Multi-dimensional Clustering was performed (see Fig. 1 ) using the Euclidian distance between the variables. Figure 1 illustrates the group composite stimulus map summarizing the participants' scores on the three domains that were surveyed. As shown, the negative emotions (PANAS negative and depression symptoms) are not far from the origin and they are close to each other. Weight change is placed on the left quadrant, negative side, near the X axis, while PA is placed in the right quadrant, positive region of the Y axis. The positive emotions are assembled together near the negative Y axis. In other words, the location of the negative emotions is close to the beginning of the axes (0,0), meaning that they are quite low, but negative in relation to the other variables. On the other hand, the positive emotions are in the positive part of the X-axis but in the negative part of the Y-axis. That is, they have an opposite element to the negative (diagonally).",

The central focus of our survey was health behavior. More specifically, the focus was on PA habits. Two major results may have long-term implications. The first is that physically active peoplewhether or not they were physically active before the lockdownreported a lower level of depression symptoms compared with inactive people. This finding is along the lines of others who demonstrated the relationships between depression symptoms and PA (e.g. in a review by Kandola and colleagues [36] ), in the elderly (e.g. [37] ), in adults (e.g. [10, 16, 20] ), and in adolescence and childhood (e.g. [38] ). Moreover, our findings showed that not only was inactivity associated with depression, but changes in PA habits from being active pre-lockdown to becoming in-active during lockdown Fig. 1 Multi-dimensional scaling of the Euclidian distance between the research variables were related to increased depressive symptoms. Others [13, 14] found similar results in their studies, in which they examined the level of MVPA pre-COVID-19 to post COVID-19 and the associated depression. Both studies found that a decrease in MVPA is related to an increase in depression.",

After the first lockdown additional lockdowns were imposed, and the economic crisis following COVID-19 is expected to remain, even in the period after the epidemic is eradicated. In light of the results of the present study, encouraging physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense of self-efficacy, as well as contributing to maintaining weight during a crisis. Although a causal association cannot be established, we recommend that strategies be developed to enhance free PA in any future disasters/emergencies/catastrophic times. Some possible techniques are: using available free facilities in the public space (urban parks, gym equipment in outdoor public areas, etc.) and the private space (via the Internet). During lockdowns people should be allowed to carry out exercise in open space. Some of these conclusions were implemented in the second lockdown, in which people were allowed to exercise in open space. Organizations, systems and institutions such as the Ministry of Health, the health system, and the education system, together with employees, teachers and educators, should not only share these messages but also organize demonstrations of a variety of exercises for the population via the mass and social media. We join Neiman [8] , who stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-up calla tocsinto the world, in his conviction that primary prevention focused on health behaviors, including PA and weight control, is crucial.",
