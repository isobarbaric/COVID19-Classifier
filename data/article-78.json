This report concerns a 45-year-old patient who presented with abdominal pain and fever and would undergo a lengthy hospital admission complicated by a previously undiagnosed HIV infection. Computed tomography imaging performed the day our patient presented to the emergency room revealed rather classic findings corresponding with abdominal tuberculosis However, diagnostic difficulty delayed the diagnosis and treatment."

Our patient's disease involved the distal ileum and cecum, which is the most common location and represents 75% of cases [2] . Severe complications such as bowel obstruction can occur, and an inflammatory response can gradually result in ulceration and fistula formation, as was also seen in our patient's duodenum [3] . Immunodeficiency associated with HIV infection can modify clinical TB presentation, and radiographic presentations can be increasingly atypical in pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and disseminated TB [4] . Our patient suffered from this uncommon disease that presented \u2729 Consent has been obtained by our patient. * Corresponding author. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV and oral contrast revealed an abnormally thickened wall of the distal ileum ( Fig. 1 ) and cecum ( Fig. 2 ) , hypodense adenopathy in the retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and porta hepatis regions ( Fig. 3 ) . Additional findings included a small amount of ascites as well as mild gallbladder and duodenal wall thickening. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed mild gallbladder wall thickening and porta hepatis adenopathy with no other relevant findings. Our patient received IV fluids, antipyretics, empiric antibiotics, and was admitted to the hospital. His influenza and COVID-19 tests were negative. Despite a history of positive tuberculin skin test and prior negative chest x-ray, his interferon-gamma release assay test was negative. However, there was a concern for a false negative result, and further workup revealed a positive HIV-1 test with an absolute CD4 count of 10 cells/uL. Due to worsening respiratory status and elevated d-dimer, a CTA -computed tomography angiography chest was performed. It was negative for pulmonary embolus, although it revealed bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules ( Fig. 4 ) with a random distribution and worsening effusions and atelectasis."

An exploratory laparoscopy was performed to evaluate the ileocecal findings with wedge biopsy of the mesentery and was also nondiagnostic. A bronchoscopy with right lower lobe biopsy and right middle lobe bronchioalveolar lavage was performed given the computed tomography (CT) chest findings. This was initially nondiagnostic for TB infection, but the send out test would reveal rare AFB. Our patient periodically required supplemental oxygen, as well as intravenous fluids and vasopressors due to his declining condition. Blood cultures were negative over five days. He continued to have persistent fevers and leukocytosis, so empiric antibiotics were changed, given the course of the atypical infectious process. Due to growing concern for extrapulmonary TB, he was empirically started on quadruple therapy. Coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was also begun. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed and revealed a mass-like abnormality in the distal duodenal bulb with ulceration ( Fig. 5 ) and fistulization into the peritoneum. Colonoscopy revealed a patulous ileocecal valve ( Fig. 6 ) and severely ulcerated mucosa in the cecum and adjacent to the ileocecal valve ( Fig. 7 ) ."

Our patient's CT abdomen exemplified this pattern the same day that he presented to the emergency room. A deformed, incompetent ileocecal valve described as a \"fish mouth appearance\" or patulous can be a common manifestation on colonoscopy [6] . Although malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, and secondary infections were part of our patient's differential diagnosis during the initial workup, abdominal TB was of primary concern. CT findings can be non specific and the differential diagnosis for hypoattenuating lymphadenopathy can include malignancy, cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome related to celiac sprue, and Whipple disease [7] . An ulcerative pattern commonly affects the jejunum and ileum and can bleed, perforate, or form fistulas [8] . Although representing a less common location, our patient demonstrated this pattern in the distal duodenal bulb and was visualized on the CT abdomen as mild duodenal wall thickening."

They demonstrated a false negative interferon-gamma release assay test, multiple negative biopsies, cultures, and stains for AFB from mesentery, bronchus, and ascites before EGD and colonoscopy confirmed stains positive for AFB 11 days after admission. Although quadruple therapy was initiated before the final diagnosis, it proved challenging and elusive. This was likely due to our patient's profoundly low CD4 count of 10 cells/uL. This unique case allows the radiologist to raise clinical suspicion early in patient care-particularly considering the diagnostic challenges-to help clinicians begin timely treatment. In the setting of less pronounced or even non classic imaging presentations, experienced radiologists could also be deceived. Although abdominal tuberculosis is a rare entity, radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of it and consider it in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient suspected of an abdominal infectious or neoplastic process."
