            "text": "Pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then named coronavirus disease 2019 . Most patients experience mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, i.e., fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, but some patients with underlying health disorders, such as respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, can develop severe illness and even die [1] . A small proportion of COVID-19 cases are also reported without any symptoms but with positive viral nucleic acid test results [2] . COVID-19 transmits mainly via respiratory droplets and direct contact [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 is within 14 days with a mean time of 5.2 days, and the mean basic reproductive number (R 0 ) ranges from 1.4 to 3.9 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Due to the long incubation period and high infectivity, COVID-19 cases can accumulate unidentified, and the high proportion of severe cases that come later may quickly overload the health system, consume local health resources, and cause large numbers of mortalities [8] [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 12 March 2020. As of 30 August 2020, the epidemic of COVID-19 had affected more than 200 countries and regions, with more than 20 million confirmed cases worldwide."

However, the lack of vaccine and coverage remains a challenge due to insufficient production and allocation. To date, public health intervention is still one of the most efficient ways to control the development of the COVID-19 pandemic [12, 13] . Studying the spatial patterns and influencing factors for COVID-19 is important to identify high-risk areas for further intervention and risk evaluation for local prevention and control strategy development. Additionally, health resources can be allocated in advance to prepare for the peak of incoming patients with severe illness. The distribution of COVID-19 shows significant spatial heterogeneity [14] . The occurrence and transmission of COVID-19 in the population may be influenced by natural, environmental, and social factors [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

This study investigated the spatial distribution of COVID-19 and its relationship with potential influencing factors in China. The results revealed that the areas with a high risk of COVID-19 were in the vicinity of Hubei Province and in the provinces with high economic development, as well as Heilongjiang, Hainan, and Ningxia Province. The proportion of spatial autocorrelation variation in the total variation was reduced from 99.75% to 21.51% by including socioeconomic covariates. Most of the variation in COVID-19 could be explained by socioeconomic factors, which indicated that socioeconomic factors might play important role at the early stage of the pandemic. The per capita consumption expenditure and the proportion of the migrating population from Hubei were positively correlated with the disease risk of COVID-19. These findings can be helpful for the control and prevention of the potential epidemics and emergencies in the future. Several policies such as home quarantine, lockdown, and social distancing were taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These policies varied by regions and their impacts on the COVID-19 pandemic were different. For instance, the traffic blockade in Wuhan city delayed the development of COVID-19 in China [24] . While in others provinces except Hubei, the managements such as home quarantine of migrating population of other regions had played a great role in controlling the local epidemics. However, the effects of these measures were not considered in our study due to the difficulty of quantifying these measures. Further research is needed to explore such impacts of the differences in local policies. Besides, the uncertainty of our study should be mentioned. The COVID-19 cases in our study were collected from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, which diagnosed and reported timely according to the prevention and control plan of Novel coronavirus pneumonia [25] . The socioeconomic factors were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook. However, the impacts of the local policies were not considered in this study due to the lack of method to quantify different local policies. Further research is needed to explore the impacts of the local policies. The high-risk areas of COVID-19 were mainly in eastern and southern China, which was probably associated with population mobility [26, 27] . The COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and coincided with the Spring Festival transport season in 2020. Due to the high infectivity and long incubation period of COVID-19, as well as the lack of prevention and control management before the emergency response was launched, infected individuals and COVID-19 patients spread to other provinces, causing in the COVID-19 epidemic to spread across the provinces that received numerous people from Hubei. From the beginning of the Spring Festival transport season to the 2nd day of the traffic blockade in Wuhan, over half of the outflowing population from Hubei went to adjacent provinces, thus increasing the local risks. The adjacent provinces included Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Chongqing, and Anhui. However, high COVID-19 risk was still associated with high per capita consumption expenditure even controlling with the proportion of the migrating population from Hubei. These provinces with high socioeconomic development (Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu) had higher inflow populations during the Spring Festival transport season than other provinces. The proportion of the population from Hubei in these provinces only reflected the imported population from Hubei. The cases imported through transit might be indirectly reflected in the per capita consumption expenditure."

Notably, the correlation between COVID-19 risk and population density or foreign exchange earnings from international tourism was not statistically significant after controlling for the influence of the proportion of population from Hubei. The reason might be that the implementation of the national emergency response at the end of January 2020 reduced the local COVID-19 exposure by implementing household restrictions and the wearing of masks. Then, the community transmission of COVID-19 was controlled [29, 30] , and as were the effects of local population density. This result suggested that the emergency response measures adopted in China sufficiently controlled the community transmission. Besides, the foreign exchange earnings from international tourism partly reflecting the international imported population, were found to be nonsignificant, as there were only a few infected individuals and COVID-19 patients at the early stage. However, with the increasing global threats, more attention should be paid to the risk of imported cases."

Some COVID-19 patients did not adherence to the prevention measures and even concealed their visits to Wuhan or close contact with people from Wuhan. Such behaviors led to clustered cases and increase the local RR.
