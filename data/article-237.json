            "text": "The National Health Systems have been severely stressed out by the COVID-19 pandemic because 14% of patients require hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Relationship between COVID-19 prognosis and the extent of alterations on chest CT obtained by both visual and software-based quantification that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one has been proven. While commercial applications for automatic medical image computing and visualization are expensive and limited in their spread, the open-source systems are characterized by not enough standardization and time-consuming troubles. We analyzed chest CT exams on 246 patients suspected of COVID-19 performed in the Emergency Department CT room. The lung parenchyma segmentation was obtained by a threshold-based method using the open-source 3D Slicer software and software tools called \"Segment Editor\" and \"Segment Quantification.\" For the three main characteristics analyzed on lungs affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, a specifical densitometry value range was defined: from \u2212 950 to \u2212 700 HU for well-aerated parenchyma; from \u2212 700 to \u2212 250 HU for interstitial lung disease; from \u2212 250 to 250 HU for parenchymal consolidation. For the well-aerated parenchyma and the interstitial alterations, the procedure was semi-automatic with low time consumption, whereas consolidations' analysis needed manual interventions by the operator. After the chest CT, 13% of the sample was admitted to intensive care, while 34% of them to the sub-intensive care. In patients moved to intensive care, the parenchyma analysis reported a higher crazy paving presentation. The quantitative analysis of the alterations affecting the lung parenchyma of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can be performed by threshold method segmentation on 3D Slicer. The segmentation could have an important role in the quantification in different COVID-19 pneumonia presentations, allowing to help the clinician in the correct management of patients."

Furthermore, the study of Colombi et al. [8] suggests that both visual and software-based quantification of the well-aerated lung on chest CT obtained in the emergency setting were independent predictors of ICU admission or death in patients with COVID-19 and that quantitative assessment of the extent of lung involvement by COVID-19 pneumonia may be useful for routine patient management."

Moreover, CT quantification of the well-aerated lung was shown to be helpful either to estimate the alveolar recruitment during ventilation or to predict the prognosis of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [17, 18] . However, commercial applications for totally automatic medical image computing and visualization are typically expensive specialized hardware/software and limited in their spread [19] .

During the application of the COVID-19 interstitial alteration filter, part of the peribronchovascular space, inner part of trachea/bronchi, and pleura are inevitably included (and added to the total interstitial alterations volume). Our experience documented that this volume is variable, but it was about 45 ml on average. Alterations such as diffuse fibrosis or images with breath artifacts lungs can change this value. 3. The tertiary bronchi are included within the healthy parenchyma during the segmentation provided in a negligible total volume (< 20 ml). Segmentation at this level is difficult due to the size of the bronchi at the parenchymal level. 4. Consolidation was selected manually. As mentioned above, parts of the venous and arterial vessels are involved in the volume. Excluding this mistake is difficult because of the nature itself. The use of the command paints with values of dimensions smaller than the sphere of 10 mm is recommended for accuracy of evaluation. 5. Only one software has been used for lung segmentation."

            "text": "The quantitative analysis of the alterations affecting the lung parenchyma of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can be easily performed by the open-source software Sliced 3D. The well-ventilated parenchyma and interstitial alterations such as ground glass opacity and crazy paving have reliable densitometric thresholds and are operationally fast procedures that require little manual intervention by the operator. On the other hand, consolidation and fibrosis fall within thresholds of densitometric values that are not well standardized and require more intervention by the operator, despite being not extensive in most cases. An important consequence of the segmentation was the quantification of the different COVID-19 pneumonia presentation. Radiologist, with this tool, could help the clinician to a better patient stratification. Further studies might explore an eventual prognostic role based on the disease quantification."
