In the last 3 weeks of March, however, lending grew more than 6% per week (about 50 times the average). The growth in lending during these 3 weeks exceeded every other weekly growth rate going all the way back to 1973, when the Federal Reserve's H.8 releases (Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the U.S.) began (see Figure 1 ). 1 The 3 weeks in March 2020 are an unprecedented \"stress test\" on the ability of banks to supply liquidity. The test, induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, was unexpected to most firms and banks, nonfinancial in nature, and affected all industries and regions in the economy. In this paper, we study how bank characteristics and the characteristics of the markets they serve explain the cross-section of this explosion in lending. Our evidence suggests that all of the increase in lending occurred through drawdowns on existing credit commitments. Large banks experienced much greater drawdowns than smaller ones. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the drawdowns came mainly from large firms, who typically borrow from the largest banks. 2 As a result, C&I lending grew much faster for banks with assets Weekly growth in C&I loans on bank balance sheets: January 1973-April 2020 over $50 billion than for other banks (Figure 2 ). We do not find robust evidence that banks' financial condition before the onset of the crisis constrained their lending. Thus, most banks passed this liquidity stress test.",

Viral outbreaks varied substantially across localities, with some cities experiencing large outbreaks, such as New York, New Orleans, and Detroit, and others experiencing smaller ones. State and local governments responded differently to the pandemic, both in the intensity and in the timing of lockdowns and other measures aimed at slowing the spread of the infectious disease. For example, California initiated stay-at-home orders early on in the crisis, whereas other states, such as Texas, initiated such public health measures weeks later. We measure the size of local outbreaks using two strategies, one based on local employment declines in small firms, and the other by ex post death rates from the COVID-19. We show much larger increases in lending at banks located near large outbreaks.",

            "text": "Second, does bank preshock financial condition constrain their ability to meet the unexpected increase in liquidity demands from their business clientele? To answer this question, we build off models developed by Cornett et al. (2011) , who study a related phenomenon during the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. Cornett et al. (2011) find that banks adjust to shocks to liquidity demands by reducing new credit origination, and that the changes in credit supply depend on banks' financial constraints. Specifically, in the 2007-2009 period, banks more reliant on core deposits, banks holding more liquid assets, and banks with more capital cut new lending less (increased lending more) than other banks. Our research tests whether or not these bank financial conditions have affected liquidity supply in response to the COVID-19 crisis. 3 We show that the advent of the COVID-19 crisis explains the increase in lending, as banks located near areas with larger outbreaks experienced faster loan growth. Large banks with high levels of unused loan commitments to business experienced by far the largest increases in lending. These banks, however, were able to fund the liquidity demands due to the massive increase in deposits and cash, which each grew by about $1 trillion in aggregate during the crisis weeks, twice as much as the aggregate increase in lending. Our cross-bank regressions find little evidence that lending grew more at banks financed more with stable deposits before the crisis. Similarly, we do not find robust evidence that precrisis measures of asset liquidity explain increases in lending. These two \"nonresults\" suggest that concern about liquidity posed no constraint on banks, in stark contrast to what happened during the 2008 crisis. Moreover, we find little evidence that bank capital constrained their lending either. Again, in contrast to 2008, bank lending did not vary robustly with capital in response to the COVID-19 crisis.",

The Q4 2019 Call Report provides detailed measures of bank financial condition at the outset of the crisis, which we use to explain lending growth during Q1 2020. Since lending exploded during the last 3 weeks of March (recall Figures 1 and 2) , the bulk of the loan-growth variation during Q1 2020 represents the effects of the liquidity shock during these 3 weeks. Hence, we exploit weekly growth in bank lending using the confidential FR 2644 data that underlie the Federal Reserve's H.8 releases. These are the only data that permit high-frequency analysis of the precise timing of the expansion of lending across banks. We construct all of our estimates within-bank (i.e., with bank fixed effects) to remove unobserved heterogeneity in bank lending patterns observed during normal (noncrisis) conditions.",

Call Report data allow us to include all banks (rather than just the weekly reporting banks in FR 2644) and also allow us to model both on-balance sheet lending increases and total credit production (the sum of loans on balance sheet plus undrawn commitments). However, it does not allow us to pinpoint the exact timing of the liquidity shock. Our results across the two approaches are consistent, in terms of both statistical significance and economic magnitude. Our identification strategy assumes no correlation between precrisis bank characteristics and the liquidity demand shock that occurs in March 2020. While we see no reason to assume otherwise-the pandemic and ensuing market panic was certainly a surprise to everyone-we show that our results are similar when we vary the set of variables capturing liquidity demand. In fact, our results are also similar (quantitatively) in models using the Call Report data, which omit local demand covariates.",

Earlier research suggests that combining deposits and off-balance sheet credit commitments creates diversification synergies, which allow banks to hold less cash (Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein 2002) . Gatev and Strahan (2006) argue that the synergy is especially powerful during periods of market stress because deposits flow into banks at the same time that borrower liquidity demands peak. Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010) find evidence consistent with this latter mechanism during the 2008 crisis, although Acharya and Mora (2015) find that banks paid higher rates to attract deposits. Ippolito et al. (2016) find banks more exposed to wholesale funds (as opposed to stable deposits) experienced greater credit-line drawdowns during the European sovereign debt crisis. In this paper, we show that aggregate deposit inflows were more than enough to fund the increase in liquidity demands; these flows explain why the size of banks' precrisis deposit base does not covary with lending across banks.",

These models suggest that credit line usage increases when stock market returns are low (Berg et al. 2017) . Their analysis simulates aggregate loan drawdowns of $264 billion for the aggregate U.S. banking system, which is a little more than half of the increased lending seen in March 2020. They argue that banks overall are sufficiently well capitalized to accommodate this simulated demand for liquidity, but our data suggest the actual stress on banks has been substantially larger than the simulated one. In fact, Acharya, Engle, and Steffen (2020) show that banks more exposed to precrisis credit lines also experienced larger stock price declines than other banks. Despite the stock return performance, we find no evidence, based on individual bank lending behavior, that capital constrained their ability to meet this unprecedented demand for cash.",

First, policy makers seem to have learned the value of speed from 2008, when interventions occurred much more slowly, incrementally, and only in reaction to market events. In contrast, the tools developed during 2008, such as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and quantitative easing (QE), came online immediately and massively in March 2020, along with new tools that went beyond anything seen in 2008. 5 Second, banks received large inflows of deposits at the same time that firms were demanding liquidity from credit lines. Hence, liquidity supplied to banks became more abundant at the same time that liquidity demanded from banks spiked. Third, regulatory changes after 2008 initiated by international regulators through the Basel Process, by the Federal Reserve in its role as supervisor of Bank Holding Companies, and by legislation in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act all emphasized increasing capital for banks. Stress tests of the largest banks, for example, led to both substantial increases in regulatory capital and improvements in banks' internal risk management policies and practices. As a result, unlike 2008, bank capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimums by substantial cushions and therefore did not constrain banks' ability to expand onbalance sheet lending in 2020.",

As a result, capital may constrain future credit origination unless banks take immediate steps to lower capital distributions (e.g., dividends) and/or raise new equity. In fact, Blank et al. (2020) provide simulations for the future path of bank capital from the COVID-19 crisis, applying simple forecasting models developed in Hirtle et al. (2016) . These simulations suggest large declines in capital ratios, ranging from four to seven percentage points of riskweighted assets by 2022, with banks holding more than half of all U.S. banking assets breaching regulatory minimums. Declines of this magnitude could severely limit future credit supply.",

Moreover, the figure shows no unusual growth in other loans (e.g., real estate, consumer) during this time. Consistent with our interpretation, Acharya and Steffen (2020a) use data from S&P's Loan Commentary and Data to document that large public corporations drew about $225 billion on their bank lines during this period, which is only half of the increase in bank C&I lending in our data (about $480 billion). The difference probably reflects drawdowns by private firms. We use this unexpected shock to liquidity demand to study whether bank financial condition affected their willingness to supply liquidity. Having such a bright-line increase in liquidity demand is nearly unique; it allows us to trace out how (or whether) financial condition constrained banks' ability to supply liquidity. The weeks after Lehman's bankruptcy in 2008 offer the only other similar situation. Cornett et al. (2011) show that both liquidity and capital affected bank liquidity supply then. We report similar tests, though as discussed in the introduction, the increase in drawdowns during the COVID-19 crisis dwarfs that observed during the most intense weeks of the 2008 crisis.",

First, we control for the weekly growth in employment, as measured by total hours worked at small firms located in the state in which each bank is headquartered. 13 These data come from Homebase, a software provider for small businesses to track employee working hours for scheduling and payroll. As of January 2020, the Homebase data cover about 60,000 small businesses across all 50 states. About 90% of their clients have fewer than 100 employees. Homebase covers only a small fraction of total state-level employment, but has concentration in the leisure, hospitality and retail trade sectors, which are the sectors most hard-hit by the COVID-19 crisis. Because this measure comes from very small firms, it is unlikely to be directly affected by the drawdown behavior, which was dominated by large firms (i.e., it acts as an exogenous measure of local exposure to the virus; employment patterns at large firms might be affected by the availability of liquidity, which is our outcome). As a second strategy, we measure state-level COVID-19 deaths per capita through the beginning of May 2020. Doing so creates a comprehensive, cross-sectional measure of the extent of the viral outbreak. 14 The bank fixed effect captures the cross-sectional effect of this variable, so we focus on its interaction with the Crisis indicator. 15 Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample of domestic, weekly reporting banks in FR 2644. We also report the statistics separately for crisis and precrisis weeks. Panels B-D of Table 1 report the data sorted into three size bins: banks with assets less than $10 billion; banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion; and banks with assets greater than $50 billion. Table 1 shows the dramatic shift that occurs during the crisis weeks. Precrisis, bank lending increases by only 0.01% of assets per week (with a standard deviation of 0.22% of assets); during the crisis weeks, bank lending increases by an order of magnitude more (to 0.1% of assets), while its standard deviation increases by about 70% (to 0.37%). These figures appear \"small\" only because we normalize the change in C&I lending by the size of each bank's balance sheet from the end of the prior quarter. In fact, the changes in bank C&I lending during these 3 weeks are the largest since 1973 (when the FR 2644 data collection began).",

Two things stand out from this sample split. First, the effect of Unused commitments, while positive across all three samples, is much larger and more statistically significant for the largest banks. For banks with assets over $50 billion, a standard deviation increase in Unused commitments (\u00bc0.07; see Table 1 , panel B) leads to an increase in lending of 0.44% of assets (\u00bc0.07 x 0.0634). This increase equals about two-thirds of a standard deviation of the outcome during the crisis week (\u00bc0.72% of assets; see Table 1 , panel B).

To validate the regression as transparently as possible, Figure 4 scatters the 3-week change in C&I lending against unused commitments for the set of large banks (both scaled by assets). The figure shows a very tight link, with a slope that is slightly higher than that implied by the full regression (23.4% vs. 19%). Both of these estimates, in fact, are close to the ratio of total new C&I lending by large banks to their Q4 2019 unused commitments (\u00bc 22% \u00bc $400 billion / $1.82 trillion).",

Deposits increased by almost $1 trillion during the 3 weeks from March 11 to April 1. Part of this increase comes about mechanically, as each dollar drawn from a credit line ends up as an additional dollar of deposits in the banking system (though not necessarily at the bank providing the credit line). Additional deposits also flowed rapidly into banks, however, again at just the same time that liquidity demands spiked. According to the Investment Company Institute, during the last weeks of March 2020 investors pulled several hundreds of billions from bond and equity mutual funds as well as from prime money market funds. 18 Many of these funds flowed into banks, as investors sought a safe haven for their wealth in a classic \"flight to quality.\" Hence, liquidity poured into banks at exactly the right time, from both the public sector (increased bank reserves) and the private sector (increased deposits). 19",

Innovations, such as stress testing and additional capital buffers, required for the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) moved the largest banks well above minimum capital requirements (Schneider, Yang, and Strahan 2020) .

At the level of the individual lender, loan commitment drawdowns can be (1) internally funded by a mechanical increase in deposits that would occur if the borrower simply parked the drawn funds at her bank; (2) internally funded by running down the bank's buffer stock of cash; or (3) externally funded by coincident increases in deposits from new sources. Figure 6 illustrates the first two ways in which a bank might finance credit-line drawdowns (internally). The top portion of the figure represents cash hoarding by the borrower. In the example, the $100 drawn from an off-balance sheet loan commitment moves onto the bank's balance sheet and, simultaneously, $100 flows into the borrower's deposit account at the lending bank. The borrower has simply moved its liquidity from its undrawn credit line into its deposit account. This move is costly to the borrower (the net interest payments on the loan exceed the fees for undrawn funds), but doing so ensures the borrower/depositor against a future reduction in the creditline commitment. 20 The second way to finance the drawdown internally is illustrated in the lower panel of Figure 6 , where the $100 loan is funded out of the bank's stock of cash.",

Table 7 reports Equations (3a) and (3b) for banks separated by size bin. Panel A reports the results for deposits and panel B for cash. The results provide limited support for cash hoarding only at the smallest banks. In fact, the coefficient for undrawn commitments in the deposit equation (c D ) signs negatively for the largest banks. The large banks, as we have seen, experienced by far the greatest liquidity demands. For them, their business clientele draw funds from existing credit lines and use those funds to make payments, rather than holding them within the bank (as deposits). Consistent with this idea, panel B shows that for the large banks, higher levels of unused commitments came with greater declines in cash balances. The patterns for the smallest banks are consistent with cash hoarding by their borrowers: deposits grew faster for those with high levels of commitments while cash did not change. These very small banks, however, experienced much smaller increases in liquidity demands.",

Large banks experienced the lion's share of these liquidity demands. Unlike 2008, banks met the demand without running into binding financial constraints. We suggest two reasons for this. First, bank liquidity and bank capital buffers were both substantially more robust before the COVID-19 crisis than they were before the 2008 crisis.
