To test this, we exposed rats to single head-only exposure of a 4G long-term evolution (LTE)-1800 MHz electromagnetic field (EMF) for 2 h. We then assessed the impact on microglial space coverage and electrophysiological neuronal activity in the primary auditory cortex (ACx), under acute neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. The mean specific absorption rate in the ACx was 0.5 W/kg. Multiunit recording revealed that LTE-EMF triggered reduction in the response strength to pure tones and to natural vocalizations, together with an increase in acoustic threshold in the low and medium frequencies. Iba1 immunohistochemistry showed no change in the area covered by microglia cell bodies and processes. In healthy rats, the same LTE-exposure induced no change in response strength and acoustic threshold. Our data indicate that acute neuroinflammation sensitizes neuronal responses to LTE-EMF, which leads to an altered processing of acoustic stimuli in the ACx.",

            "text": "The electromagnetic environment of human populations has substantially evolved over the last three decades owing to the continuous expansion of wireless communications. Currently, more than two-thirds of the human population is considered as mobile phone (MP) users. The massive spreading of this technology has nourished concerns and debates about possible hazardous effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMF) in the radiofrequency (RF) range, which are emitted by MP or base stations and encode the communications. This public health issue has stimulated a wealth of experimental research dedicated to the effects of RF absorption in biological tissues 1 . Parts of these investigations have looked for alterations of neuronal network activities and cognitive processes, considering the proximity of the brain to the source of RF under common use of MP. Many of the reported studies pertains to the influence of pulse-modulated signals used in the second generation (2G) global system for mobile communication (GSM), or in the wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA)/3rd Generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication system (WCDMA/3G UMTS) 2-5 . Much less is known about the effects of RF signals used in the fourth generation (4G) mobile services, which rely on a fully digital Internet protocol-based technology called long term evolution (LTE) technology. The LTE mobile phone service was OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Neuroscience. The protocols were approved by the institutional ethic committee Paris-Sud and Centre (CEEA N\u00b059, project 2014-25, national agreement 03729.02) using the procedures 32-2011 and 34-2012 validated by this committee. We further attest that all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. This study was performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.",

In contrast with the GSM (2G) and WCDMA (3G) systems that are based on single-carrier modulation schemes, LTE uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the basic signal format 6 . Worldwide, LTE mobile services utilize a range of different frequency bands comprised between 450 and 3700 MHz including the 900 and 1800 MHz bands also used in the GSM. The capacity of RF exposure to impact on biological processes strongly depends on the specific absorption rate (SAR) expressed in W/kg, that measures the energy absorbed in the biological tissues. The effect of an acute 30 min head exposure to a 2.573 GHz LTE signal on the global neuronal networks activity was recently explored in healthy human volunteers. Using resting state functional resonance magnetic imaging, it was observed that the LTE exposure could induce alterations in spontaneous slow frequency fluctuations and in intraregional or interregional connectivities, whereas spatial peak SAR levels averaged over 10 g of tissue were estimated to vary from 0.42 to 1.52 W/kg, according to subjects [7] [8] [9] . Under similar exposure conditions (30 min duration, peak SAR level estimated at 1.34 W/kg using a representative human head model) electroencephalographic analyses indicated reduced spectral powers and interhemispheric coherences in the alpha and beta bands 10 . However, two other studies based on EEG analyses found that 20 or 30 min LTE head exposures with maximum local SAR levels set around 2 W/kg had either no detectable effect 11 or resulted in reduced spectral power in the alpha band, with no alterations in cognitive functions assessed with the Stroop test 12 . Significant discrepancies were also noted in the outcome of EEG or cognition studies dedicated to the effect of GSM or UMTS EMF exposures. They were thought to originate from variation in methodological designs and experimental parameters including signal types and modulations, exposure intensity and duration, or from heterogeneity among the human subjects with respect to age, anatomy or gender 2, 5, 13 .",

At the time of exposure, the LPS-triggered neuroinflammatory reaction was established in the cerebral cortex as indicated by upregulation of proinflammatory genes 26 and by the changes in the morphology of cortical microglia (Fig. 1) . The power of the LTE head-exposure was set in order to get a mean SAR level of 0.5 W/kg in the ACx (Fig. 2) . To determine whether LPS-activated microglia reacted to LTE EMF, we analyzed cortical sections stained with anti-Iba1 that selectively labels these cells 29 . As illustrated in Fig. 3a microglial cells looked very similar in sections of ACx fixed 3 to 4 h after sham or LTE exposure, showing the \"bushy like\" cell morphology elicited by the LPS proinflammatory treatment (Fig. 1) . Consistent with an absence of morphological response, quantitative image analyses showed no significant differences in the total area of Iba1 immunoreactivity (unpaired t-test, p = 0.308) or in the area (p = 0.196) and the density (p = 0.061) of Iba 1-stained cell bodies, when comparing LTE-exposed rats with Sham-exposed animals ( Fig. 3b- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ LTE exposure decreases neuronal responses in LPS-treated animals. Table 1 summarizes the number of animals and multi-unit recordings obtained in the primary auditory cortex for the four groups of rats (Sham, Exposed, Sham-LPS, Exposed-LPS). In the following results, we have included all recordings exhibiting significant spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs), that is tone-evoked responses at least six standard deviations above spontaneous firing rate (see Table 1 ). Applying this criterion, we selected 266 recordings for the Sham group, 273 recordings for the Exposed group, 299 recordings for the Sham-LPS group and 295 recordings for the Exposed-LPS group. In the following paragraphs, we will first describe the parameters extracted from the spectro-temporal receptive fields (i.e., the responses to pure tones) and from the responses to heterospecific vocalizations. Then, we will describe the quantifications of frequency response areas obtained for each group. To take into account the existence of \"nested data\" 30 in our experimental design, all the statistical analyses were performed based on the The cells were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody as described previously 26 . The LPS proinflammatory treatment resulted in changes in microglia cell morphologies including proximal thickening and increased short secondary branching of the cell processes leading to a \"bushy like\" appearance.

Figure 4a presents the distributions of best frequencies (BF, eliciting the largest responses at 75 dB SPL) for the cortical neurons obtained in the Sham and Exposed animals treated with LPS. The frequency range of the BFs extended from 1 to 36 kHz in both groups.

Spontaneous activity was not significantly decreased (i). (* p < 0.05, unpaired t-tests). (j,k) Effects of LTE exposure on the cortical thresholds. The average thresholds were significantly higher in LTE-exposed rats compared to Sham-exposed rats. This effect was more pronounced in the low and middle frequencies. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the responses to communication sounds were decreased both in terms of response strength and of trial-to-trial reliability (Fig. 4g ,h; unpaired t test, p = 0.043). Spontaneous activity was decreased but this effect was not significant ( Fig. 4i ; p = 0.0745). The response duration, the tuning bandwidth and the response latencies were not affected by LTE exposure in the LPS treated animals ( Fig. 4d-f ) suggesting that the frequency selectivity and the precision of onset responses were not impacted by LTE exposure in LPS-treated animals. We next assessed whether the pure-tone cortical thresholds were altered by the LTE-exposure. Based on the Frequency Response Areas (FRAs) obtained from each recordings, we determined the auditory threshold at each frequency and averaged these thresholds in the two groups of animals. Figure 4j shows the mean (\u00b1 sem) thresholds for the LPS treated rats from 1.1 to 36 kHz. Comparing the auditory thresholds of the Sham and Exposed groups revealed large increases in threshold in the Exposed animals compared to the Sham animals ( Fig. 4j) , an effect that was more prominent in the low and middle frequencies. More precisely, in low frequencies (< 2.25 kHz), the proportions of A1 neurons with high thresholds increased and the proportion of low and mid-thresholds neurons decreased (Chi-Square = 43.85; p < 0.0001; Fig. 4k , left panel). The same effect was also present in the middle frequencies (2.25 < Freq(kHz) < 11): there was higher proportion of cortical recordings with mid thresholds and a smaller proportion of neurons with low thresholds compared to the non-exposed group (Chi-Square = 71.17; p < 0.001; Fig. 4k , middle panel). There was also a significant difference in terms of threshold for the high frequency neurons (\u2265 11 kHz, p = 0.0059); the proportion of neurons with low threshold decreased and the proportion middle and high threshold increased (Chi-Square = 10.853; p = 0.04 Fig. 4k , right panel). LTE exposure alone did not change the response strength in healthy animals. Figure 5a presents the distributions of best frequencies (BF, eliciting the largest responses at 75 dB SPL) for the cortical neurons obtained in healthy animals for the Sham and Exposed group.

These changes in neuronal activity occurred without any clear alteration in the extent of the spatial domain covered by microglial cell processes.

Recordings of snail ganglia shortly after an exposure to 1800 MHz CW at a SAR level of 8.2 W/Kg, showed reduction in the threshold for firing action potential and neuronal accommodation 31 . On the other hand, spike and bursting activities in primary neuronal cultures derived from rat brain were reduced by exposures to GSM-1800 MHz or 1800 MHz CW applied for 15 min at a SAR of 4.6 W/kg. This suppressive effect was only partly reversible over a 30 min period after the end of the exposure. Full silencing of neurons was reached at a SAR of 9.2 W/kg. Dose-response analyses showed that GSM-1800 MHz was more efficient than 1800 MHz CW in suppressing burst activity indicating that neuronal responses depends on RF signal modulation 32 .",

One explanation could be that the LTE exposure potentially reduced the activity of some inhibitory interneurons, as it is documented that in the primary ACx, feedforward inhibitions control the duration of pyramidal cell responses triggered by excitatory thalamic inputs [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In contrast, in rats submitted to LPS-triggered neuroinflammation, there was no effect of LTE exposure on the duration of sound-evoked neuronal firing, but marked effects were detected on the strength of evoked responses. Indeed, compared to neuronal responses recorded in LPS sham-exposed rats, neurons of LPS-treated rats exposed to LTE displayed a decrease in response strength, an effect observed both at presentation of pure tones and natural vocalizations. The reduction in responses strength to pure tones occurred without narrowing the bandwidth of the spectral tuning at 75 dB, and as it occurred at all sound intensities, it induced an increase in acoustic threshold of cortical neurons in the low and middle frequencies.",

As for GSM signals, it is possible that head exposure to LTE-1800 MHz reduces neuronal excitability of ACx neurons in rats undergoing LPS-triggered neuroinflammation.

Their capacity to modulate neurotransmission relies not only on their production of compounds that potentialize, or limit, neurotransmission but also on the high motility of their cell processes. In the cerebral cortex, both enhancements and reductions in the activity of neuronal networks trigger rapid enlargement of microglia spatial domain due to the outgrowth of microglial cell processes 44, 45 .

This observation suggested that microglial reshaping triggered by GSM exposure could actively contribute to the GSM-induced reduction in sound-evoked neuronal responses. Our current study argues against this hypothesis in the context of a LTE-head exposure with a SAR ACx limited to 0.5 W/kg, as we found no increase in the spatial domain covered by microglial processes. However, this does not rule out any effect of LTE signals on LPS activated-microglia, which could in turn affect neuronal activity.

Our previous studies 26, 28 and the current one indicate that in the context of an acute inflammation, a head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz or LTE-1800 MHz can result in functional alterations of neuronal responses in ACx, as indicated by the increase in auditory threshold. For at least two main reasons, the cochlear function should be unaffected by our LTE exposure. First, as shown by the dosimetric study presented in Fig. 2 , the highest levels of SAR (close to 1 W/kg) were in the dorso-medial cortex (below the antenna) and they decreased largely when moving toward the more lateral and ventral portions of the head. It can be estimated to be around 0.1 W/kg at the level of the rat pinna (and lower in the ear canal). Second, when the ears of guinea pigs were exposed for 2 months to GSM 900 MHz (5 days/week, 1 h/day, SAR between 1 and 4 W/kg), there was no detectable change in the amplitude of distorsion-product otoacoustic emissions and in thresholds of auditory brainstem responses 47 . Also, in healthy rats, repeated head exposure to GSM 900 or 1800 MHz at a local SAR of 2 W/kg did not affect the function of cochlear outer hair cells 48 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ have shown that 10 to 30 min-exposures to EMF emitted by GSM mobile phones had no consistent effect on the auditory processing assessed at the cochlear [50] [51] [52] or brainstem level 53, 54 . In our study, the LTE-triggered alterations in neuronal firing were observed in vivo, from 3 to 6 h after the end of the exposure. In a previous study focused on the dorso-medial part of the cortex, several effects induced by a GSM-1800 MHz observed 24 h after exposure were no longer detected 72 h after exposure. This was the case for the extension of microglial cell processes, the downregulation of Interleukin-1\u00df gene and the post-translational modification of AMPA receptors 26 . Considering the lower SAR value estimated here in the auditory cortex (0.5W/kg) compared with that in the dorso-medial area (2.94 W/kg 26 ), it seems likely that the modifications in neuronal activity reported here were transient.",

The exposure system was analogous to the one described in previous studies 25 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ & Schwarz, Germany) was connected to a power amplifier (ZHL-4W-422+, Mini-Circuits, USA), a circulator (D3 1719-N, Sodhy, France), a bidirectional coupler (CD D 1824-2, \u2212 30 dB, Sodhy, France) and a fourways power divider (DC D 0922-4N, Sodhy, France), allowing simultaneous exposure of four animals. A power meter (N1921A, Agilent, USA) connected to the bidirectional coupler allowed continuous measurements and monitoring of incident and reflected powers within the setup. Each output was connected to a loop antenna (Sama-Sistemi srl; Roma) enabling local exposure of the animal's head. The loop antenna consisted of a printed circuit with two metallic lines engraved in a dielectric epoxy resin substrate (dielectric constant \u03b5 r = 4.6). At one end, this device consisted of a 1 mm wide line forming a loop placed close to the animals' head. As in previous studies 26, 62 , specific absorption rates (SARs) were determined numerically using a numerical rat model with the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method [63] [64] [65] . They were also determined experimentally in homogeneous rat model using a Luxtron probe for measurement of rises in temperature. In this case, SARs, expressed in W/kg, were calculated using the following equation: SAR = C \u0394T/\u0394t with C being the calorific capacity in J/ (kg K), \u0394T, the temperature change in \u00b0K and \u0394t, the time in seconds. Numerically determined SAR values were compared with experimental SAR values obtained using homogenous models, especially in the equivalent rat brain area. The difference between the numerical SAR determinations and the experimentally detected SAR values was less than 30%. Figure 2a shows the SAR distribution in the rat brain with a rat model, which matched that of the rats used in our study in terms of weight and size. The brain averaged SAR was 0.37 \u00b1 0.23 W/kg (mean \u00b1 std). SAR values were the highest in cortical areas located directly below the loop antenna. The local SAR in the ACx (SAR ACx ) was 0.50 \u00b1 0.08 W/kg (mean \u00b1 std) (Fig. 2b) . As the weight of the exposed rats was homogenous, differences in tissue thickness at the level of the head were negligible, so the actual SAR in ACx or other cortical regions was expected to be very similar from one exposed animal to another.",

A local anesthetic (Xylocain 2%) was injected subcutaneously in the skin above the skull and on the temporal muscles, and the animal was placed on a metal-free heating system. After placing the animal in a stereotaxic frame, a craniotomy was performed above the left temporal cortex. The opening was 9 mm wide starting at the intersection point between parietal and temporal bones and 5 mm height as in our previous studies 66 . The dura above the ACx was carefully removed under binocular control without damaging the blood vessels. At the end of the surgery, a pedestal in dental acrylic cement was built to allow atraumatic fixation of the animal's head during the recording session.

A silver wire (\u00f8: 300 \u00b5m), used as ground, was inserted between the temporal bone and the dura mater on the contralateral side. The estimated location of the primary ACx was 4-7 mm posterior to Bregma, 3 mm ventral to the superior suture of the temporal bone. The raw signal was amplified 10,000 times (TDT Medusa) then processed by a multichannel data acquisition system (RX5, TDT). The signal collected from each electrode was filtered (610-10,000 Hz) to extract multi-unit activity (MUA). The trigger level was carefully set for each electrode (by a co-author blind to the exposed or sham-exposed status) to select the largest action potentials from the signal. On-line and off-line examination of the waveforms indicates that the MUA collected here was made of action potentials generated by 3 to 6 neurons at the vicinity of the electrode. At the beginning of each experiment, we set the position of the electrode array in such a way that the two rows of eight electrodes can sample neurons responding from low to high frequency when progressing in the rostro-caudal direction.",

From the STRF obtained at 75 dB SPL, the Best Frequency (BF) was defined as the frequency (in kHz) where the highest firing rate was recorded. At each intensity, peaks of significant response were automatically identified using the following procedure: A positive peak in the MUA-based STRF was defined as a contour of firing rate above the average level of the baseline activity (estimated from the ten first milliseconds of STRFs at all intensity levels) plus six times the standard deviation of the baseline (spontaneous) activity.
