Furer et al. concluded 'Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNAbased COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster' [1] . The adverse event following mRNA vaccination is possible and emergence of 'zoster' skin lesion is sporadically reported. The exact pathomechanism is unclear. If it is an immunopathological problem, abnormal immunity should be identified. In addition, the case is mainly diagnosed based on clinical appearance without dermatopathological investigation. Given that zoster is a possible concurrent medical disorder in COVID-19 [2] , 'zoster' lesion might be only a co-incidence in anyone receiving mRNA vaccine. Clinically, zoster is not an uncommon problem in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases [3] . The epidemiological assessment cannot give a conclusion if there is no complete dermatopathological study."
