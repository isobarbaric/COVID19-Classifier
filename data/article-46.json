            "text": "Mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining exact matching frequent itemsets. Previous algorithms mine FT frequent itemsets using Apriori heuristic. Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms."

In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed for efficient mining of frequent itemsets ( Apiletti et al., 2017; Bodon, 2003; Burdick, Calimlim, Flannick, Gehrke, & Yiu, 2005; Gan, Lin, Fournier-Viger, Chao, & Zhan, 2017; Han, Pei, & Yin, 20 0 0; Kosters & Pijls, 2003; Liu, Lu, Yu, Wang, & Xiao, 2003; Pei, Tung, & Han, 2001; Uno, Kiyomi, & Arimura, 2004; Vo, Pham, Le, & Deng, 2017 ) . These algorithms take a transactional database and support threshold (minimum itemset support) as input and mines complete set of frequent itemsets with support greater than minimum itemset support . Traditional frequent itemset mining (FIM) approach dis-E-mail address: shariq.bashir@fui.edu.pk covers only exact matching itemsets that are absolutely matched. This creates problem when the database contains missing items in transactions and may cause some implicit frequent itemsets not being discover ( Yu, Li, & Wang, 2015 ) . In the presence of missing items users face difficulties in setting suitable support threshold for mining desired itemsets. For example, if the support threshold is set too large then FIM discovers only a small number of frequent itemsets, which do not provide desirable output. On the other hand if the support threshold is set too small then FIM generates too many redundant short length frequent itemsets ( Cheung & Fu, 2004; Huynh-Thi-Le, Le, Vo, & Le, 2015 ; Saif-Ur-Rehman, Ashraf, Habib, & Salam, 2016 ) . This not only consumes large processing time but also increases the complexity of filtering interesting frequent itemsets. In both settings, the ultimate goal of mining interesting frequent itemsets is undermined."

Table 1 shows a transactional database as our running example. It contains eleven items and nine transactions. To mine frequent itemsets if the user gives the minimum itemset support equals to 3 then there exists no itemset with length more than 2 items (see column 2 of Table 1 ). The database has many short length itemsets with low support count. To discover generalized knowledge users would be interested to mine itemsets of long length with high support count. If we further analyze the database, then we can discover some long length frequent itemsets. These are not absolutely matched in transactions but have support more than 2. For example, further analysis reveals that the itemset ( abcef ) has itemset support 3 as the transactions 10, 30, and 50 contain four out of five items of abcef , and every single item of ( abcef ) is appeared in two out of three transactions. This frequent itemset mining phenomenon is interesting in terms of that it discovers generalized frequent itemsets that are not absolutely matched by slightly relaxing the notion of traditional frequent itemset. This phenomenon motivates us to develop an automatic method to mine such kind of knowledge. This task is called mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets ( Pei et al., 2001 ) ."

FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divideand-conquer technique and recursively projects a transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database ( Han & Pei, 2014; Han et al., 20 0 0; Han, Pei, Yin, & Mao, 20 04 ) . The major advantage of mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach is that it removes two costly operations of Apriori heuristic: candidate generate-and-test and repeatedly scanning of database for counting support of itemsets. The first scan of database counts the support of all frequent items of length one. The second scan of database builds a compact data structure called frequent pattern (FP)-tree. Each node of FP-tree corresponds to an item which was found frequent in first scan of database. Next, all FT frequent itemsets are mined directly from this FP-tree without scanning the database multiple times. The approach traverses search space using depth first order and during traversing each node it generates FT frequent itemsets using conditional patterns and builds compacted child FP-trees for mining FT frequent itemsets of next level. We tested our approach on several benchmarks databases and found computationally efficient than FT-Apriori ."

Thus, the interesting subgraphs could be left undiscovered if their are slightly different occurrences of edges in databases. They proposed algorithm using Apriori heuristic to mine FT frequent subgraphs. They also enhanced the working of algorithm by mining non-redundant representative frequent subgraphs which further summarizes the frequent subgraphs by allowing approximate number of matches in a graph database.

They designed a classification framework in which frequent approximate subgraphs of images are utilised for classification features. They tested their approach on two real images databases and reported better classification accuracy than non mining approaches by keeping in view the fact that FT frequent subgraph mining is a better approach than exact mining approach for this particular task. Ashraf and d. Tabrez Nafis (2017) proposed FT frequent itemset mining algorithms for both certain and uncertain composite datasets. In experiments they showed their algorithms are efficient for mining such patterns. They also discovered whenever the frequent itemset mining is done on distributed computing environment, the problem of false positive and false negative can also be handled accordingly. Kargupta, Han, Yu, Motwani, and Kumar (2008) presented an approach for mining approximate frequent sequential patterns. Through experiments they showed their approach is efficient to mine globally repeating approximate sequential patterns which could not be discovered through existing exact matching techniques. Lee, Peng, and Lin (2009) developed algorithms for mining itemsets from biological databases by using FT frequent itemsets. They showed the number of tolerable faults occurred in a proportional FT itemsets are directly proportional to the length of the itemsets. They proposed two algorithms to solve this problem. First algorithm is based on Apriori heuristic which mines all FT itemsets with any number of faults occurred. The second algorithm divides complete set of FT itemsets in groups keeping in view a set ratio of tolerable faults which returns the mined itemsets from each group. They showed the working of their algorithms on real databases and reported epitopes of spike protein of SARS-CoV in resulting itemsets and reported FT frequent itesmets technique is better than exact matching techniques. Besson, Pensa, Robardet, and Boulicaut (2005) proposed a method to mine extensions of bi-set itemsets with fault tolerant factor. They also evaluated three declared specifications of FT bi-sets by considering constraints based mining methodology. As a result, their mining framework posted a better and comprehensive understanding on the requisite trade-off between pattern extraction feasibility, ease of interpretation, relevance and completeness of these fault tolerant patterns. They showed experimental demonstration empirically on real-life medical and synthetic databases."

            "text": "To avoid costly repeatedly scanning of database, Koh and Yo (2005) proposed an algorithm called VB-FT-Mine . VB-FT-Mine scans the database only once and constructs bit-vectors for each item. VB-FT-Mine then applies depth-first pattern generation approach to generate candidate itemsets. The bit-vectors of candidate itemsets are obtained systematically, and the VB-FT-Mine quickly counts the itemset support by applying bitwise operators on bit vectors. Although, bit-vectors increase the performance of VB-FT-Mine by quickly counting itemsets support, however, similar to FT-Apriori the VB-FT-Mine generates many non-existing candidate itemsets. Bashir, Halim, and Baig (2008) proposed an algorithm for mining FT frequent itemset using pattern growth approach. The main limitation of their algorithm is that it constructs more than one FP-trees for each itemset to mine its supersets. For example, to mine supersets of itemset X under FT factor \u03b4 = 2 . The algorithm constructs three FP-tress. The algorithm constructs first FP-tree for storing all transactions of database that have mismatch factor \u03b4 = 0 . The algorithm then constructs second FP-tree for storing all transactions that have mismatch factor \u03b4 = 1 . The algorithm then constructs third FP-tree for storing all transactions that have mismatch factor \u03b4 = 2 . Koh and Lang (2010) proposed an algorithm for mining FT-frequent itemset using pattern growth approach. Similar to Bashir et al. (2008) approach, the algorithm constructs multiple FP-trees for each itemset to mine its supersets. For example to mine supersets of itemset X = (ab) under FT factor \u03b4 = 2 , the algorithm constructs 2 | X | number of FP-trees. The algorithm constructs first FP-tree for storing all transactions that contain both items: a and b ( ab ). The algorithm constructs second FP-tree for storing all transactions that contain only item a (a b ) . The algorithm constructs third FP-tree for storing all transactions that contain only item b ( a b) . Finally, it constructs fourth FP-tree to store all transactions that do not contain both items: a and b ( ab ) ."

Due to constructing multiple FP-trees the transactions that share a similar prefix are split into multiple trees. Thus, these algorithms could not gain full benefit of FP-tree for counting itemset support. For large databases and with low support thresholds both algorithms consume large main memory for mining itemsets. The pattern growth presented in this paper does not create multiple FP-trees. If an itemset has multiple mismatch transactions, our approach maps all mismatch transactions into a single FP-tree. Thus for large databases and with low support thresholds our algorithm is more space efficient than related algorithms."

            "text": "To discover more interesting FT itemsets, Lee and Lin (2006) relaxed the definition of mining FT frequent itemsets by mining proportional FT frequent itemsets. The concept of mining proportional FT itemsets is similar to traditional FT itemsets, however, the fault tolerant factor in proportional FT itemsets is proportional to the length of itemset. Thus, the definition of proportional discovers much large number of itemsets than the FT itemset mining definition proposed in ( Pei et al., 2001 ) . Our proposed algorithm in based on the FT definition proposed in ( Pei et al., 2001 ) . Thus, the processing time of our proposed algorithm cannot be directly comparable with the algorithm proposed in ( Lee & Lin, 2006 ) . In ( Lee et al., 2009 ) , authors discussed the applications of proportional FT frequent itemsets in bioinformatics. To discover proportional FT frequent itemsets in a reasonable time Poon (2014, 2018) proposed efficient heuristic method to mine ap-proximation version of the itemsets. Their study showed heuristic algorithm is much faster than the exact algorithms while the error is acceptable. In all studies on mining proportional FT frequent itemsets the authors proposed algorithms by mining itemsets on the basis of Apriori-like candidate generation-and-test property. However, no effort is made how to use FP-tree structure and pattern growth for increasing the speed of counting itemset support and reducing the number of candidate itemsets. Our work is different to this research. Our proposed algorithm utilises FP-tree for quickly counting itemset support and reduces the number of candidate itemsets using pattern growth approach."

            "text": "we propose an approach for generating FT-FP-tree (fault tolerant FP-tree) and mining FT frequent itemsets from the FT-FP-tree. The FT-FP-tree is iteratively constructed for each FT frequent itemset of length (\u03b4 + 1) . Similar to FP-tree, FT-FP-tree of an itemset X is a compact data structure which maps all conditional patterns of X in the tree. This helps in avoiding costly candidate generation-andtest and scanning database multiple times for generating itemsets that are supersets of X . The FT-FP-Tree of X is constructed from the FT-conditional patterns of X . The FT-conditional patterns of X are generated from the conditional patterns of items in X . A conditional pattern is a FT-conditional pattern of mismatch factor f if has f number of items missing in the pattern. The value of f should be less or equals to \u03b4. If multiple FT-conditional patterns share similar set of items, then all are merged into a single FT-conditional pattern. A FT-conditional pattern of itemset ( X ) contains four segments. The first segment contains items that can generate itemsets contain X . The second segment contains support of FT-conditional pattern. The third segment contains number of missing items of X in FT-conditional pattern. The fourth segment contains item support of each item of X , which is useful for counting support of items. To map segments of FT-conditional patterns on FT-FP-Tree the algorithm creates FT-conditional pattern table ( FT-CP- Table ) at the end of each branch of FT-FP-Tree. The first segment of pattern is directly mapped on the nodes of FT-FP-Tree. The other segments of patterns are mapped on the FT-CP-Tree. Each FT-CP-Table contains three columns. The first column maps first segment ( \u03b4) of FT-conditional pattern. The second column maps second segment (support of pattern). The third column maps fourth column (items support) of FT-conditional pattern."

The FT-PatternGrowth is efficient because it generates candidate itemsets using pattern growth approach.

FT-Apriori creates linked list for each frequent item, and transactions are mapped in the linked lists of frequent items.

FT-PatternGrowth maps transactions in the FP-tree and large part of memory is consumed for creating nodes of tree and connecting parent and child nodes.

To deal with large number of transactions FT-Apriori has to generate many candidates itemsets, even those that do not exist in the database. We also found that large amount of processing time of FT-Apriori is spend on counting itemset support. This is because FT-Apriroi does not provide any functionality to compress the transactions which share a common set of items. This number of candidates itemsets becomes tremendous large when the database contains large number of frequent items. In contrast, the FT-PatternGrowth is efficient because it generates only those candidate itemsets which exist in the branches of FP-trees.

            "text": "Mining fault tolerant frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining traditional exact matching frequent itemsets. Previous algorithms on mining FT frequent itemsets are based on Apriori-like candidate generation-and-test approach. These algorithms generate many candidate itemsets including those that do not exist in the database and require multiple scans of database for counting the support of each candidate itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects a transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets in less processing time and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth also stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called FT-FP-tree. The support of candidate itemsets and the support of items are calculated directly from the FT-FP-tree without scanning the database multiple times. This reduces the processing time of algorithm for counting support of itemsets. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicate mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms."

Conditional patterns efc : 1 and eac : 1 are ignored as both are subsets of conditional patterns of item b with similar support, and both are already mapped on FT-FP-tree of itemset ( bca ). fdc : 1 is a FT-conditional pattern of FT factor \u03b4 = 2 because items b and a are missing from the pattern. The pattern fdc : 1 is converted into FTconditional pattern fd : 1 , sup : 1 , \u03b4: 2 , a : 0, c : 1, b : 0 .\u2022 Item a generates conditional patterns efa : 2 , ea : 1 and fda : 1 . The pattern efa : 2 is a subset of pattern efab : 1 of item b . Its support becomes 1 after subtracting its support from the support of pattern efab : 1 . The pattern ea : 1 is a subset of pattern eacb : 1 of item b . This pattern is ignored because its support becomes zero after subtracting its support from the support of pattern eacb : 1 . The pattern efa : 1 and pattern fda : 1 are FT-conditional patterns of FT factor \u03b4 = 2 because items c and b are missing from the patterns. The pattern efa : 1 is converted into FT-conditional pattern ef , sup : 1 , \u03b4: 2 , a : 1, c : 0, b : 0 . The pattern fda : 1 is converted into FT-conditional pattern fd , sup : 1 , \u03b4: 2 , a : 1, c : 0, b : 0 .",
