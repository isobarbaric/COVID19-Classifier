            "text": "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Wuhan, China, in 2019 led to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causing millions of deaths worldwide. The World Health Organization has reported nearly 178 million confirmed cases and 3,864,180 deaths globally as of June 21 st , 2021 (WHO, 2021) . Despite the implementation of effective vaccines to control COVID-19, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, particularly in the spike (S) protein, led to emergence of variants against which the current vaccines may be partially effective. is the third outbreak of coronavirus (CoV) associated disease in the past 100 years; the first two epidemics were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively. These CoVs are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) and infect both animals (bats, snakes, pangolin, etc.) and humans (Jones et al., 2008 , Karesh et al., 2012 , Cleaveland et al., 2001 . SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals (Guan et al., 2003) while MERS was transmitted from dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016) with bats being the primary reservoir for both viruses (Cui et al., 2019 , Perlman, 2020 . The continued evolution and genetic diversity in variants of SARS-CoV have increased the possibility of crossing the species barrier and transmission of disease to humans (Li et al., 2005b) . However, the steps involved in the natural selection and adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to its human host from animals remains unclear. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV 2 across diverse host species may help determine their diversity and transmissibility of COVID-19."

Previously, potential roles of the PCPs in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including molecular weight, thermal stability, pH, and other properties have been examined to develop quality control measures for vaccines (Scheller et al., 2020) . Hasan et al. compared the PCPs of protein ORF8 from SARS-CoV-2, pangolin-CoV, and bat-RaTG13-CoV, and reported that some PCPs of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 showed higher correlation with bat-RaTG13-CoV and less correlation with pangolin-CoV (Hassan et al., 2021) . We have previously reported some informative PCPs, including normalized Van der Waals volume, delta G values, normalized frequencies of turn in \u03b1/\u03b2 class, normalized positional residues frequency at helix termini N\", and relative mutability, which were potential predictors for differentiating human and nonhuman host CoVs (Yerukala Sathipati and Ho, 2021) . These changes in the properties of S protein is of particular value for the development and refinement of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics-based approaches to analyze and predict the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, identify alterations in treatment response, and highlight areas of concern for increased transmissibility (Cave et al., 2021 , Arora et al., 2020 , Auwul et al., 2021 , Brierley and Fowler, 2021 ."

SPIKES was developed based on support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish S proteins of CoVs across human and diverse animal species and uses an optimal feature selection algorithm, inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm (IBCGA) (Ho et al., 2004) , to select informative properties from four major protein features including amino acid composition (AAC), dipeptide composition J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (DPC), pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), and PCPs. SPIKES was developed using information retrieved from the large-scale S protein sequences of human and animal host CoVs from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. The predictive ability of SPIKES was compared with those of seven machine learning algorithms, and the results showed its excellent discriminative ability. Identified PCPs, amino acid, and dipeptide compositions were further analyzed to identify the critical changes occurred in the S protein. Information obtained from SPIKES may be applicable for guiding the refinement of vaccine and therapeutic targets against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Table 1 ."

This measurement was based on an analysis of the conformational properties of amino acids in the alpha helix of 25 proteins using the information theory approach. The information measures for the alpha helical conformations shows that Glu and Ala are the strongest helix formers when compared to other amino acids. We calculated the conformational measurement for the alpha helices of S proteins using the property values of ROBB760101. Larger differences in the amino acids, Ala, Gly, Pro, Glu, and Leu, were observed for the alpha helix conformational preferences of S proteins whereas no difference was observed for Val, His, Trp, and Asp between human and animal host CoVs. Previous research has shown that alpha helices are critical for SARS-CoV infection (Millet and Whittaker, 2018) . In SARS-CoV, fusion domains are enriched in alpha helices and heptad repeats containing some hydrophobic residues involved in the membrane fusion process (Millet and Whittaker, 2018) . The domain structure of S proteins are similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; however, the contact amino acid sites between SARS-CoV and human J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ACE-2 are different from those between SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE-2 (Walls et al., 2016 , Walls et al., 2020 . We performed protein sequence alignment of two helix fusion cores of S proteins, 6LXT (SARS-CoV-2) and 1WYY (SARS-CoV), using the SIM alignment tool (Huang and Miller, 1991) , Expasy. The alignment analysis showed that both sequences shared 85.6% sequence similarity with an SIM alignment score of 536. The smaller changes in the amino acid core could affect the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to its host receptor. The helix cores of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are shown in Figure 3 ."

To track the amino acid changes and properties of S proteins across diverse animal hosts, we proposed a prediction method called SPIKES.

SPIKES accurately distinguished S proteins of diverse species and identified some informative PCPs, AAC, DPC and PseAAC which possess diverse roles in SARS-CoVs. A comparison of the predictive performance of our method highlighted enhanced predictive ability of SPIKES to some wellknown machine learning classifiers."

Amino acid compositional changes were also observed for the remaining top ranked PCPs, including QIAN880137, PRAM820103, NAKH920103, OOBM850101, CHAM830104, and ROBB760103, between the S proteins of human and animal CoVs. We also reported nine additional PCPs based on feature frequency scores. In our previous J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f work (Yerukala Sathipati and Ho, 2021) , we attempted to discover the properties of CoV proteins and identified some PCPs of interest based on differences in Van der Waals volume (FAUJ880103), helix and beta turns properties (ONEK900101, PALJ810116, AURR980102, and MONM990101), and relative mutability (DAYM780201) that distinguish the human host from animal host species CoVs. In this study, we exclusively focused on S proteins. Our analyses showed that secondary structure properties and relative mutability were important PCPs that have the potential to determine and alter the species specificity of CoVs. The helix bundle in SARS-CoVs appears to play an essential role in protein fusion and virus entry. In the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) form a helix bundle that is essential for S protein fusion and entry into the host cell. A sequence alignment study by Xia and colleagues showed that the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S2 are highly conserved with more than 90% identity while the HR1 core region showed nearly 38% difference due to mutations . PCP analysis of ROBB760101 revealed that a larger difference in the amino acids, Ala, Gly, Pro, Glu, and Leu, for the alpha helix conformational preferences of S proteins between human and animal CoVs. These amino acid differences may increase the affinity of S proteins to the ACE 2 receptor in SARS-CoV-2."

Results from Li and colleagues indicate that hydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than those in SARS-CoV , which supports our findings. We also observed significant differences in amino acids, Ala, Leu, Phe, Gly, Pro, Glu, Ile, and Gln, for the relative mutability of S proteins between J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f human and animal host CoVs. Based on our analysis and previous evidences, these identified PCPs and amino acid compositional differences might affect the viral fusion in human host CoVs when compared to the animal host CoVs.

Applications of AI and machine learning techniques may help predict amino acid changes that could lead to the emergence of more infective and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. We developed a machine learning method SPIKES that identified changes at the amino acid and secondary structure levels that could determine the species specificity of S protein. Knowledge on PCPs will aid in developing appropriate quality control measures for vaccine designs (Scheller et al., 2020) . The amino acid substitutions in S protein that interacts with ACE-2 receptor may play a key role in viral fusion and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Due to its crucial role in viral infection, S protein has therefore been selected as a potential target for S protein-based target therapies and vaccine development (Harvey et al., 2021) . Hence, exploration of PCPs and amino acid changes in S proteins could be beneficial to understand the immune response and neutralize the antigenicity in SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, this study aims to track the amino acid changes in S proteins from animal to humans that could facilitate the PCPs and amino acid compositional differences which may have affected the viral fusion process.

Since the amino acid change is a crucial factor for disease transmission but to reduce the ambiguity, we considered 99% sequence identity in the redundancy reduction process. After sequence redundancy reduction and accounting for uncertainties, the final dataset, called All-Spike, consisted of 211 and 611 S protein sequences of spike-H and spike-A, respectively. A balanced dataset, called Balanced-Spike, consisted of the 211 sequences of spike-H and 211 sequences of spike-A, which were randomly chosen. To evaluate the predictive performance of SPIKES on an independent test, the Balanced-Spike was divided into a training (Spike-training) and test (Spike-test) in a 7:3 ratios."

IBCGA uses an intelligent evolutionary algorithm (IEA) to select a small set of informative features while optimizing predictive performance. In IBCGA, the genetic algorithm (GA) terms such as 'gene' and 'chromosome' were placed with 'GA-gene' and 'GAchromosome' for distinction. The GA-chromosome consists of binary GA-genes for selecting m informative features of PCPs, dipeptides, AAC, and PseAAC, and two 4-bit GA-genes for encoding the parameters C and \u03b3 of SVM. IBCGA can simultaneously obtain a set of solutions, Xr, where r=rend, rend + 1,\u2026, rstart in a single run. In SPIKES, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used for the implementation of SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) . The scoring function of the RBF kernel is computed in the feature space between the two data points, xi and yj. The RBF kernel function is defined as follows:"
