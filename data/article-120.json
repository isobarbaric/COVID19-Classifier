As the number of cases increases every day, with the increase in the number of vaccinated people all over the world, this complication is a concern to the medical field. We report a case on the acute management of a patient who presented to us with life-threatening bilateral pulmonary embolism as a complication of VITT after the first dose of vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19."

            "text": "COVID-19, an infection caused by a newly detected coronavirus, was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in 2019. This virus infects the respiratory tract and may cause life-threatening viral pneumonia with a wide range of complications that may lead to death. The viral infection has expanded to be a pandemic disease with more than 250 million infected cases and about 5 million deaths worldwide. 1 An emergency use authorisation for different vaccines was adopted to compete against this life-threatening challenge and to stop the pandemic. Unfortunately, a relatively rare, yet very dangerous and potentially fatal complication, called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) was discovered after vaccination with viral vector vaccines. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] VITT is thought to be an antibody-mediated reaction in which immunoglobulins recognise a protein factor on the surface of platelets called platelet factor 4 (PF4). This causes platelet activation with subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade and platelet overconsumption, resulting in clinically significant thromboembolism with a potential risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. 7 8 Although thrombosis in VITT may occur in the usual typical sites of venous thromboembolism such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb or pulmonary embolism (PE), it occurs also, without any obvious explanation, in many unusual sites, such as the splanchnic (splenic, portal, mesenteric) veins, adrenal veins (risk for adrenal failure), and the cerebral and ophthalmic veins. Arterial thrombosis including ischaemic stroke (often middle cerebral artery) and peripheral arterial occlusion was also described."

A very low platelet count of 5\u00d710 3 /\u00b5L and D-dimer of 66 \u03bcg/mL at the time of presentation. 3. Radiological evidence of thrombosis (bilateral pulmonary embolism, DVT). 4. A strong positive anti-PF4 ELISA test, despite an absent history of treatment with heparin containing medication, confirmed with a negative SRA and HIPA test. In this case, there was a high risk of bleeding due to the severe thrombocytopenia. At the same time, the patient had a severe life-threatening bilateral pulmonary embolism which required urgent treatment."

Since the pathophysiology of VITT largely resembles HIT (heparininduced thrombocytopenia), also an immune-mediated condition resulting from the formation of antibodies against PF4, it is not recommended to use any heparin-based anticoagulants. Other options included a DOAC, such as factor XA inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban or rivaroxaban), or the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Alternatively, fondaparinux or danaparoid, or even a parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban or bivalirudin), could be considered."

After treatment with IVIG, the platelet count markedly improved by the third day. Follow-up platelet count measurements were regularly obtained, since the platelet count could decline again with waning of the IVIG effect, requiring additional IVIG therapy. 11 The post-infarction pneumonia was successfully managed with piperacillin/tazobactam."
