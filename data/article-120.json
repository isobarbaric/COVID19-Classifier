As the number of cases increases every day, with the increase in the number of vaccinated people all over the world, this complication is a concern to the medical field. We report a case on the acute management of a patient who presented to us with life-threatening bilateral pulmonary embolism as a complication of VITT after the first dose of vaccination with Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19.",

            "text": "COVID-19, an infection caused by a newly detected coronavirus, was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in 2019. This virus infects the respiratory tract and may cause life-threatening viral pneumonia with a wide range of complications that may lead to death. The viral infection has expanded to be a pandemic disease with more than 250 million infected cases and about 5 million deaths worldwide. 1 An emergency use authorisation for different vaccines was adopted to compete against this life-threatening challenge and to stop the pandemic. Unfortunately, a relatively rare, yet very dangerous and potentially fatal complication, called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) was discovered after vaccination with viral vector vaccines. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] VITT is thought to be an antibody-mediated reaction in which immunoglobulins recognise a protein factor on the surface of platelets called platelet factor 4 (PF4). This causes platelet activation with subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade and platelet overconsumption, resulting in clinically significant thromboembolism with a potential risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. 7 8 Although thrombosis in VITT may occur in the usual typical sites of venous thromboembolism such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb or pulmonary embolism (PE), it occurs also, without any obvious explanation, in many unusual sites, such as the splanchnic (splenic, portal, mesenteric) veins, adrenal veins (risk for adrenal failure), and the cerebral and ophthalmic veins. Arterial thrombosis including ischaemic stroke (often middle cerebral artery) and peripheral arterial occlusion was also described.",
