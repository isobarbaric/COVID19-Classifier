Our study exemplifies the importance of delivering optimal care to mitigate risk ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global anguish unparalleled in recent times. As cases rise, increased pressure on health services, combined with severe disruption to people's everyday lives, can adversely affect individuals living with chronic illnesses, including people with epilepsy. Stressors related to disruption to healthcare, finances, mental well-being, relationships, schooling, physical activity, and increased isolation could increase seizures and impair epilepsy selfmanagement.",

The indirect consequences of the pandemic could, however, impair their health and well-being in numerous ways (2) . Stressors, including economic challenges, anxiety, isolation, decreased physical activity, as well as interruptions to schooling, work, and family life, may increase seizures (6, 7) . Disruption to self-management practices, such as adherence to anti-seizure medications (ASMs), and a lack of access to healthcare may also play a role (8) (9) (10) . Together, these factors could increase seizures, worsen associated psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, and contribute to an increased risk of premature mortality (11) .",

We aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on people's health and well-being. Specifically, we evaluated whether people's exposure to risk had changed, including an increased risk of seizures, worsening morbidity, and their corresponding risk of premature mortality. While the surveys achieved a global reach in multiple languages, here we present the UK data. These data are derived from people with epilepsy and their caregivers, submitted during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic when the high rate of new COVID-19 infections had a considerable impact on epilepsy services (3, 24) . We explore various themes associated with COVID-19 and epilepsy, including respondents' demographics, health status, and their interactions with health services. We also assessed knowledge and exposure to risk, including factors associated with premature mortality in people with epilepsy (20) (21) (22) (23) .",

Six caregivers reported that changes to schooling and lifestyle contributed to declining mental and physical health in the person for whom they care. Notably, two caregivers reported improved health outcomes as the individual with epilepsy had fewer infections and benefited from spending more time at home. Twenty-five pieces of anecdotal data from the individual survey identified factors contributing to their declining health (table 2).

These groups are already predisposed to higher levels of comorbidities and experience more years of life lost to disability (11, (43) (44) . This can hinder an individual's stability and financial resilience, contributing to a decrease in earning potential and employment opportunities when unwell (11, (42) (43) (44) (45) . As services reconstitute, clinicians must engage in comprehensive communication to ascertain the specific needs of individuals, alongside an appraisal of their physical health, psychosocial well-being, and the interrelation between these components. To achieve this, a multimodal approach that includes social and economic interventions is essential.",

We cannot quantify health changes due to the absence of baseline data before the pandemic and the possibility of recall bias (56) . Certain questions also will need refining in future iterations as, for example, people could report a change in their seizures without necessarily specifying in which direction (worsening or improvement) that change was.

Respondents were able to answer stating that they had difficulty with more than one aspect of health care and so raw numbers of respondents are presented. Respondents were asked whether they had, where relevant, discussed specific aspects relating to epilepsy with a clinician in the past twelve months. Many of these data will relate to prior to the pandemic demonstrating that discussion about co-morbidity, sleep, SUDEP and other elements relating to the holistic care of people with epilepsy are not well discussed even outside of the changes to healthcare that COVID-19 has imposed.
