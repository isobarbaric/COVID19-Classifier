            "text": "During COVID-19 pandemic, mutations of SARS-CoV-2 produce new strains that can be more virulent and evade vaccines. Viral RNA mutations can arise from misincorporation by RNA-polymerases and modification by host factors. Recent SARS-CoV-2 sequence analyses showed a strong bias toward C-to-U mutation, suggesting that host APOBEC cytosine deaminases with immune functions may cause the mutation. We report the experimental evidence demonstrating that APOBEC3A and APOBEC1 can efficiently edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA to produce C-to-U mutation at specific sites. However, APOBEC-editing does not inhibit the viral RNA accumulation in cells. Instead, APOBEC3A-editing of SARS-CoV-2 promotes viral replication/propagation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the APOBEC-mediated mutations for fitness and evolution. Unlike the unpredictability of random mutations, this study has significant implications in predicting the potential mutations based on the UC/AC motifs and surrounding RNA structures, thus offering a basis for guiding future antiviral therapies and vaccines against the escape mutants."

The ROS could oxidize nucleic acids to cause viral mutations, which is proposed to be related to the G-to-U and C-to-A mutations (3, 14) . The ADAR enzymes modify adenosine to inosine to cause A-to-G mutations in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which play important roles in immune regulation ((15, 16) and references therein)."

The seven APOBEC3 subfamilies (including A3A to A3H) are reported to have restriction activities to DNA and RNA viruses (reviewed in (19, 20)). While most APOBECs use single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as substrate for Cdeamination (reviewed in (17)), three APOBECs, APOBEC1 (A1) (21, 22), APOBEC3A (A3A) (23), and APOBEC3G (A3G) (24), are also shown to deaminate certain cellular single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets to cause C-to-U editing. Interestingly, the database analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations showed an overwhelmingly high C-to-U mutation rate, account for about 40% of all single nucleotide variations, which was interpreted as a result of RNA editing by APOBECs rather than random mutations (9, 10, 12, 25) ."

We adapted a cell-based RNA editing system as described in (26) to examine the ability of APOBEC proteins to edit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to cause C-to-U mutations. Because A1+A1CF, A3A, and A3G are the three APOBEC proteins shown to possess RNA editing activities (22-24), we tested each of these three APOBEC proteins for their ability to edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Due to technical and budget limitations for the next generation deep-sequencing (NGS), we selected seven 200 nt-long RNA segments across the SARS-."

These seven segments are distributed from the 5' to 3' end of the genome to include various viral genes, including the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR). The selected 200 nt viral RNA segments were constructed into DNA reporter vector fused to the C-terminus of eGFP coding sequence that can be transcribed into RNA under a constitutive promoter (Fig. 1B) . An AAV intron is inserted in the middle of eGFP that can be useful to differentiate the mature mRNA transcript (with the intron spliced out) from the coding DNA containing the intron. A primer annealing to the exon-exon junction on the mature mRNA (JUNC, Fig. 1B) can specifically amplify the RNA, but not the coding DNA, by PCR, making it possible to rule out the C-to-U deamination on DNA from the direct C-to-U RNA editing by APOBECs. The reporter vector was co-transfected with the APOBEC editor vector to express the selected APOBEC protein in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C) . Total RNAs were extracted from the cells for cDNA preparation for sequencing using the Safe-Sequencing-System (SSS) as described below."

First, the AccuScript highfidelity reverse transcriptase (known to have ~10 #$ -10 #% error rates) was used for the initial reverse transcription of the target SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts from the cells to single-stranded cDNA. The JUNC forward primer is used to ensure only mature spliced mRNA segments of SARS-CoV-2 were amplified (Fig.   1B) . Second, 2 cycles of initial PCR amplification of the cDNA were performed with a both forward and reverse primers containing a Unique IDentifier (UID), a string of 15 nt randomized sequences, to attach the large family of different UID barcodes (~4 '( ), discerning each original target molecule. Third, the initial 2 cycle-PCR products were purified and then amplified with Illumina adaptors (PCR error rate is ~10 #) )."

The C-to-U editing by all three APOBECs is detected, with A1+A1CF and A3A showing much higher editing than A3G (Fig S1) . The C-to-U editing levels by each APOBEC are normalized by the control group (Table S2) . Here, we define the significant target C site where the C-to-U editing efficiency is at least 3 times higher than control. Out of 307 total C in the selected viral RNA segments, the number of significant target sites with A1+A1CF is 135, A3A is 67, and A3G is 11 ( Fig. 2A and Table S2 ). Analysis of the sequence contexts around the significant target C sites (with \u00b1 5 nucleotides from target C) showed that A3A prefers for an UCa/u trinucleotide motif and A1+A1CF prefers ACu/a motif ( Fig. 2A) , which is consistent with the reported motif preference for RNA editing by A3A and A1 (23, 29)."

It distinctly shows that A3A strongly prefers the UC motif, whereas A1+A1CF has a strong bias toward the AC motif, and A3G prefers CC motifs on the viral RNA.

However, this requirement for the mooring sequence and stem-loop structures are shown to be quite relaxed and still needs further characterization (26, 33) . We analyzed the RNA features around the top 3 AC sites with the highest editing efficiency by A1+A1CF (Fig. 3A) . The result showed that they could form a relatively stable stem-loop structure, with relatively high U/G/A contents downstream of the target C (Fig. 3A) .

The reporter DNA and the RNA transcript extracted from the cells expressing APOBECs were PCR amplified using the forward prime annealing to the AAV-intron specific for the DNA or to the JUNC specific for the spliced RNA only. The PCR products from the DNA and mRNA were subjected to Sanger sequencing, and the C-to-U changes were analyzed. No DNA C-to-U mutation was detected, but specific RNA C-to-U changes on the mRNA transcript were present in a frequency consistent with our SSS results obtained in the presence of A1+A1CF (e.g., C16049, C16054, and C16092, etc.) or A3A (C16063) (Fig S3) .

Surprisingly, the C-to-U variant at UC241 occurred in early January 2020 and has rapidly become a signature of the dominant strain that spread worldwide ( Fig. 4C and Fig S4C) , strongly suggesting that this C-to-U mutation at UC241 generated by A3A editing may contribute to the better fitness for SARS-CoV-2. Although C241 to U mutation is within 5'UTR, the correlation of this mutation with the dominant new strains is reminiscent of that of the D614G mutation of the spike protein-coding region (5, 36). However, because 5'UTR has an important regulatory function for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs and for the expression of viral proteins (37, 38), the UC241 mutation may affect one or several aspects of these important functions of the 5'UTR in the viral infection steps."

The externally inserted APOBECs are under tetracyclinecontrolled promoter so that their expression can be induced by doxycycline (Fig. 5A, Fig S5) . The Caco-2-APOBEC stable cell lines were then infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the viral RNA replication and progeny yield were measured and compared with the control cell line without APOBEC expression. The viral RNA abundance as an indicator for RNA replication was measured using real-time quantitative PCR to detect the RNA levels using primers specific for amplifying three viral regions: the Nsp12 region, the S region, and the N region. The viral progeny yield was assayed through plaque assay using the virions produced from the Caco-2-APOBEC stable cell lines at different time points post-infection (Fig. 5A) ."

Even though no apparent differences in SARS-CoV-2 replication and progeny production were observed in the control and the A1+A1CF or A3G-expressing stable cell lines, significant increases of the viral RNA replication and the viral yield were observed in the A3A-expressing cell line (Fig. 5B and 5C) . These results contrast to the known antiviral effect of APOBECs (17) (18) (19) (20) . Currently, it is unclear exactly how the A3Aoverexpression can promote the replication and progeny production of SARS-CoV-2. One plausible explanation is that, while most APOBEC-mediated C-to-U mutations may be detrimental to the virus and are lost in the viral infection cycle, some mutations beneficial to the virus's fitness will be selected for in the new viral strains. If so, SARS-CoV-2 can then turn the tables on the APOBEC mutational defense system for its evolution, including (but not limited to) the improvement of viral RNA replication, protein expression, evasion of host immune responses, and receptor binding and cell entry."

Among many of the detected A3A edited sites on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our study are three C-to-U mutations located in the 5'UTR region, UC203, UC222, UC241 (Fig. 4A, B) . The SARS-CoV-2 from patients detected all of these three mutations at different stages since early 2020, but only major circulating viral strains since early 2020 acquired the mutation at UC241 (Fig. 4C, Fig S4C) , suggesting that C-to-U mutation at UC241 is selected for better viral fitness. This observation is surprising considering UC241 is in the non-coding 5'UTR region and, thus, not affecting the ORF coding of a protein, as in the case of the previously reported D614G mutation of the spike protein for viral fitness (5, 36) . Therefore, this C241 to U mutation should not be related to a change of a viral protein function, such as cell surface receptor binding or polyprotein processing. Mutations outside protein-coding ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 were previously designated as nonfunctional changes (3). However, the 5'UTR region of SARS-CoV-2 has important function in regulating protein expression and viral RNA replication and virion packaging (37, 38, 52) . Thus, this UC241 mutation in the 5'UTR region may impact the viral RNA stability, replication, packaging, or the translation efficiency of the downstream proteins to endow the virus with better fitness."

The C203, C222, and C241 represent many of the C-to-U mutational events (asterisks) with the UC motif in the SARS-CoV-2 variants. (B) A3A-mediated C-to-U editing results on the 5'UTR-Orf1a (142-341nt) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from our cell-based editing system and the SSS analysis. The Ctrl (EV) editing levels (or background error rates) of the corresponding region are presented as negative values (%). Four different dinucleotide motifs are indicated, with UC in red, GC in orange, AC in green, and CC in blue. The C203, C222, and C241 (asterisks) all showed significant editing by A3A. (C) The C-to-U mutation prevalence over time at C203, C222, and C241. The sequencing frequency is represented by C in blue and U in yellow (referred to the Nextstrain datasets: https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global). This analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 started to acquire the Cto-U mutation at C241 in January 2020. By July 2020, 90% of the circulating viral variants carry this mutation at C241. By March 2021, almost all circulating viral variants have this mutation, suggesting the C241 to U mutation in the 5'UTR is beneficial to the viral fitness."

The details of our implementation of the method was described in (28) . We wrote Python scripts to analyze the sequencing data. We only considered those sequencing reads such that (1) at least 85% of the bases matched the reference sequence, and (2) the quality scores for all the UID bases were 30 or greater (probability of a sequencing error < 0.001). We clustered reads with the same UID and barcode into UID families. We only considered those families with at least three reads with the same UID and barcode. At each nucleotide site, the mutation frequency is calculated by dividing a numerator by a denominator. The denominator is the number of UID families that, at this particular nucleotide site, have at least three reads with quality scores of at least 20 (probability of a sequencing error < 0.01; because of this quality restriction, the denominator may be different at different sites). The numerator is the number of UID families that, at this particular site, (1) have at least three reads with quality scores of at least 20, and (2) 95% of these reads have the same base, which is different than the reference. The probability that three out of three reads will all have the same sequencing error at a site is then 10 -7 (=(0.01 3 )/(3 2 ))."

Unlike the unpredictability of the random mutations caused by RNA replication or ROS, this study has significant implications in predicting potential locations of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on the UC/AC motifs and the surrounding RNA structures. Such prediction of possible mutations in the coding and non-coding regions is especially meaningful with the new selection pressure from vaccines and antiviral drugs. The risk of novel immune escape or drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains increases with the continued large-scale circulation of the delta and other variants among unvaccinated and vaccinated people.
