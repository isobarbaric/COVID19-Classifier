They have synergistic action on epithelial cells to stimulate their production of antimicrobial peptides which are protective against infections. However, both interleukins may contribute to ARDS pathology if their production is not controlled. This study aimed to investigate serum levels of IL-17A and IL-22 in relation to the disease outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Serum IL-17A and IL-22 were measured by ELISA in 40 patients with SARS-CoV-2, aged between 2 months and 16 years, (18 had COVID-19 and 22 had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children \"MIS-C\") in comparison to 48 age-and sex-matched healthy control children. Patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C had significantly higher serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels than healthy control children (P<0.001). Increased serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels were found in all patients. Elevated CRP and serum ferritin levels were found in 90% of these patients."

There were non-significant differences between patients who recovered and those who died or had a residual illness in evels of IL-17A, IL-22 and routine inflammatory markers of COVID-19. In conclusions, serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels were up-regulated in all patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Levels of serum IL-17A, IL-22 and the routine inflammatory markers of COVID-19 were not correlated with the disease outcome. Our conclusions are limited by the sample size."

However, uncontrolled and excessive production of IL-17A is one of the potential mechanisms underlying autoimmunity, chronic inflammatory conditions and neoplasms [6, 7] . Although the mediated responses of IL-17A play a role in the killing of the pathogens via neutrophil recruitment, this may occur at the expense of the tissue damage. This \"double-edged sword\" paradigm has been involved in the lung injury caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and H1N1 influenza infection [8, 9] . IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family. It mediates its effects via the IL-22 receptor complex which is expressed by non-hematopoietic cell lineages of lung, skin, intestine, liver, pancreas and kidney [10] . IL-22 has a dual role either protective or pathogenic functions during inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune diseases [11] ."

However, uncontrolled and excessive production of IL-17A is one of the mechanisms that have a key role in inflammatory conditions [6] . Infection is a complex series of interaction between the human host, the microbe and the environment. Host genomic variability has been linked to complications associated with infections. In COVID-19 pandemic, the identification of the host genomic factors that increase the resistance or the susceptibility to COVID-19 and translation of these findings to improve the patient care should be the goal [31] . Thus, genetic factors may determine the outcome of the disease rather than the level of the inflammatory markers. This may explain the lack of association between the studied inflammatory markers and the outcome of COVID-19 infection in this study."
