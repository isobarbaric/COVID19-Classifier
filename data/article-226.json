            "text": "Both IL-17A and IL-22 share cellular sources and signalling pathways. They have synergistic action on epithelial cells to stimulate their production of antimicrobial peptides which are protective against infections. However, both interleukins may contribute to ARDS pathology if their production is not controlled. This study aimed to investigate serum levels of IL-17A and IL-22 in relation to the disease outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Serum IL-17A and IL-22 were measured by ELISA in 40 patients with SARS-CoV-2, aged between 2 months and 16 years, (18 had COVID-19 and 22 had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children \"MIS-C\") in comparison to 48 age-and sex-matched healthy control children. Patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C had significantly higher serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels than healthy control children (P<0.001). Increased serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels were found in all patients. Elevated CRP and serum ferritin levels were found in 90% of these patients."

There were non-significant differences between patients who recovered and those who died or had a residual illness in evels of IL-17A, IL-22 and routine inflammatory markers of COVID-19. In conclusions, serum IL-17A and IL-22 levels were up-regulated in all patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Levels of serum IL-17A, IL-22 and the routine inflammatory markers of COVID-19 were not correlated with the disease outcome. Our conclusions are limited by the sample size."

However, uncontrolled and excessive production of IL-17A is one of the potential mechanisms underlying autoimmunity, chronic inflammatory conditions and neoplasms [6, 7] . Although the mediated responses of IL-17A play a role in the killing of the pathogens via neutrophil recruitment, this may occur at the expense of the tissue damage. This \"double-edged sword\" paradigm has been involved in the lung injury caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and H1N1 influenza infection [8, 9] . IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family. It mediates its effects via the IL-22 receptor complex which is expressed by non-hematopoietic cell lineages of lung, skin, intestine, liver, pancreas and kidney [10] . IL-22 has a dual role either protective or pathogenic functions during inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune diseases [11] ."

Tocilizumab, a specific monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6, has emerged as an alternative treatment for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with extensive lesions in the lungs and a confirmed elevated level of IL-6 [2] .

However, uncontrolled and excessive production of IL-17A is one of the mechanisms that have a key role in inflammatory conditions [6] . Infection is a complex series of interaction between the human host, the microbe and the environment. Host genomic variability has been linked to complications associated with infections. In COVID-19 pandemic, the identification of the host genomic factors that increase the resistance or the susceptibility to COVID-19 and translation of these findings to improve the patient care should be the goal [31] . Thus, genetic factors may determine the outcome of the disease rather than the level of the inflammatory markers. This may explain the lack of association between the studied inflammatory markers and the outcome of COVID-19 infection in this study."

Assessment of serum concentrations of 17A and IL-22: 8 Sampling: Samples were taken on the second day of presentation immediately after being confirmed as COVID-19 or MIS-c. Two ml whole blood samples were collected from all subjects. After clotting, samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes at approximately 1000\u00d7g. Sera were separated and stored at -20\u00b0C until time of assay. Principle of the assay: Serum concentrations of 17A and IL-22 were measured by using commercially supplied ELISA kits (Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd.). Principally, a capture antibody is pre-coated onto 96-well plates. Biotin conjugated antibodies are used as detection antibodies. Method of assay: At time of assay, samples were thawed to room temperature, vortexed and diluted as per the manufacturer's instructions; using the supplied dilution buffer, control samples were diluted 1:2 and patients' samples were diluted 1:5. The standards, diluted test samples and biotin conjugated detection antibody were subsequently added to the wells and washed with wash buffer after incubation. Then, HRP-Streptavidin was added and the unbound conjugates were washed away with a wash buffer. The TMB substrates were used to visualize HRP enzymatic reaction. TMB was catalyzed by using HRP to produce a blue color product that changed into yellow after adding acidic stop solution. The density of yellow color was proportional to the target amount of sample captured in plate. The O.D. absorbances of standards and samples were read at 450nm in a microplate reader, and then the concentration of target in each sample was calculated by constructing a standard curve via plotting the O.D. at 450nm of each standard solution on Y axis versus the respective concentration of the standard solution on X axis, then, target concentrations of samples were interpolated from the standard curve. The concentrations from interpolation were multiplied by the dilution factors to obtain the concentrations of targets in samples before dilution.",

Th1-Th17 cells are appearing to be the main source[13]. Clinical reports showed that both the mild and the severe forms of COVID-19 result in up-regulation of the cytokine secretion, particularly IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17[18]. A recent study conducted on 63 adult patients with COVID-19 reported a significant increase of the serum levels of IL-17 in the patients than the levels observed in the studied 33",

The IL-17 receptor antagonist knockout mice recruited fewer number of neutrophils to the airway in response to influenza A virus with a decreased mortality. Thus, targeting IL-17 in acute lung injury due to viral infection could be beneficial [27]. IL-22, in collaborate with IL-17 and TNF\u03b1, is known to induce antimicrobial peptides in the mucosal organs. However, IL-22 may induce inflammatory responses [10]. IL-22 up-regulates mucins, fibrinogen, anti-apoptotic proteins, serum amyloid A, and LPS binding protein [28]. Therefore, IL-22 may contribute to the formation of life-threatening edema enriched with mucins and fibrin, seen in COVID-19 [29]. This study revealed increased values of serum IL-17A and IL-22 in all patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Elevated CRP and serum ferritin were found in 90% of these patients. Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated, ALT, LDH and D-dimer were found in 45%, 42.5 %, 2.5%, 30%, 24.1%, 32.5%, 82.5%, and 65%, respectively of the all studied patients. Thus, serum IL-17A and IL-22 were the only inflammatory markers that were abnormally increased in the all studied patients. TH17 type response may contribute to the cytokine storm in some patients with pulmonary viral infection, including COVID-19, which results in tissue damage and likely promotes pulmonary edema [12].In this work, there were non-significant differences between the patients who had COVID-19 and those who had MIS-C in serum levels of IL-17A and IL-22.Thus, both cytokines were elevated to the same extent in COVID-19 and MIS-C and the inflammatory response was the same in both diseases.Despite the necessity, no reliable indicators are yet available to predict the disease progression and outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection[30]. The current study revealed non-significant differences between patients who recovered and those who died or had a residual illness in serum levels of IL-17A, IL-22 and the routine inflammatory markers of COVID-19. Thus, none of the studied inflammatory markers proved to be effective in the prediction of COVID-19 outcome. Our conclusions are limited by the sample size.",

The contradiction between the results of this study and the other studies may be attributed to the variations in the number and the age of the studied patients and the host genomic variability. The current study revealed significant positive correlations between serum levels of IL-17A and IL-22 in patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. This may be explained by the sharing of both cytokines with the cellular sources, signaling pathways, and some functional aspects. Both IL-17 and IL-22 are considered to be tissue-signaling cytokines that favor the protection and the regeneration of the epithelial barrier organs such as the lung, skin and gastrointestinal tract. IL-17 and IL-22 play essential roles in host defense against microbes and in the development of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Both cytokines enhance basic innate barrier defenses at mucosal surfaces and have a role in the rapid response to infectious agents, by recruiting neutrophils and by inducing the production of antimicrobial",
