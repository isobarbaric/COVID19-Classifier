            "text": "Based on serological studies of naturally infected populations, IgM antibodies are the first to be expressed and are mainly present in the circulation, promoting antigenic modulation (2, 3) . IgG antibodies begin to appear later in the immune response because they undergo affinity maturation through somatic mutations, resulting in high affinity for the target antigen and an enhanced ability to neutralise the pathogen (2) . SARS-CoV-2 particles contain four main structural proteins: spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Of these, spike protein (S) interacts with hosts' ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for entry (4) . Therefore, in terms of protection, the S protein is considered to be the most relevant antigen causing key antibody responses (5) . Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in the prevention and vaccine development of COVID-19 (6) . Currently, there is still a large global population in various forms of temporary quarantine to limit the spread of the virus, resulting in severe disruptions to international travel and local socioeconomic activities (2) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the nature and duration of immunization against SARS-CoV-2 since almost all epidemiological models, vaccination campaigns, and public health measures assume some degree of immunity during the COVID-19 recovery period (7) (8) (9) . Some studies in Iceland and the United States have shown that antibodies persist for more than 4 months after infection, but other studies have reported rapid fading of antibodies within 3-4 months (10) . Most of the available studies have explored the outcome of specific antibodies at 6 months or even 1 year. Nevertheless, we urgently need to understand the long-term durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses after symptom onset or RT-PCR confirmation, which is critical for learning the characteristics or patterns of antibody depletion. In addition, the increasing number of COVID-19 convalescent patients will want to know if they still need the vaccine and how many doses are sufficient."

Of these, 284 patients participated in the first follow-up visit, 318 in the second, and 228 in both rounds. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the detection of novel coronavirus nucleic acids in specimens such as nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory secretions, blood, stool, and urine using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and (next-generation sequencing) (NGS) were the primary criteria for diagnosis. All subjects included in this cohort met the above criteria. As in the first round (3), blood samples were collected from the second round of follow-up to measure the level of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and to monitor the dynamics of the antibodies in the body. The clinical data included immunization history of inactivated vaccine against COVID-19, demographics, and acute phase disease severity classification (Version 8 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19)."

Detailed information on the principle of the test, the procedure, and the sensitivity and specificity of this kit can be found in the first round of follow-up (3). The levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using ACE2-RBD inhibiting antibody concentration using the research kit (Bioscience Co.) conducted on the same automated magnetic chemiluminescence analyser. The chemiluminescent signal was measured as a relative light unit (RLU) using the optical system of the analyser. The titres of SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 competitive antibodies in the serum sample were measured as S/CO (sample/ cut-off) by comparing the RLU of a sample to the cut-off determined from standard curves. If the S/CO value is \u22652.0, the test result is positive, while if the S/CO value is <1.0, the result is considered negative; if between 1.0-2.0, the judgment is indeterminate and comprehensive judgment is recommended. The detection performance of the MCLIA kits for neutralization antibodies was reported by the manufacturer and the coincidence rate was 85-90%."

Understanding population-level seroprevalence and humoral immune kinetics is essential for vaccination strategies (14) . However, little is known about the durability of the long-term humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 (15). Dan et al. showed that the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody could be maintained for up to 8 months (16) . He et al. found that participants maintained their anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies for at least 9 months (15). Xiang et al. also found that most patients recovering from COVID-19 developed detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies 1 year after the onset of symptoms (5) . In our study, the rate of IgG positivity remained high at 80.19% during the almost 18 months of follow-up after symptom onset, and the IgG antibody level was 9.73 (95%CI, 8.28-11.19) . Researchers have reported that IgG persisted for more than 2 years in patients recovering from SARS (17, 18) . Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% genomic sequence homology with SARS-Cov (19) , we assume that IgG has the potential to continue to exist. In addition, several studies have shown that anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM levels decrease progressively over 3-5 months after infection (20) . Our study found that 20.44% of participants were positive for IgM 13-14 months after the onset of symptoms, which complements the results of existing studies. A previous study found that RBD-IgG persisted in 96.8% (31 of 32) of subjects at 14 months (21), which was slightly higher than 89.31% (284/318) at 15.6 months after symptom onset in our study.

Some reports have observed a correlation between antibody levels and male sex (23) (24) (25) , which is consistent with our findings on IgG antibody levels in vaccinated individuals. However, we also found that the IgG-positive rate was slightly higher in females, which could be an illusion due to the small number of vaccinees and the uneven ratio of males to females, to be further verified by expanding the sample size. There was evidence that IgG antibody levels were positively correlated with age (11, 23, 24, 26) , but we did not observe a significant difference in antibody levels between the age groups of 20-60 years and 60 years and above. In contrast, children and adolescents are more likely to be free of novel coronavirus or less symptomatic, and their immune response was not as violent as that of adults (27) (28) (29) (30) , consistent with our finding of lower antibody levels and positive rates in the <20 years age group. Compared to the other three clinical types, patients with the severe/critical type disease had higher antibody levels and positive rates, while those with the asymptomatic type disease had the lowest IgG levels and positive rates, which may be related to high levels of viral load or inflammatory storm in severe/critical patients (31) . Our study further confirmed the findings of a previous study (32) (33) (34) (35) . We performed multivariate regression analyses of antibody positive rate and level with the factors, incorporating the cross effect between these factors such as sex, age, disease severity, and vaccination into the model. The interaction between the factors was ultimately confirmed to be non-existent."

            "text": "The best indicator of vaccine protection is the epidemiological effectiveness of prevention. However, antibody levels can indirectly reflect the effectiveness of immune protection, as supported by Khoury et al. (36) . A key strength of this study was a 15.6 months-long follow-up of a population recovering from natural infection with COVID-19, incorporating inactivated vaccination as a factor for the first time, and assessing changes in the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including IgG, RBD-IgG, and neutralizing antibodies. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, IgG antibody levels of vaccinated individuals were elevated in overall, male, 30-40 age group, and asymptomatic and mild type groups; levels of RBD-IgG and neutralizing antibodies were increased in vaccinated individuals. These data illustrate the importance of improving vaccination uptake and aid in future COVID-19 public health measures. In addition, our study aimed to examine the effects of vaccination doses on vaccinated individuals. We found that in those with a single dose of the vaccine, IgG and neutralizing antibody levels were similar to those who received two doses, which serves as an effective immune booster (37, 38) , supporting the notion that one dose is sufficient for patients with a novel coronavirus issued by the Technical Guidelines for Vaccination against Novel Coronavirus (1st Version) (39) ."

However, due to the need for continuous, prolonged follow-up of convalescent patients in this study, there was a lack of sufficient participants and loss to follow-up, resulting in an under-representation of severe/critical illness (n=4) and poor extrapolation of measurements. Presently, there is an increasing number of viral variants, and the extent and persistence of the human immune response to them has not yet been studied, a gap that needs to be addressed in future studies."

People vaccinated with one dose of inactivated vaccine produced higher levels of antibodies than unvaccinated individuals, which was similar to those who received two doses. These findings can help governments and health authorities to implement more suitable vaccination strategies for people recovering from natural infections."
