Fundamental work at the interface of engineering and medicine has allowed nanomedicines to deliver therapeutic small molecules and nucleic acids more efficiently. While nanomedicines are used in oncology for immunotherapy or to deliver combinations of cytotoxics, the clinical successes of gene silencing approaches like patisiran lipid complexes (Onpattro\u00ae) have paved the way for a variety of therapies beyond cancer. In parallel, the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the potential of mRNA vaccines to develop immunization strategies at unprecedented speed. To rationally design therapeutic and vaccines, chemists, materials scientists, and drug delivery experts need to better understand how nanotechnologies interact with the immune system. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the innate and adaptative immune systems and emphasizes the intricate mechanisms through which nanomedicines interact with these biological functions."

Examples of ligands include various components of the wall of bacteria and fungi like lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and various \u03b2-glucans 12 Other important ligands of opsonic receptors are proteins of the complement system which will be described in more details below. Finally, apoptotic corpse receptors detect conformational changes in the phospholipid membrane of apoptotic cells.

The NOX2 enzyme consumes protons from the lumen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anions able to further degrade pathogens.

TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are found on the plasma membrane. In collaboration with coreceptors, they bind lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipopeptides, peptidoglycans, and bacterial flagella by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The binding of LPS to TLR4 and its coreceptor MD2 induces internalization 18 . Intracellular TLRs (3, 7, 8, and 9) are expressed in endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum, and can be recruited to the phagosome to sense its content. Examples of molecules that can be sensed by intracellular TLRs are single and double-stranded RNA, as well as CpG DNA motifs. These molecules are ligands for TLR7/8 (sRNA), TLR3 (dsRNA), and TLR9 (DNA). Activation of TLRs by their ligand induces J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cascades of signaling events which can translate into a type 1 interferon response or the production of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1)] 18 . These cytokines will impact the polarization of surrounding cells (see below)."

Due to the presence of intracellular granules, mast cells, and granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) are well equipped for these secretory functions 10 . Frustrated phagocytosis or direct activation of cellular receptors by ligands coming from the pathogen can trigger extracellular degranulation. Upon release, the content of these granules, which also include cytokines, acts as biological cues for surrounding cells. For example, the granules of eosinophils contain both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-5, chemokines, and growth factors which will influence chemotaxis and immune responses 20, 21 ."

For nanoparticles with no steric protection (i.e., high intrinsic clearance), independent studies showed that augmenting the injected dose resulted in non-linear increase in blood exposure [42] [43] [44] [45] . This phenomenon was attributed to the limited quantity of opsonins available in the bloodstream 42 or to the saturation of liver Kupffer cells and other phagocytes [43] [44] [45] . Interestingly, for nanoparticles which have lower affinity for the MPS due to their steric protection (i.e., PEGylated), increasing the dose within a 100-fold range did not prolong circulation times 43, 44 . Recently, our group confirmed that a threshold of approximately 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 might be necessary to prevent early J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clearance of polymer nanoparticles by the MPS, but that higher PEGylation densities did not necessarily translate into higher blood exposure 46 ."

For example, the injection of large liposomes containing clodronate can efficiently deplete Kupffer cells in the liver 47 . This model was used to increase the circulation times and tumor distribution of PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes and other types of nanoparticles 48, 49 . Although this strategy can result in increased therapeutic efficacy 48 , its clinical relevance remains questionable as it might also make animals (and potentially humans) more susceptible to bacterial infections 48 . Interestingly, in both aforementioned studies, the depletion of Kupffer cells resulted in increased splenic distribution 48, 49 . This supports the role of the spleen to sieve colloids that are not efficiently retained by the liver 50 ."

For example, the tumor distribution and efficacy of small PEGylated nanoparticles was significantly increased when mice were pre-dosed with high quantities of non-PEGylated liposomes (375 mg/kg), 1.5 h before treatment 51 . Likewise, in a thorough and elegant study, Nikitin and colleagues 52 proposed that pre-dosing rodents with allogeneic anti-erythrocytes IgG2a could prolong the circulation times of various colloidal systems, including PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin. The forced clearance of red blood cells, 12 h before the injection of nanomedicines, resulted in increased circulation times compared to animals primed with vehicle. Although particles with very high clearance benefited the most from the phenomenon, forced clearance of erythrocytes appeared to induce a 1.6-fold increase in the blood exposure of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin 52 . Importantly, in a murine model of melanoma, PEGylated liposomes showed improved antitumor efficacy when the MPS was saturated."

Using a variety of techniques, including intravital imaging, they showed that the clearance rates of gold nanoparticles significantly increased when a minimum threshold of 10 12 injected particles per mouse was reached. Doses above this number resulted in decreased J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f accumulation in macrophages and increased tumor deposition, for gold and silica nanoparticles, as well as PEGylated liposomes 53 . To further showcase the relevance of this threshold, one single administration of a fixed quantity of PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes (ca. 5\u00d710 12 particles, 2 mg/kg of doxorubicin) had significantly increased antitumor efficacy when delivered with a large quantity of empty particles (ca. 5\u00d710 13 empty particles). Time will tell if this threshold can translate to humans by allometric conversions, and whether the phenomenon, obtained with single dose administrations, holds true for multiple dose regimens used in the clinics."

The C3b fragment can covalently bind to carbohydrates and amines on the surface of the pathogen, via a thioester moiety which is exposed upon activation. The C3a protein does not directly interact with the pathogen but is involved in recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages to the site of infection. The classical pathway involves the binding of C1q protein to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins found on the surface of pathogens (IgM or IgG). C1q also bind to lipid A, \u03b2-sheet amyloid fibrils, pentraxins, and apoptotic cells 61 . The lectin pathway differs from the classical pathway only in the initial stimuli responsible for the conversion of C4 into its bioactive fragments. Instead of relying on the presence of surface antibodies, the lectin pathway is initiated by lectin binding to mannose residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids, or by ficolins binding to N-acetylated surfaces. Each mannose binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin associates with serine proteases, forming the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) complexes."

Cleavage of the protein C5 by the C5 convertase leads to the release of the anaphylatoxin C5a, while the larger fragment, C5b protein, remains bound to the C5 convertase. The enzymatic cascade ends on the formation of C5b-9, terminal complement complex (TCC), or membrane attack complex, resulting from the association of C5b with the proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9.

Despite the necessary role of complement proteins to fight some pathogen infections 68, 69 , bona fide demonstrations of the impact of complement on the blood clearance of nanoparticles remain scarce. As early as the 1990s, some reports showed that in vitro complement activation by liposomes was not always predictive of circulation times in vivo 70 . Szoka and his group 71 showed that inhibiting the complement system in mice did not significantly alter the pattern of gene expression, in the lungs, liver, and spleen, observed after intravenous injection of cationic transfecting liposomes."

Like in other reports 37 , they observed that cellular uptake could be prevented by pre-incubation of the nanoparticles with plasma proteins. Interestingly, they J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f showed that the adsorption of the protein clusterin (apolipoprotein J) on the surface of nanoparticles could inhibit the in vitro uptake in macrophages by >70% 79 . In our own hands, preincubation of PEGylated nanoparticles with clusterin before intravenous injection to healthy mice resulted in increased blood circulation times only for particles with very low PEG densities (<20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 ) 46 . In the same work, we also showed that nanoparticles with low steric protection were cleared much faster in transgenic mice which did not express apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein responsible for lipid trafficking in the blood. It is therefore possible that clusterin and other apolipoproteins, which interact physiologically with hydrophobic biological constituents, bind to the surface of nanoparticles with low PEG densities to somehow stabilize them. This effect would be less perceptible with systems which have inherently higher steric protection 46 . "

While C57bl/6 mice exhibit a general susceptibility to type 1 polarization, the response of BALB/c mice is biased toward type 2. In a very interesting study, the teams of Bear and DeSimone 87 have compared the clearance of nanoparticles in type 1-and type 2-biased mouse strains. During the 2 h that followed the intravenous injection of cylindrical, negatively charged, 300-nm PEG-hydrogels, type 1-biased mice (C57bl/6 and B10D2) had at least a 4-fold higher blood exposure than their type 2 counterparts (BALB/c and DBA2) 87 . These differences were also noticeable for 30-nm quantum dots, but not for 6-\u03bcm microparticles. The authors ascribe these distinctions to a higher expression of mannan receptors on the surface of phagocytes from BALB/c mice, compared to C57bl/6 animals. It is unclear how this phenomenon translates to other materials. In this experiment, the clearances of the studied materials were relatively fast, as all had <25% of the initial signal remaining in the blood 2 h after injection 87 . Independently, we also compared the pharmacokinetics of 90-nm polymer nanoparticles with different PEG densities in BALB/c and C57bl/6 mice 46 . Over 6 h after intravenous injection, the blood exposure observed with nanoparticles with low steric protection (i.e., 15 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 ) was approximately 1.8-fold higher in C57bl/6, compared to BALB/c mice. Interestingly, these differences disappeared for nanoparticles with slower clearances 46 . Altogether, this suggests that differences J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between type 1/2-biased strains might be more important for nanoparticles which are quickly removed from the circulation than for longer-circulating systems."

Three intravenous injections of these sophisticated nanovesicles to C57bl/6 mice bearing subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma, resulted in increased tumor levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12, and reduced amounts of IL-10, strongly supporting a shift toward a type 1 response 92 . In this metastatic-prone cancer model, treatment with nanovesicles was able to prevent cancer recurrences after surgical tumor ablation and significantly prolong survival. Interestingly, the nanovesicles were much less potent in a triple-negative breast cancer model (4T1 cells) implanted in BALB/c mice. To achieve comparable efficacy in these type 2 biased animals, encapsulation in nanovesicles of cyclic GMP-AMP, a strong ligand of the intracytoplasmic pattern receptor STING, was necessary 92 . During their journey, if dendritic cells sense sufficient danger signals from the internalized pathogen (e.g., activation of TLR by DAMPs), it will upregulate the costimulatory protein B7 involved in the activation of T cells. Free antigens from the extracellular fluid can also passively drain to lymphoid organs where they can be internalized and presented by residing dendritic cells or B cells 96 . Some evidence also exists that monocytes can enter tissues without differentiation, up-regulate expression of MHC class II molecules, take up antigens and deliver them to lymph "

In contrast, lymph-borne vesicular stomatitis viruses (70 nm\u00d7180 nm cylinders) are captured by macrophages in the subcapsular sinus 101 Through a gene rearrangement process unique to B and T cells called V(D)J recombination, each clone expresses a single and randomly generated surface receptor. Although the biological mechanisms responsible for clonal diversity are beyond the scope of this review, the outcome is that each B-or T-cell receptor on immature lymphocytes recognizes a unique peptide. At this stage, the receptors that bind antigens are generated randomly and without consideration to self or non-self. Cells which are not useful or possibly harmful are eradicated from the repertoire by the selection of clones. Cells that bind self MHC class molecules too weakly or too strongly and those that recognize peptides belonging to the host (i.e., possibly selfreactive) will be eliminated by apoptosis. By the end of this process, each mature lymphocyte can recognize one out of 10 6 different possible foreign peptides."

For example, the physiological PD-1/PD-L1 immunoregulatory pathway is an inhibitory checkpoint which prevents CD8 + from eliciting their cytotoxic activity 119 . In healthy tissues, the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 protects against self-reactivity, but these cell-cell interactions can also be exploited by cancer cells to bypass immune surveillance. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, which disrupt the inhibitory effect, achieve very high success rates in patients suffering from melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other types of cancers, but some tumors remain refractive 119 ."

Intravenous injection of their candidate also resulted in significant plasma concentration of the encoded protein, but this administration method is not currently used in clinical vaccination regimens.

A follow up study in primates showed that two intramuscular injections of 100 \u03bcg of mRNA-1273, at a 4-week interval, could raise a neutralizing humoral response in rhesus macaques 128 . In that study, the presence of spike-specific CD4 + follicular lymphocytes and T H 1 cells was confirmed, and no T H 2 polarization nor specific CD8 + T cells were detected. Four weeks after the second vaccination, antibodies could protect animals against intratracheal challenges with 7.6\u00d710 5 plaque-forming units of the virus, as evidenced by genome counts in bronchoalveolar fluid and nasal swabs 128 . The interim results of the phase I clinical trial in 45 healthy patients (18-55 years of age) showed that two injections of mRNA-1273, 28 days apart, induced dose-dependent antigen-binding titers 132 . Combining in vitro pseudovirus and wild-type virus neutralizing assays, antibody protection appeared comparable to that measured in sera from convalescent patients, especially after the second vaccination. Similar to data obtained in primates, a CD4 + T H 1-biased response was confirmed by the expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-2, and IFN\u03b3, and low levels of spike-specific CD8 + response was observed 132 . A randomized, placebocontrolled, phase III study was conducted in +30,000 patients to evaluate two 100-\u03bcg intramuscular doses of the vaccine, administered 28 days apart 133 . Over 120 days following randomization, 11 infections were diagnosed in patients that had received mRNA-1273, compared to 185 in the placebo group, hence an estimated efficacy of 94% 133 . Importantly, the vaccine appeared to efficiently protect against the severe form of the disease which occurred in 30 participants form the placebo group, but none from the treatment arm."

When designing novel therapeutics, understanding of the complex relationships between biological functions might be valuable to predict possible inefficacies and adverse reactions. Whether the intended purpose of the technology is to deliver therapeutic payloads more efficiently or to vaccinate against pathogens, being able to foresee how the host will react to single and multiple doses is critical. Opportunities will continue to arise to encapsulate, protect and efficiently deliver drugs and other molecules for a variety of human diseases. Similarly, although it is too soon to predict whether nanosized vaccines will be our ticket out of the global COVID-19 pandemic which has affected us all, the rapid development of Moderna's mRNA-1273 and BioNTech's BNT162b1 have clearly consolidated interest toward mRNA vaccines.
