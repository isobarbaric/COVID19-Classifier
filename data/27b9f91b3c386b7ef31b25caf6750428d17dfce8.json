A mixed-methods analysis of ninety-six examples of visuals in misinformation rated false or misleading by independent professional fact-checkers from the first three months of 2020 identifies and examines six frames and three distinct functions of visuals in pieces of misinformation: how visuals illustrate and selectively emphasize arguments and claims, purport to present evidence for claims, and impersonate supposedly authoritative sources for claims. Notably, visuals in more than half of the pieces of misinformation analyzed explicitly serve as evidence for false claims, most of which are mislabelled rather than manipulated. While this analysis uncovered a small number of manipulated visuals, all were produced using simple tools; there were no examples of \"deepfakes\" or other artificial intelligence-based techniques.

At the same time, scholars, journalists, fact-checkers, and policymakers have often approached misinformation through a representational paradigm focused somewhat narrowly on whether visuals and texts represent or contradict the best available evidence. While the representational aspects of misinformation are deeply important, research, both in visual studies and on the role of visuals in scientific research (Daston 2014) , demonstrates that some visuals not only represent, they also constitute and coproduce objects and authority. In particular, photographs and videos do so in part through their assumed indexicality, a \"physical connection\" (Peirce 1955: 106) to the objects they depict. Without discounting the importance of attending to the representational dimensions of misinformation, we argue that to advance understanding of the role of visuals in COVID-19 misinformation and misinformation more broadly it is important to look beyond the representational capacities of visuals. This is powerfully illustrated by our finding that while the visuals in more than half of the pieces of misinformation in our sample are presented as evidence for false claims, the visuals themselves are mostly mislabelled or used in other misleading ways, but are not, when considered in isolation, false or manipulated.",

Recent work by Hemsley and Snyder, for instance, provides a framework of how visual artifacts contribute to misinformation (Hemsley and Snyder 2018) while Hameleers, Powell, et al. (2020) investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal (text-plus-visual) disinformation, finding that multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Despite these examples, broader studies of visuals in misinformation remain few and far between. A likely explanation for the dearth of studies is that collecting, storing, and analyzing visual content, especially at scale, presents significant practical and methodological challenges. Some have approached these challenges by choosing to analyze image metrics or metadata rather than parsing visual content itself. Notably, a number of studies have used this approach to assess the amount or prominence of misinformation or low-quality information on YouTube (cf. M. N. .",

Visual framing analysis is becoming a prominent form of visual analysis. Coleman (2010) defines visual framing as a form of framing analysis. She draws on Entman's (1993: 52) well-known definition of framing to define visual framing as the \"selection of one view, scene, or angle when making the image, cropping, editing or selecting it\" (Coleman 2010: 237) that \"selects some aspects of a perceived reality and makes them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation\" (p. 235). Importantly, visual material often occurs along with text. While the frames communicated in text and visuals do not always align, Coleman concludes that nonetheless, \"it is never enough to study framing in one mode of communication and not the other\" (Coleman 2010: 237) . Instead, we must adopt a multimodal framing approach that acknowledges and investigates how text and visuals align, conflict, and/or are intertwined. That is the approach we adopt here.",

As Bock (2020) notes, this diversity has meant that \"visual framing suffers from the same theoretical cloudiness as framing generally\" (p. 4). Addressing the \"theoretical cloudiness\" of visual framing, Bock (2020) offers a three-part model that aims to push research beyond \"literal depictions and descriptions\" to realize \"the paradigm's explanatory and critical potential\" (p. 1) by recognizing the work that visual framing can do in the wider world, well beyond merely representing it.",

Recognizing the wider roles that visuals serve has been key to visual studies and visual culture research (Mitchel 2005) . For some, this imperative is rooted in the work of the philosopher C.S Peirce, whose influential theory of signs holds that while symbols have no necessary connection to their referent, and icons bear a visual similarity, indices have a \"physical connection\" and a causal relationship to their referents (Peirce 1955: 106) . For the past 150 years, scholars have argued for and against the indexicality of photographs, and the ways in which \"photographs come with an implicit guarantee of being closer to the truth than other forms of communication are\" (Messaris and Abraham 2001: 217 ).

Given how much of it purports to deal with scientific issues, this literature is particularly relevant for understanding the role of visuals in COVID-19 misinformation. Situating visuals within scientific practice involves attempting \"to think about images beyond representation\" (Daston 2014: 320) : to recognize the wider universe of connections and practices in which visuals participate. Moving beyond representation means shifting from an epistemological treatment of visuals to an ontological one. Such a move would \"collapse the distance between presentation and representation: the image is the presentation\" (Daston 2014: 320-21) . In part, this is to acknowledge that visuals are performative (MacKenzie 2006) , that they don't just represent, they also constitute or coproduce (Jasanoff 2004 ) the objects we encounter in the world. Understanding the complex roles that visualizations play in scientific practice can help us move beyond a narrow concern with the gap between visuals and the reality they purport to represent and see the diverse set of practices and relations that visuals produce and are produced by. As one of the \"working object[s] of science\" (Daston 2014: 320) , and of misinformation (Garimella and Eckles 2020), visuals matter because of what they help constitute and facilitate.",

They rolled in a volleyball to Tom Hanks to keep him company while quarantined. \" The fact-checker labeled this as false, noting that despite being intended as a joke or satire, the image was digitally manipulated and that some social media users \"circulated that photo as being real\" (Schakohl 2020).",

Every example of manipulated content in our sample employed simple photo or video editing techniques. We saw no examples of deepfakes or other AI-based manipulations. This is notable given the frequent concern expressed in both scholarly and public discussion about the threat deepfakes pose. While deepfakes may become more common over time, our findings suggest that, at least for now, misinformation producers are employing simpler means of producing false or misleading content. This finding also supports Paris and Donovan's (2019) claim that successfully deceptive media are often \"cheap fakes,\" not necessarily requiring advanced processing technologies.",

Most notably, we found that visuals were used as false evidence for claims, helping to establish objects as specific as a diseased chicken or as diffuse as a global conspiracy. Scholars would be well served by attending to the ways that visuals-whether taken out of context or manipulated-can work to ground and support false or misleading claims. There is reason to suspect that this sort of evidentiary support can bring into being claims that take on a life of their own-that move and grow and build new constituting networks of support (see Latour 1986) . While it may be too early to tell how COVID-19 misinformation plays out in terms of its public health consequences, the example of the anti-vaccine movement is instructive. Even after the original 1998 Lancet article suggesting a link between vaccines and autism was discredited and retracted, the movement has persisted and likely even grown wider (A. Schmidt et al. 2018) . While fact-checking is broadly effective in countering false beliefs (Walter et al. 2020; Wood and Porter 2019) , it may still have limited efficacy in stopping some of the particularly pernicious effects of misinformation, especially around misappropriated visual material.",

While not directly supplying evidence for a claim, here visuals are meant to provide legitimacy or authority to claims. In light of the finding that the most prevalent frame observed concerns \"authoritative agency,\" these dynamics point to a need to further interrogate the relationships between visuals in misinformation and authority or power. Of course, disentangling the ways in which visual framing is implicated in complicated power dynamics has become a central goal of many strands of visual analysis, including visual framing (Bock 2020) . At a minimum, our findings suggest that visuals play more complicated roles in conveying COVID-19 misinformation than merely depicting everyday objects and exaggerating their importance. Instead, we see visuals enfolded in far larger questions of politics and power, such as the authority of the United Nations or U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rights of immigrants, or geopolitical conflict between India and China. In much of the material we analyzed, the visuals themselves were not in isolation false or misleading representations of reality, nor were they fabricated or, in most cases, manipulated. Instead, their role goes beyond representation narrowly articulated and is largely illustrative, performative, and communicative.",

While establishing authority and facticity requires the representational capacities of visuals, these functions also speak to something beyond representation. In these instances, visuals not only represent the world, they also help construct or coproduce the claims made and attempt to bring into being objects and authorities, such as supposedly infected chickens, global conspiracies, or a harmless virus. Scholars of visual communication have long recognized the diverse roles visuals can play. Yet scholars of misinformation have not always considered the wider functions that misinformation serves beyond its representational capacity. Although some have begun to investigate these questions (e.g., Marwick 2018; Polletta and Callahan 2017;",
