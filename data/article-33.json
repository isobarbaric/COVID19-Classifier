Design Cross-sectional analyses using two nationally representative surveys collected during the first and second month after the 2020 lockdown in the UK. Setting and participants Participants (age 17 years and above) from the first wave of the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study are linked to the most recent wave before the pandemic completed during 2018 and 2019 (n=14 073). COVID-19 Survey Data was collected from 2 to 31 May 2020 (n=8547) with participants drawn from five nationally representative cohort studies in the UK. Analysis We conducted bivariate analyses to examine gender gaps in change in sleep problems and change in sleep duration overall and by other predictors. A series of multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were estimated to explore predictors of change in sleep problems and change in sleep time."

            "text": "Results People in the UK on average experienced an increase in sleep loss during the first 4 weeks of the lockdown (mean=0.13, SD=0.9). Women report more sleep loss than men (coefficient=0.15, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.19). Daily sleep duration on average increased by ten minutes (mean=\u22120.16, SD=1.11), with men gaining eight more minutes of sleep per day than women (coefficient=0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.17). Conclusion The COVID-19 related measures amplified traditional gender roles. Men's sleep was more affected by changes in their financial situation and employment status related to the crisis, with women more influenced by their emotional reaction to the pandemic, feeling anxious and spending more time on family duties such as home schooling, unpaid domestic duties, nurturing and caregiving. Based on our findings, we provide policy advice of early, clear and better employment protection coverage of self-employed and precarious workers and employer recognition for parents."

The pandemic deeply impacted the daily lives of individuals, families and workers. Lockdown measures compelled people to stay at home, businesses and schools to close and the suspension of work or firing of employees. Lockdowns forced individuals to live in entirely new ways by home schooling children and experiencing unprecedented work-life conflict, anxiety and economic hardship. In addition to economic and coordination problems, these changes had the potential to induce psychological discomfort related to loss of control and uncertainty. One way to measure the deep mental health impacts of lockdown is through sleep loss and disruption, which has the potential for both short but also longer term negative health consequences. A recent study found that COVID-19 related measures impacted sleep on a global level and the disturbed sleep during the pandemic is strongly linked with mental distress. 1 Sleep is regulated by circadian rhythms, synchronised by external diurnal cycles, including sunlight and temperature. 2 This internal clock tells our bodies when to sleep, wake and eat. In modern societies, human's circadian clocks are also structured by daily employment and school schedules. Beyond"

Indoor lighting, exposure to light pollution from streets and electronic devices such as laptops and smartphones places more individuals at risk of circadian disruption. With social distancing protocols in place amid the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals were increasingly connecting to the outside world through screens. The unexpected changes in lifestyles due to the pandemic may have interrupted the sleep-wake cycle in both infected patients and the general population and have short-term and long-term physiological, behavioural, cognitive and emotional consequences. 3 Sleep is essential for physical 4 and mental functioning. 5 Sleep deprivation has been related to lower cognitive functioning, higher accident rates and increased interpersonal conflict. 6 The impact of COVID-19 on sleep disruption, however, is not equally distributed. Previous research found that women have distinct and higher levels of sleep problems and disruption already in nonpandemic conditions. 7 Gender differences in change in sleep problems and sleep duration during lockdown can be a function of compositional differences in work and family responsibilities, and psychological distress that may induced by health conditions, employment and financial circumstances. Initial research using one survey found that women have been more vulnerable to sleep deprivation during lockdown 1 and more prone to suffer from anxiety in the early stages of lockdown. 8 However, evidence explaining such gender gap in sleep is limited and has not been replicated across multiple studies."

COVID-19 has brought considerable and deep impacts to people's social life and daily routines, but the burden is not equally distributed by gender. 12 For example, since gender norms and predominant working patterns in the UK position men as the primary earners and women as the primary care givers, the spatial boundary between work and family life was blurred during the work-from-home period. 13 Second, although some preliminary studies exist, they examine only one sample and do not focus in detail on gender differences. The current study draws from multiple longitudinal representative surveys in the UK to test and replicate our findings. Third, most COVID-19 studies are cross-sectional and therefore lack a benchmark of individuals' behaviour prior to the pandemic. By using pre-existing longitudinal surveys, we are able to gauge changes in sleep disruption by comparing information from previous waves prior to the pandemic. A related and fourth contribution is that we draw on data from national representative surveys, moving away from small selective samples. A fifth extension that we assess is the sleep gender gap across the different domains of employment, time use, life course stage, financial implications and psychological distress."

Men's sleep quality, however, was more sensitive to changes in the financial situation. This is attributed to gendered trade-offs in employment between couples. Women are prone to reduce paid work when caregiving responsibilities and unpaid work are highest, whereas men often increase paid work when becoming fathers. 17 The self-employed had significantly more sleep problems, reflecting rising anxieties and fear of uncertainty over the future. They also slept more, likely due to business closure and shifts in time use. Our results indicate that entrepreneurs and those with small businesses or start-ups experienced stress and anxiety regarding job continuity and financial security.

            "text": "Our study indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown amplified traditional gender roles, which is reflected in the gendered factors associated with sleep. Men's sleep was more affected by changes in their financial situation and employment status related to the crisis, highlighting their roles as providers in the family. Women's sleep, however, was more influenced by their emotional reaction to the pandemic, feeling more anxious and spending more time on family duties such as home schooling, unpaid domestic duties, nurturing and caregiving. Although the purpose of this article was to explain the gender gap in change in sleep during COVID-19, changes could not all be successfully explained away by gender differences. This is likely due to some underlying biological differences, such as hormonal changes, which have been shown as one of the mechanisms contributing to sleep differences between the sexes 22 and to have a stronger influence on women. 7 For change in sleep problems, coefficient larger than zero means increased sleep problems, ranging from \u22123 to 3. For change in sleep duration, the coefficient indicates change in number of hours slept per night ranging from \u22127 to 7 hours. Positive coefficient means slept longer and vice versa."
