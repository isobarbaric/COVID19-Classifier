            "text": "Single-column (batch) preparative chromatography is the technique of choice for 19 purification of biotherapeutics but it is often characterized by an intrinsic limitation in terms 20 of yield-purity trade-off, especially for separations containing a larger number of product-21 related impurities. This drawback can be alleviated by employing multicolumn continuous 22 chromatography. Among the different methods working in continuous mode, in this paper 23 we will focus in particular on Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification 24 (MCSGP) which has been specifically designed for challenging separations of target 25 biomolecules from their product-related impurities. The improvements come from the 26 automatic internal recycling of the impure fractions inside the chromatographic system, 27 which results in an increased yield without compromising the purity of the pool. In this 28 article, steps of the manufacturing process of biopharmaceuticals will be described, as well 29 as the advantages of continuous chromatography over batch processes, by particularly 30 focusing on MCSGP. 31 32 33 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Keywords: 34 Continuous Chromatography, Preparative Chromatography, Purification, Multicolumn 35 Platforms, Biopharmaceuticals, Biotherapeutics 36 37 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Indeed, they show high specificity towards the target receptors, which makes them very 41 effective even at low concentrations [1,2]. Moreover, most of them are also present in the 42 human body, therefore their side effects are reduced if compared to other chemical drugs. In 43 the last months, their potential has been even more rekindled due to the fact that many of the 44 therapeutics currently under testing for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 disease 45 are based on biopharmaceuticals (especially monoclonal antibodies or oligonucleotides) [3-46 5]."

The 48 method chosen to obtain the biomolecule of interest represents the upstream step of the 49 manufacturing process [6,7]. For instance, recombinant technology is the main method to 50 obtain monoclonal antibodies, hormones and blood factors. In this context, continuous 51 bioreactors (e.g., perfusion bioreactors) are getting ever more popular, at the point that they 52 have started to replace traditional batch processes. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals can be 53 extracted from their natural source or they can be chemically synthesized.

In order to do that, the product must be 82 separated also from product-related impurities, which are, instead, very often similar to the 83 target molecule (e.g., truncated, deamidated species, etc.) [17]. Most of the time, this is a 84 very challenging task. Affinity chromatography cannot be applied at this stage because of 85 the similarity between the target product and the impurities. Therefore reversed-phase, ion-86 exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography are rather preferred as methods of 87 choice [6]. In order to improve the resolution of the peaks, it is advisable to work in gradient 88 conditions, since the retention of biomolecules is largely dependent on the composition of 89 the mobile phase (e.g., on the salt concentration or on the percentage of organic modifier) 90 [9,18-20]."

            "text": "Conversely to preparative batch chromatography process, the MCSGP technique, for its 241 intrinsic features, allows to obtain the target product with high purity and high yield at the 242 same time. The main factor enabling an improved performance of MCSGP compared to that 243 of the batch process is the automatic internal recycling of the partially purified side 244 fractions. When working in batch chromatography, the side portions of the main peak, 245 containing both W (or S) and a remarkable amount of P, are discarded from the main 246 collection window but most of the time they are manually reprocessed into the system by 247 the operator, with risk of error and waste of time [41]. In twin-column MCSGP, on the 248 contrary, the recycle is accomplished automatically between the two columns, with no need 249 of intervention by the operator. The two identical columns work either in series 250 (interconnected mode) or in parallel (batch mode), depending on the position of the inlet 251 and outlet column valves [42,43]. When transferring a method from batch to continuous 252 chromatography, this method is performed on both the columns, but shifted of half a cycle 253 [22]. 254 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \u2022 Now that column-2 has been fully loaded, it can undergo the solvent gradient: W 272 impurities start eluting (zone 4); on the other side, column-1 is being stripped to remove 273 S and it is also equilibrated (zone 8). 274 275 At this point, the columns have switched position. When they exchange position again and 276 return to the initial configurations, a cycle is completed. Thus, one cycle is composed of two 277 switches. Generally, after few switches, the chromatographic system reaches the steady-278 state, which is demonstrated by the fact that that the UV profiles are completely 279 superimposable cycle after cycle. The reader should note that UV profiles are detected at the 280 outlet of the column, before the eluent stream is sent to the waste, to the fractionator or to 281 the other column. Under steady-state conditions, then, very close values of purity and 282 recovery are obtained for every collected pool. Therefore, after the steady state has been 283 reached, the number of cycles to be performed for the entire purification process depends 284 essentially on the amount of fresh feed that must be purified. In order to better understand 337 windows. Fig. 2 represents an ideal case where no product is wasted in zones 4 and 8, 338 however in other cases it is preferable to waste a small amount of very impure product in 339 these zones rather than risking the accumulation of impurities in the system during 340 recycling. Since the values of purity and recovery for each cycle are constant after the 341 steady state has been reached, in MCSGP one obtains a point and not a Pareto curve. If the 342 point of the MCSGP lies below the Pareto curve, the MCSGP process can be considered 343 unsuccessful, meaning that it reaches a lower recovery than the batch at the same purity. On 344 the opposite, if the point lies above the Pareto curve, this means that the recovery of 345 MCSGP has overcome that of the batch. From a practical viewpoint it must be said that 346 points on the top right corner of the graphic are an indication of a successful MCSGP. This 347 concept can be better visualized by looking at Fig. 5. This graphic shows from a purely 348 qualitative point of view a Pareto curve related to a batch chromatogram where the purest 349 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fraction (99% purity) corresponds to only 15% of recovery, whereas if yield were 100%, 350"
