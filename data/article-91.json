This drawback can be alleviated by employing multicolumn continuous 22 chromatography. Among the different methods working in continuous mode, in this paper 23 we will focus in particular on Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification 24 (MCSGP) which has been specifically designed for challenging separations of target 25 biomolecules from their product-related impurities. The improvements come from the 26 automatic internal recycling of the impure fractions inside the chromatographic system, 27 which results in an increased yield without compromising the purity of the pool. In this 28 article, steps of the manufacturing process of biopharmaceuticals will be described, as well 29 as the advantages of continuous chromatography over batch processes, by particularly 30 focusing on MCSGP. 31 32 33 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Keywords: 34 Continuous Chromatography, Preparative Chromatography, Purification, Multicolumn 35 Platforms, Biopharmaceuticals, Biotherapeutics 36 37 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Indeed, they show high specificity towards the target receptors, which makes them very 41 effective even at low concentrations [1,2]. Moreover, most of them are also present in the 42 human body, therefore their side effects are reduced if compared to other chemical drugs. In 43 the last months, their potential has been even more rekindled due to the fact that many of the 44 therapeutics currently under testing for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 disease 45 are based on biopharmaceuticals (especially monoclonal antibodies or oligonucleotides) [3-46 5].In the last years, manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals has been intensively improved. The 48 method chosen to obtain the biomolecule of interest represents the upstream step of the 49 manufacturing process [6,7]. For instance, recombinant technology is the main method to 50 obtain monoclonal antibodies, hormones and blood factors. In this context, continuous 51 bioreactors (e.g., perfusion bioreactors) are getting ever more popular, at the point that they 52 have started to replace traditional batch processes. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals can be 53 extracted from their natural source or they can be chemically synthesized. The latter 54 strategy, anyway, can be applied only to produce short biopolymeric chains, e.g.polypeptides. These recent innovations in the upstream of biopharmaceuticals have not been 56 followed by similar enhancement in the downstream process, at the point that the latter 57 currently represents a bottleneck in the whole production of biotherapeutics [8,9,10]. The 58 term downstream in general indicates both the recovery and the purification of a product 59 from a complex mixture [11]. The purification methods of choice must distinguish between 60 molecules that often show only slight variations in size, hydrophobicity or charge. The most 61 versatile, selective and flexible technique to satisfy this need is liquid chromatography.Usually, more than one chromatographic step is required to satisfy the specifications 63 imposed to reach the market [12, 13]. Traditionally, these chromatographic purification 64 processes are conducted in batch conditions, often using a single chromatographic column 65 [14].In general, at least two different purification steps are usually necessary to isolate the target 67 product with the required purity. The first part of the purification process is the removal of 68 process-related impurities, i.e. species that are not chemically similar to the target molecule 69 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f purification of monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs), since it allows binding mAbs specifically 77 but reversibly [16]. During this phase, it is important to ensure the recovery of the 78 maximum amount of the target, whereas it is not necessary to satisfy strict purity 79 requirements.After the capture step, one or more polishing steps are required in order to satisfy the 81 rigorous purity requirements for pharmaceuticals. In order to do that, the product must be 82 separated also from product-related impurities, which are, instead, very often similar to the 83 target molecule (e.g., truncated, deamidated species, etc.) [17]. Most of the time, this is a 84 very challenging task. Affinity chromatography cannot be applied at this stage because of 85 the similarity between the target product and the impurities. Therefore reversed-phase, ion-86 exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography are rather preferred as methods of 87 choice [6]. In order to improve the resolution of the peaks, it is advisable to work in gradient 88 conditions, since the retention of biomolecules is largely dependent on the composition of 89 the mobile phase (e.g., on the salt concentration or on the percentage of organic modifier) 90 [9,18-20].In preparative chromatography, the similarity between the target and its impurities often 92 result in peaks overlapping, where the target product is intermediate between weakly and 93 strongly adsorbing impurities [21]. Consequently, collecting a considerable amount of pure 94 product is almost impossible. In fact, a widening of the collection window results in an 95 improved yield at expenses of a reduced purity and vice versa. This translates in a yield-96 purity trade-off, a limit peculiar to batch chromatography [22].97 In this frame, multicolumn continuous chromatographic approaches have become 98 increasingly appealing in the field of high value biological products [15], due to the 99 possibility of partially overcoming this limitation. In general, multicolumn continuous 100 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 121 122 Also, recovery (or yield) of the target at the end of the process needs to be carefully 123 evaluated. This is particularly important when very expensive Active Pharmaceutical 124 Ingredients (APIs) are purified. It is defined as the mass fraction of the product recovered in 125 the eluted stream with respect to the mass of the product dissolved in the feed injected into 126 the column. Recovery % = \u00d7 100 (2) 129 130 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the purity in the pool will be elevated. However, a considerable amount of product still 150 underlies the overlapping portions of the peak. If the collection window is broadened, yield 151 will increase but at the same time purity will decrease since portions of the peak 152 contaminated with impurities are collected. This trade-off is a limit intrinsic to batch 153 chromatography. The difficulty of reaching a good purity and a good yield at the same time 154 makes traditional batch chromatography often impractical [24].One could think of decreasing the loading of the feed or the gradient slope, but this would 156 lead to longer times and in turn to higher solvent consumption and lower productivity.Alternatively, more efficient columns can be used but smaller particles would lead to higher 158 backpressures. Therefore, none of these options can effectively be a solution to the problem 159 [25,26]. 160 161 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f means of HPLC to obtain a purity profile (zones 2-5).As reported in Fig. 1 , the zones defining the recycling and collection windows in the batch 229 process are delimited by some characteristic times, which are necessary to transfer a 230 chromatographic method from batch to the MCSGP process, as it will be explained in the 231 following.Also, it must be highlighted that the letter W (or S) does not refer to a single weakly (or 233 strongly) adsorbing species, but rather to a group of impurities which have a similar 234 chromatographic behavior.The chromatogram obtained in batch is then used to design the MCSGP process, thus it is 236 called design batch chromatogram. It must be calculated on one of the two columns that 237 will be employed for MCSGP.239Operating principles of MCSGPConversely to preparative batch chromatography process, the MCSGP technique, for its 241 intrinsic features, allows to obtain the target product with high purity and high yield at the 242 same time. The main factor enabling an improved performance of MCSGP compared to that 243 of the batch process is the automatic internal recycling of the partially purified side 244 fractions. When working in batch chromatography, the side portions of the main peak, 245 containing both W (or S) and a remarkable amount of P, are discarded from the main 246 collection window but most of the time they are manually reprocessed into the system by 247 the operator, with risk of error and waste of time [41]. In twin-column MCSGP, on the 248 contrary, the recycle is accomplished automatically between the two columns, with no need 249 of intervention by the operator. The two identical columns work either in series 250 (interconnected mode) or in parallel (batch mode), depending on the position of the inlet 251 and outlet column valves [42,43]. When transferring a method from batch to continuous 252 chromatography, this method is performed on both the columns, but shifted of half a cycle 253 [22]. 254 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \u2022 Now that column-2 has been fully loaded, it can undergo the solvent gradient: W 272 impurities start eluting (zone 4); on the other side, column-1 is being stripped to remove 273 S and it is also equilibrated (zone 8). 274 275 At this point, the columns have switched position. When they exchange position again and 276 return to the initial configurations, a cycle is completed. Thus, one cycle is composed of two 277 switches. Generally, after few switches, the chromatographic system reaches the steady-278 state, which is demonstrated by the fact that that the UV profiles are completely 279 superimposable cycle after cycle. The reader should note that UV profiles are detected at the 280 outlet of the column, before the eluent stream is sent to the waste, to the fractionator or to 281 the other column. Under steady-state conditions, then, very close values of purity and 282 recovery are obtained for every collected pool. Therefore, after the steady state has been 283 reached, the number of cycles to be performed for the entire purification process depends 284 essentially on the amount of fresh feed that must be purified. In order to better understand 337 windows. Fig. 2 represents an ideal case where no product is wasted in zones 4 and 8, 338 however in other cases it is preferable to waste a small amount of very impure product in 339 these zones rather than risking the accumulation of impurities in the system during 340 recycling. Since the values of purity and recovery for each cycle are constant after the 341 steady state has been reached, in MCSGP one obtains a point and not a Pareto curve. If the 342 point of the MCSGP lies below the Pareto curve, the MCSGP process can be considered 343 unsuccessful, meaning that it reaches a lower recovery than the batch at the same purity. On 344 the opposite, if the point lies above the Pareto curve, this means that the recovery of 345 MCSGP has overcome that of the batch. From a practical viewpoint it must be said that 346 points on the top right corner of the graphic are an indication of a successful MCSGP. This 347 concept can be better visualized by looking at Fig. 5. This graphic shows from a purely 348 qualitative point of view a Pareto curve related to a batch chromatogram where the purest 349 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fraction (99% purity) corresponds to only 15% of recovery, whereas if yield were 100%, 350purity would decrease to 55%. If the MCSGP is unsuccessful, the set of switching times 351 must be changed. Particularly, it has been proven that the times t B and t E greatly influence 352 recovery. On the other side, the times t C and t D especially impact on purity since they define 353 the product elution window [26].The last parameter to consider when comparing purification processes is productivity. In 355 some cases, MCSGP gives similar results as that of the batch [25] or slightly lower [44], but 356 this is only partially a concerning point. Indeed, when dealing with very costly 357 biotherapeutics, it is preferable, from an economic viewpoint, to maximize the recovery of 358 the product rather than productivity of the process. Just to make an example, the cost of raw 359 glucagon is declared to be around some thousand dollars per gram [45]. It is evident that an 360 increase in recovery is reflected in a great economic advantage. Moreover, the typical 361 definition of productivity given in Eq. 3, usually considered when comparing the processes, 362 does not consider the economic advantage coming from the automatization of the process, 363 which is, instead, a very important point. 364 365 4.4. Applications of MCSGP 366The main field where MCSGP has been successfully applied is the purification of 367 biomolecules (such as protein, antibodies and peptides), where a wide variety of mobile and 368 stationary phases were tested.The interest towards antibodies, especially mAbs, as therapeutics is increasing, and thus 370 their demand. At the same time, mAbs are produced as a mixture of different isomers,which must be separated to ensure a good quality of the product and meet the market 372 specifications. The MCSGP process has been proven to be a successful method for this 373 scope and for this class of biomolecules [16, [46] [47][48].MCSGP process allowed to reach a higher yield and better productivity than the batch also 375 in the case of a mono-PEGylated protein, the \u03b1-Lactalbumin. The mixture of proteins with 376 different degrees of PEGylation was separated using anion exchange chromatography [17].Beside proteins, also mixtures of peptides have been purified through MCSGP process. The 378 very first cases of application of a 6-column or 3-column MCSGP to an industrial sample 379 were related to the separation of Calcitonin, a peptidic hormone made of 32 amino acids, 380 from its impurities [19,21,49]. Lately, some of the authors of this review have successfully Thanks to nonstop technological improvements, continuous, or semi-continuous (periodic), 403 countercurrent preparative liquid chromatography has nowadays reached the stage of mature 404 technology. These techniques are increasingly gaining importance from the industrial 405 viewpoint and they are considered a promising candidate that can revolutionize the 406 purification of biomolecule at a manufacturing level. The current increasing interest towards 407continuous purification processes is primarily driven by the improved quality, which 408 directly translate into drug safety and efficacy, of the final products in addition to economic 409 advantages, related to the high automation degree and improved yields. This is particularly 410 so when the goal is to maximize product-recovery rather than process-productivity, that is 411 the case of, e.g., highly molecularly active molecules. Many of today and tomorrow targeted continuous and integrated processes for the manufacturing of therapeutic proteins [64]. The 430 most important pharma regulatory Agencies look positively at these developments and are 431 active in the definition of Quality Aspects (QA) and ad-hoc regulatory actions for 432 continuous manufacturing [65,66]. The time is therefore ripe for change. 433 434 Acknowledgements 43",
    "body_text": "Since the 1980s, biopharmaceuticals have emerged as an innovative class of therapeutics, due to their highly specific activity, a feature that cannot be imitated by traditional drugs.[6]. They usually include nucleic acids, host cell proteins, lipids, components of the cell culture media, salts, etc. which derive from the manufacturing process. Very often, affinity into the column until its breakthrough. The product specifically binds to the stationary 74 phase, whereas all the other different species flow through the column and can be discarded.For instance, Staphylococcus Protein A-based stationary phase is largely employed for the chromatography leads to several advantages, especially increased recovery and better resin utilization, but this comes at the expense of the hardware complexity [23] .specifically designed for challenging separations where many product-related impurities are 105 present. Its operating principles will be discussed and its advantages over traditional single-106 column techniques will be presented. Method transfer from batch to continuous will be also 107 illustrated, together with a synthetic overview of most interesting applications of MCSGP.In doing this, an effort has been done to describe the process from the viewpoint of 109 analytical chemists (more than that of chemical engineers) in order to make the technology 110 more familiar to this community. Purity is the first parameter that is essential for pharmaceutical scopes. It is defined as the 117 ratio between the area of the product peak and the total area of the HPLC chromatogram:118 purity is calculated as the mean of the purities of the pools at the steady state. The outcome of the separation (i.e. resolution of the main peak from the impurities) has a 145 high impact on the performance of the whole process.As mentioned before, it frequently happens that batch purifications, especially when many 147 product-related impurities are present, are affected by a yield-purity trade-off. This situation is schematically represented in Fig. 1 . If the overlapping regions are completely discarded,An appealing possibility to overcome the limit of batch chromatography described above is to replace the single column process with a continuous (or semi-continuous) countercurrent chromatographic process, where the chromatographic system is continuously fed with the 165 crude mixture. To realize the continuous (or semi-continuous) mode, the instrument must be equipped with two or more (identical) columns connected through a series of valves. The The use of continuous chromatography operations has considerable advantages not only in 172 terms of recovery of the product (as it will be illustrated in the following) but also in terms 173 of automatization of the purification process.The interactions. For the sake of space, this technique will not be described in this paper, therefore the interested reader is addressed to other recent papers on the subject [6,23,30- \u2022 Zone 2: weakly adsorbing impurities (from now on called W), which are less retained 212 than the target product, start eluting from the column.\u2022 Zone 3: product (P) starts eluting from the column, but the weakly adsorbing impurities and thus it is discarded. At this stage, the columns are disconnected.\u2022 Then, valves switch position and the columns get interconnected. This means that W/P, 262 the overlapping region of W and P, is directly loaded from column-1 (zone 5) into column-2 (zone 1). Inline dilution is applied to ensure that W/P is re-adsorbed on 264 column-2.\u2022 The columns work again in batch mode and a window where product purity satisfies the 266 requirements imposed is recovered from column-1 (zone 6). At the same time, column-2is loaded with some fresh feed (zone 2).\u2022 After that, the columns get interconnected again to allow the recycling of P/S region from 269 column-1 (zone 7) into column-2 (zone 3). Inline dilution is applied to ensure that P/S is The characteristic times of the design batch chromatogram in Fig. 1 correspond to the 292 switching of the inlet and outlet valves of the columns in MCSGP (see Fig. 2 ), that regulates 293 the path accessible to the eluent stream. Fig. 3 shows in detail the path followed by the An important aspect to be considered is that the overlapping regions contain a higher 299 percentage of modifier than at the beginning of the gradient. Therefore, when they are recycled, they need to be diluted with an inline dilution stream, so that the product can be 301 adsorbed on the stationary phase. The fraction containing W/P is diluted to reach the 302 modifier concentration that can be found at t B , so that the product adsorbs on the stationary 303 phase while the weak impurities start moving along the column. The window containing P/S 304 is diluted to reach the percentage of organic modifier at the beginning of the gradient (t A ),because both the product and the strong impurities must be retained.The amount of fresh feed which is injected switch after switch (zone 2 of Fig. 2 ) is 307 calculated in order to maintain the mass of target compound constant into the system.Therefore, the mass of P to be loaded at every switch is the difference between the quantity 309 of target product loaded in the batch run and the amount of target product which is recycled 310 within the overlapping regions (zone 1 and 3).The first thing to do in order to transfer a batch method to MCSGP is to calculate a Pareto 314 curve reporting purity as a function of yield for the batch method (see Fig. 5 ). This is The first trial is usually done by choosing the values of t C and t D corresponding to a certain 335 hypothetical pool in which purity fulfills the requirements and recovery is sufficiently high. t B and t E must be set in order to minimize the amount of product eluting in the waste using a 2-column MCSGP equipment. In that case, the yield was 23% higher than the batch, purification strategy is that of oligonucleotides. This technique applied to a mixture of 386 oligonucleotides allowed to increase the mass recovered by 50% at a target purity of 92%[50].MCSGP can be applied also in the case of cannabinoids identification and purification. benefit also with respect to the economics of production [41] .potential to act as driver for the shift to precision medicine [52] .relies essentially on the well-known theory of nonlinear chromatography, robust, validated Although, as seen above, MCSGP can be applied very conveniently down-stream to batch 428 or fed-batch bioreactors, we believe that it will play a major role also in the establishment ofThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.",
