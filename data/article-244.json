            "text": "In situ physico-chemical disinfection of high risk faecal waste is both effective and widely used as a sanitation management strategy for infection prevention and control. Systematic tests where the performance of alternative physico-chemical disinfection methods is systematically compared and optimized must be based on reliable protocols. These protocol are currently not adequately addressing the neutralization related issues: the neutralization of the tested disinfectant after specified conditions of concentration and contact time (CT) is necessary to prevent continued disinfection after the intended contact time; moreover such neutralization is often necessary in practice and on a large scale to prevent adverse health and ecological impacts from remaining disinfectant after the target CT is achieved. Few studies adequately assess the extent of neutralization of the chemical disinfectant and are intended to optimize on-site disinfection practices for waste matrices posing high microbial risks. Hence, there is a need for effective and reproducible neutralization protocols in chemical disinfection trials and practice. Furthermore, for most of chemical disinfectants used in healthcare settings there is no practical methodology to reliably and conveniently measure the residual disinfectant concentration after its neutralization and also determine the optimum concentration of the neutralizer. Because some neutralizing compounds can themselves be toxic to the test microorganisms, it is necessary to optimize neutralization procedures in disinfection experiments for the development of infection control practices using accepted positive control microbes. In the presented work, a stepwise bioassay-based protocol using representative faecal indicator microbes is described for optimizing chemical disinfection and subsequent disinfectant neutralization of any infectious faecal waste matrix. The example described is for the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride and its recommended chemical neutralizer in a high strength human faecal waste matrix."

            "text": "The operation of health care facilities in emergency (e.g. natural disaster or population displacement) settings as well as under routine conditions where patients are excreting highly infectious bacterial or viral pathogens is known to result in the production of pathogen-laden human excreta. If insufficiently treated, this infectious waste may provide pathways for the further transmission of infectious water-and faecal-borne diseases. In the US and many other high-income countries with presumably adequate treatment facilities, human faecal waste and other potentially infectious bodily fluids from healthcare facilities can be discharged directly into local sewage systems. In situ pre-treatment of such human waste is sometimes encouraged under certain conditions such the introduction of high risk diseases and their pathogens into the population, such as cholera (Ashbolt, 2004) (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2010), typhoid fever (Murphy et al., 2017) , Ebola (CDC, 2014a; and infectious hepatitis (Craun et al., 2010) (Sehulster et al., 2003) (Spina et al., 2017) . The World Health Organization (WHO), has https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.07.002 Received 7 February 2018; Received in revised form 28 June 2018; Accepted 3 July 2018 recommendations for management of such wastes using a disinfection option (Pr\u00fcss et al., 1999; WHO, 2014; WHO and Unicef, 2014) . However, the efficacy of existing protocols for in situ inactivation of pathogens in human faecal waste by physico-chemical disinfection processes is uncertain, especially in raw faecal matter and high strength wastewater (Bibby et al., 2015 Schuit et al., 2016; Tondera et al., 2015 Tondera et al., , 2016 . Chemical agents such as chlorine bleach (Tree et al., 2003) , hydrated lime, peracetic acid (Allievi et al., 1994; Kitis, 2004) , alcohol (Springthorpe et al., 1986; Tung et al., 2013) , phenolic substances (Abad et al., 1997; Mbithi et al., 1990) , anionic detergents (Gerba and Kennedy, 2007) , and quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride (BNZ) (Tarbox et al., 1998) and cetylpyridinium chloride (Russell, 1999) , are the main disinfectants currently used in health care settings. However, the suitability and effectiveness of these compounds for disinfecting complex matrices with high organic content has not been adequately demonstrated and use parameters have not been developed based on experimental evidence. Some of the abovementioned outbreaks of highly contagious diseases have been associated with insufficiently treated sewage: such outbreaks indicate that improved and better documented methods are needed to ensure the effectiveness of chemical disinfection protocols for infectious faecal wastes and sewage."

Such chemical neutralization of disinfectant chemicals in disinfection experiments is standard practice to allow for reliable culture based assays of faecal indicator bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis (APHA, 2010a; c)) as bacterial pathogen surrogates, bacteriophages such as somatic coliphages (APHA, 2010d; Gall et al., 2016) , FRNA phages (Shahrampour et al., 2015) , Bacteroides phages (Ebdon et al., 2012) , and bacteriophage \u03c66 (Casanova and Weaver, 2015b) (Casanova and Weaver, 2015a) as virus pathogen surrogates in complex sewage and faecal waste matrices. Failure to achieve adequate chemical neutralization of the disinfectant used in an experiment can result in flawed disinfection kinetics estimates based on CT conditions because inactivation could continue after the experiment is completed due to variable and unknown remaining concentrations of the disinfectant or its biocidal by-products. Such overestimation may result in flawed disinfection protocols that produce inaccurate disinfection kinetics. Most studies investigating the antimicrobial properties of chemicals that have been published in recent years do not address the quantitative neutralization of the disinfecting agent (Kingsley et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2012; Zanetti et al., 1996) ."

However, for some chemical disinfectants there is no simple and standard methodology to measure its residual concentration. After attempted neutralization, residual disinfectant may be present at low concentrations and be active, unless the chemical agents or its antimicrobial effects are shown to be absent. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably assess neutralization efficacy of the disinfectant and determine the minimum required amount of neutralizer to assure absence of the disinfectant at the end of the specified contact time (T). For those chemical disinfectants whose concentrations are difficult and impractical to measure in the waste matrix, a microbial bioassay-based approach to determining their chemical neutralization in a complex waste matrix is proposed in the presented work."

The presented work aims to provide a reliable but simple method to determine if a chemical disinfectant in a complex faecal matrix is neutralized adequately by using a bioassay procedure that documents the culturability of target microbes. The described protocol aims to ensure that adequate neutralization of the disinfectant is achieved, so that it does not interfere with subsequent culture-based microbial analysis of the processed sample. The use of bacterial and viral indicator organisms spiked into pasteurized or autoclaved wastewater is preferred to the use of naturally occurring organisms in waste matrix samples for two reasons. First, the use of non-pathogenic indicators protects the health and safety of laboratory researchers. Second, the use of culturable indicator organisms enables high initial titers to be used, simplifying the process of quantifying disinfection performance and subsequent chemical neutralization of the disinfectant, based on quantifiable microbial levels (i.e. counts higher, therefore statistically more significant and ultimately more accurate)."

The establishment of a practical, simple and adaptable protocol, for reliable chemical neutralization of disinfectants used in in-situ waste disinfection applications was the main objective of this work. In the presented work, a bioassay approach utilizing both bacteria and bacteriophages was applied to the specific case of the quaternary ammonium disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BNZ) as an example disinfectant for in-situ treatment of health care associated faecal waste.

These three studies cite ASTM E 1054-Section 9 to validate the use of a mixture of Tween 80 \u00ae and lecithin (ASTM, 2013). Junka et al. (2014) used a mixture of 10% Tween 80 \u00ae , 3% soybean lecithin, and 0.5% sodium thiosulfate as the neutralizer. Most of the available BNZ disinfection literature does not provide precise levels of the ratios of Tween 80 \u00ae / lecithin and/or other neutralizing chemicals nor do the studies include detailed information on the ratio of neutralization mixture to the disinfection agent. Most do not investigate the efficacy of neutralization in complex matrices such as simulated faecal waste samples. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first attempt to design a standardized approach to measure residual BNZ using a microbial bioassay after attempted chemical neutralization. Furthermore, the bioassay described here represents an improvement if compared to the abovementioned studies, as it presents the advantage of addressing the issue of potential microbial inactivation by neutralizers."

Here a brief explanation of the rationale of our final choice. Recent years have shown emerging numbers of outbreaks associated with enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus (Baize et al., 2014) , Coronaviruses such as SARS (Hsieh et al., 2004) or viruses associated with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Haagmans et al., 2014) . Their high persistence towards disinfection methods coupled with their low infectious dose and high numbers of infectious viruses excreted with human waste lead required biosafety facilities of levels 3 or 4 to safely handle them. Therefore, enveloped bacteriophages \u03c66 (Vidaver et al., 1973) are currently discussed as suitable surrogates due to several of their advantageous characteristics such as the non-human pathogenic nature of both \u03c66 and P. syringae, their bacterial host (Wei et al., 2009 ) which allows their handling under bio safety level 1 (equivalent to minimal containment) (Gallandat and Lantagne, 2017) . In addition, \u03c66 is easily cultivated, can be analysed rapidly using established culture techniques such as plaque assays and iscompared to other enveloped bacteriophages of the family Cystoviridae (Mindich et al., 1999) well described and characterized in literature (Laurinavicius et al., 2004) . Still, a recent study by de Carvalho et al. (2017) indicates that even though \u03c66 shows behavioural similarities to enveloped enteric viruses of the highest public health relevance, certain limitations in regards of their persistence towards temperature and their decay rate in deionized and natural waters exist."

Therefore, a highly microbially contaminated \"High-Risk Human Faecal Waste (HRHW)\" matrix was created by mixing 3 parts hospital sewage (UNC Hospital, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) and 1 part donated raw human faeces (Vol/Vol). This matrix was then used as a \"worst case\" sample to be disinfected with BNZ. The faecal samples used were collected in sealable collection containers from volunteers working at the UNC environmental virology laboratories and either processed immediately or stored at 4\u00b0C for no longer than four weeks to ensure comparability. Hospital sewage was collected from three sampling sites (manholes) at UNC Hospitals and equal volumes, one from each sampling site, were combined to form a composite sample.

The goal was to reduce the proportion of any component that causes problems such as creating unnecessary foaming or is more expensive.

The relative extent of neutralization was readily discernible by visual comparison of neutralized samples containing the chemical disinfectant BNZ to positive control samples that contained no disinfectant but were also neutralized. Microbial growth or viral infectivity was not precisely quantified, especially when high numbers of colonies or plaques were observed. The semi-quantitative classification of assay plates based on the observable extent of microbial growth/inhibition in the neutralized control plates and neutralized disinfected plates is shown in Table 1 . Assessment was performed by comparing each plate representing the neutralized sample to an equivalent control (bacterial or viral) plate on which a replicate aliquot of the same bacterial (or viral) suspension at the same titer was inoculated on the same type of agar, but to which no disinfectant was added and therefore, giving optimal bacterial or viral growth. The incubated plates were then compared, and the results scored using the operational definitions described in Table 1 . After obtaining confirmatory results for two sets of trials using bacterial indicators, \u03c66 as a viral indicator was introduced to confirm these results. The indicator virus was chosen due to its structural and behavioural similarities to high risk enveloped viruses such as Ebolavirus and Avian influenza virus, and was prepared as described by Casanova and Weaver (2015a) . After the neutralizer was added to the disinfectant and the virus stock was spiked into the mixture, the sample was plated using the double agar layer (DAL) method modified from US EPA Method 1602 (EPA, 2001) . The same negative control tests were performed as explained above for the bacterial indicator."

Recent studies on best practice to perform rapid in situ chemical disinfection of human sewage and faecal wastes in healthcare settings have utilized different established and routinely used disinfectants such as chlorine bleach, hydrated lime, alcohol or phenol-based substances, anionic detergents and quaternary ammonium compounds, such as BNZ and cetylpyridinium chloride, under different use conditions of exposure time and disinfectant concentrations in varied waste matrices. The main aim of this study was to define Table 4 Efficacy of chemical neutralization of faecal waste samples disinfected with 0.2-3% BNZ based on E. coli growth with different Neutralizer/Disinfectant ratios and different neutralizer concentrations. Trials performed using 20:80 mixture of Tween 80 \u00ae /Lecithin. (0) indicates no bacterial growth, (1-10 3 , > 10 3 and \u00bb10 3 ) indicates different levels of bacterial growth (see Table 1 ).

The ratio is defined as (vol/vol). an adaptable, effective and scalable protocol for the chemical neutralization of any candidate chemical disinfectant when testing and optimizing its performance efficacy in high strength human faecal waste matrices using a microbial bioassay system in the absence of a reliable and available method to analyse disinfectant residual after attempted chemical neutralization (see Table 7 ). Initial experiments performed in PBS documented the use conditions for successful neutralization of the disinfectant BNZ using a bacterial bioassay. Growth of the bioassay bacterium E. coli confirmed effective neutralization, which could be quantified visually when using 50:50 v/v and 80/20 v/v neutralization mixtures at volume concentrations of 1%-4%, for both low (0.2%) and high (2.0%) concentrations of BNZ. The results are consistent with those of previous studies in different waste matrices and contexts of health care facilities (Gainor et al., 1997; Msellati et al., 1999; Tarbox et al., 1998) . Subsequent experiments showed that, at greater neutralizer concentration, bacterial (or viral) growth increased. Bacteria growth and the formation of plaques on a lawn of host bacteria in the case of bacteriophage \u03c66 were benchmarked for efficacy in the experimental setup in the absence of active disinfectant as a control, with expected results. Negative controls, which included either 1) no disinfectant and no neutralizer or 2) only neutralizer without added disinfectant, confirmed bacterial growth in both conditions and showed that the bioassay was performing as expected in absence of disinfection and neutralization. As expected, the neutralizers had no adverse effect on bacterial or viral growth. Disinfectant positive controls, containing BNZ plus the indicator bacteria or viruses, showed no microbial growth as was expected."

Using a 20:80 v/v neutralization mixture resulted in bacterial growth comparable to using a 50:50 v/v mixture and allowed for better mixing without foaming. Both the 10:90 v/v and the 5:95 v/v neutralizer-mixes with lower Tween 80 \u00ae percentage led to inconclusive results. Therefore, a minimum concentration of 20% Tween 80 \u00ae is recommended and considered optimal for neutralizing the disinfecting agent BNZ."

Chemical neutralization in the faecal waste sample and in PBS further documented that higher amounts of neutralization mixture did not adversely impact the growth of either bacteria or the infectivity of the bacteriophages used as bioassay microbes. To our knowledge, the presented work constitutes the first study which successfully establishes and reproducibly tests a practical, flexible and easily scalable methodology and bioassay-based stepwise protocol to evaluate and use during in-situ chemical disinfection studies of waste matrices. While BNZ was the disinfectant used in this study, the results suggest a broad adaptability to other chemical disinfectants for which measuring chemical concentrations may be difficult."

However, these publications do not adequately address current situations where there is a need to assess the efficacy of disinfection and sterilizations assays for a broad variety of pathogenic microorganisms in high strength complex faecal waste matrices with high concentrations of oxidizable constituents and high risk persistent and emerging pathogens such as enveloped viruses. This protocol attempts to serve as a general methodology to be applied for chemical neutralization disinfectant chemicals in studies investigating disinfection of highly oxidizable human faecal waste and other liquid samples in many contexts of health care or emergency response settings. To our knowledge the approach and methods presented here are the first standardized protocol that address the chemical disinfection and the neutralization of the faecal waste matrices that are the focus of this research (so called 'worst case' matrices). The protocols that are currently available for disinfection testing of healthcare biocides are not adequately representative of the kinds of human waste samples and conditions addressed by this study. This highly adaptable protocol enabled an accurate assessment of neutralization of disinfectant at any given disinfectant concentration and contact time. The adaptive nature of the protocol could be used to determine the optimal chemical neutralization procedure of a disinfectant applied to any given faecal waste or other highly organic liquid waste matrix to be disinfected for public health protection (Manasfi et al., 2017; Schaefer et al., 2017; Ufermann et al., 2011) ."

Negative controls 1, 2 and 3 (see Table 3 ) were used to ensure: 1) that the test microbe was performing as expected; and 2) that the relatively high amounts of neutralization mixture used did not compromise the results by affecting the survival of the spiked microbial strain. This included condition 1) of no BNZ with no neutralizer, and condition 2) of one sample with no BNZ and neutralizer only. As expected, the spiked bacteria were able to grow on the first set of negative control (1) plates. When using the second negative control with only neutralizer (no. 2), normal bacterial and viral growth was seen, ensuring no harmful effect of the neutralizer on the bacterial and viral stock."

The rationale behind this choice was since a 0.2% BNZ concentration is typically used in microbiology laboratories as a disinfectant. Due to the highly organic nature of the conservative faecal waste matrix used in the experiments, it was decided to start the experiment with the typical 0.2% BNZ concentration and then increase the concentration by a 10-fold factor to 20% maximum. A higher than 20% concentration of BNZ could not be realistically applied in hospital settings and elsewhere, because BNZ may potentially present risk of mutagenicity effects and developmental toxicity, if used improperly at very high concentrations. Moreover, the use of more concentrated and even non-diluted BNZ may also make it hazardous if there are risks of skin contact, ingestion, eye contact and inhalation (ScienceLab, 2017) ."

Therefore, different proportions of the Tween 80 \u00ae /lecithin neutralizer were tested to find the effective concentrations and optimum combinations that allowed for successful bacteria growth. Finally, the set of experiments performed with the preferred 20:80 Tween 80 \u00ae /lecithin proportion, along with a longer neutralization time before plating (2 min) and more thorough mixing (mixing for 2 min by hand and by vortexing) proved to be effective by giving good disinfectant neutralization and successful bacteria growth result at the lowest usable ratio between neutralizer and disinfectant."
