            "text": "Background. Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China. As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus , which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method. By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013) , we use R 0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results. The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R 0t ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R 0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R 0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R 0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R 0t . Conclusion. The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R 0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19."

As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,171 patients have been diagnosed with NCP in China; 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by COVID-19 now, and a total of 399,487 close contacts were traced [3] , which puts forward a great challenge for the public health and clinical treatments in China. Until now, the epidemic of COVID-19 still shows a high number of new confirmed cases and suspected infections per day. Thus, estimating the change of transmissibility of COVID-19 may quantitatively assess the severity of outbreak and provide evidence for more effective public health decisions based on empirical data, which can maximally control the outbreak of NCP and reduce socioeconomic losses."

            "text": "One of the most important parameters in epidemiological dynamics is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection [4] . Thus, the basic reproduction number can represent the transmissibility of an infectious disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there are many researchers who established some mathematical models to estimate the basic reproduction number R 0 of COVID-19. For example, Imai et al. [5] estimated an averaged R 0 of 2.6 with an uncertainty range 1.5-3.5 up to 18th January 2020, based on an analysis combining their past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories, and predicted that the control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. On the basis of the information of 425 patients with confirmed NCP, Li et al. [1] estimated the basic reproduction number to be 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9). Tang et al. [6] obtained the estimation results based on the likelihood and model analysis, which reveal that the basic reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI: 5.71-7.23). Accounting for the impact of variations in disease reporting rate, Zhao et al. [7] estimated that the mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95% CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with an 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. Exponential growth (EG) and maximum likelihood estimation (ML) were applied to estimate the reproductive number of 2.92 (95% CI: 2.32-3.63) [8] . Sheng et al. [9] estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 to be 4.71 (95% CI: 4.50-4.92) based on the dynamical model, and the effective reproduction number has dropped to 2.08 (1.99-2.18) as of Jan. 22, 2020. More related results [10, 11] with respect to the R 0 of COVID-19 recently are displayed in a summary forest plot (see Figure1 for more details)."

The implementation of these control strategies depends on the public's response, such as raising public health awareness, and on Jan. 23, 2020, Wuhan was locked down, which restricted the persons in Wuhan outflow from the epicenter area. These strategies may be related to the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and how to quantitatively measure the effect of public awareness and the Wuhan lockdown strategy on the transmissibility change of COVID-19 is one of the key issues. As far as we know, there are rare results with respect to this. Therefore, to assess the transmission pattern of COVID-19 and potential factors, in this paper, we estimated the transmissibility of COVID-19 recently and explored the relationship between instantaneous basic reproduction number (R 0t ), public awareness, and the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy."

To avoid spurious regression, we also performed the Granger causality test (GCT) [17, 18] to analyze the causality between the transmissibility change and BDI (or BMS). The order of GCTs was determined by the partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). GCT can often be used to examine the possible causal relationship between two time series, that is, the past behavior of one sequence may affect the current behavior of the other. The GCTs are significant, which means that there may be a causal relationship between public health awareness, the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t of COVID-19. Analysis of GCT was performed with the use of STATA with the package \"gcause,\" and other analyses were performed with the use of the MATLAB software (MathWorks, Version 2012a) and R software (R Project for Statistical Computing, Version 3.6.2)."

With the increase of cumulative information, the public health awareness increases gradually, which may be conducive to implement prevention and control policies. Furthermore, we find that the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in decreasing the transmissibility of COVID-19. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers R 0t reach the maximum on Jan. 27, 2020, and then a sustained decline (see Figure 1(a) ).

In addition, Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients among these three time series are estimated in Table 2 . These results indicate that the Baidu Index of \"novel coronavirus\" can be selected to measure the public awareness with respect to COVID-19.
