Design: A prospective follow-up study. Setting: In 2019, the baseline Urban Health and Nutrition Study 2019 (UHNS-2019) was conducted in 603 households, which were selected randomly from 30 clusters to represent underserved urban settlements in Colombo. In the present study, 35 % of households from the UHNS-2019 cohort were randomly selected for repeat interviews, 1 year after the baseline study and 6 months after COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Height/length and weight of children and women were re-measured, household food insecurity was reassessed, and associated factors were gathered through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Differences in measurements at baseline and follow-up studies were compared. Participants: A total of 207 households, comprising 127 women and 109 children were included. Results: The current prevalence of children with wasting and overweight was higher in the follow-up study than at baseline UHNS-2019 (18\u00b73 % v. 13\u00b77 %; P = 0\u00b726 and 8\u00b73 % v. 3\u00b77 %; P = 0\u00b712, respectively). There was a decrease in prevalence of child stunting (14\u00b77 % v. 11\u00b79 %; P = 0\u00b737). A change was not observed in overall obesity in women, which was about 30\u00b77 %. Repeated lockdown was associated with a significant reduction in food security from 57 % in UHNS-2019 to 30 % in the current study (P < 0\u00b7001). Conclusions: There was an increase in wasting and overweight among children while women had a persistent high prevalence of obesity. This population needs suitable interventions to improve nutrition status of children and women to minimise susceptibility to COVID-19.",

People in USS were confined to the limited living spaces in their houses with no access to physical activity. Implementation of lockdown regulations were monitored by the police. The government implemented cash transfer and food distribution programmes targeting households below the poverty line. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was successfully controlled.

It was observed that the prevalence of child wasting, stunting and overweight was comparable to national rates. However, the prevalence of food insecurity and obesity in women was higher than the national averages (8) . Restrictions on movement and activity to control the spread of the pandemic have severely affected the livelihood of the underserved urban settlement population. This has resulted in food insecurity and increased vulnerability to malnutrition.

Child wasting is an acute transient condition amenable to treatment with appropriate nutrition and medical interventions. Child stunting is chronic in nature and needs to be prevented (17) . The prevalence of concurrent WaSt among children under 5 years of age is an important indicator in child survival (18) . All three indicators are important in an emergency situation. Studies on this topic related to COVID-19 pandemic are limited, but a few available studies in other countries depict weight gain or no shift in weight (19) . Child wasting, stunting and concurrent WaSt provide wide range of information related to disruption of livelihood in this population due to COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a good example to show how marginalised populations will get affected further. As children are most vulnerable among low-income groups, focusing on child nutrition is needed in this type of population to prevent child malnutrition becoming a public health problem. We must consider these vulnerable groups while adopting universal COVID-19 prevention strategies overall.",

When the playgrounds in the neighbourhood were closed off and they were mandated to stay at home continuously for 52 d by the lockdown, children were more susceptible for weight gain. The closure of preschools which extended even beyond the lockdown period resulted in the absence of organised physical activity sessions for the young children. Furthermore, increased screen time that is also associated with increase in snacking, especially most available convenient food like sugary biscuits may be another contributory factor for the increase in overweight. Consistent findings have been reported in other countries (23, 24) . However, a change in obesity was not observed in women during the past year. This may become aggravated due to restrictions imposed on movement and changes in dietary habits due to economic hardships until solution is available for the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "Similar to other studies, our study suggests that severe wasting in children can lead to stunting (18) . Furthermore, two-thirds of severely wasted children in the past year remain wasted indicating the importance of revisiting existing intervention programmes. However, it should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm it. Concurrent WaSt deserves more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic because of its impact on child survival (18) . This study indicates that presence of severe stunting and severe wasting in the past are good indicators to identify high-risk children for concurrent WaSt if these children have not attended routine growth monitoring clinics due to lockdown. The lack of a significant association between household food insecurity and child malnutrition in our study implies that merely improving household food security may not be sufficient to improve the nutritional status of children in this population. Therefore prevention, early detection and appropriate treatments are needed for children with wasting, stunting and concurrent WaSt to minimise their susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection. This is the first follow-up study in Sri Lanka to assess the impact of COVID-19 on nutrition status and food security in USS. The main strength of this study revolves around repeated measurements of same households and individuals by the same research team. However, the small sample size is a limitation as we had to minimal interactions with households due to social restrictions imposed during the pandemic. Access and coverage of nutrition services were not assessed in this study. Since this was a rapid assessment with short contact time with the study participants, we did not collect information on any food assistance received and access and coverage of nutrition services which could have better explained the findings.",

There is an urgent need to focus on morbidly obese women to minimise their susceptibility to COVID-19 and to control unhealthy weight gain of women to prevent further increase in obesity. This population needs to be monitored for food security on a long-term basis as repeated lockdowns may worsen the outcome. ",
