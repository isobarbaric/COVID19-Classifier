In most cases, the infection date can only be assigned to a time interval of more than one day. Therefore, the actual incubation period falls between IPl i and IPu i , i = 1, ..., N , where IPl i and IPu i set the lower and upper bounds for the incubation period of case i, respectively. The raw statistics of the three datasets is shown in Main Text Figure 2a . This is done by simply assign equal weight to the possible values within the reported window [IPl i , IPu i ] for each of the patients. The nominal probability distribution of the incubation period from each dataset (or the aggregated one) is then obtained by taking a simple average over all the cases within the set. Although there is general consistency with regard to the overall shape of the distributions obtained, there are also significant deviations particularly outside the peak region. While part of the variations can be attributed to statistical fluctuations when the sample size is limited, it is also plausible that systematic bias exists under the equal probability assumption when dealing with uncertainties related to finite exposure windows.",

Keeping potential shortcomings of this type in mind, we present below quantification of our model using the data provided by He et al. [12] The dataset contains 74 infector-infectee pairs. Among them, 66 pairs have a unique symptom onset date (see Source Data). They are used in our analysis. As illustrated in Supplementary Figure Below, we quantify the statistics of disease transmission time with a probability density function p I (\u03b8, t), with t measured from the symptom onset of the infector, and \u03b8 the set of parameters to be determined.

Assuming statistical independence between the latter two in the clinical samples collected, we may write the serial interval distribution as a convolutional integral, Table I in the Main Text. As noted in earlier studies [11, 13] , the empirical serial interval distributions can be skewed by shifts in the transmission window of the index patients surveyed. For example, travel delays move the effective p I (\u2206t) in the positive direction, while isolation of symptomatic patients move the effective p I (\u2206t) in the negative direction.

This can be done by numerically evaluating the expressions presented in Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the probability q L (t) for the latent phase and the corresponding exit rate \u03b1 L (t). Good agreement is seen for q L (t) under the two parametrisation schemes adopted. The curves for \u03b1 L (t) = \u2212q L (t)/q L (t) also exhibit the same trend, although discrepancies exist in the actual shape. On the first day since infection, the transition rate to the infectious phase is low which explains the low value of \u03b1 L (t) in this period. This is followed by an accelerated transition rate and a faster than exponential decay of q L (t), reaching a peak value of 0.6 day \u22121 or above.

The parameter R E , which sets the overall scale of transmission, incorporates total contribution from both presymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (Main Text Figure 1 ). The shift parameter \u03b8 S , on the other hand, depends on how fast transmission decays on the symptomatic side. As seen from Eq. (S37), a small decay rate \u03b1 B may change \u03b8 S into the negative. Using the parameter values determined from Sec. 2, we obtain \u03b8 S \u22120.15 day. In this case, the peakshift of the infectiousness curve to the pre-symptomatic side is compensated by transmission from symptomatic patients. As reported in Ref. [13] , the latter could vary over time depending on the isolation measures applied to symptomatic patients.",

However, when the number of cases is small, growth tends to be affected by chance events (e.g., super-spreaders) and also by family cases where the transmission pattern can be quite different from that of typical social contacts. Furthermore, it may be dominated by imported cases which do not reflect much of the spreading characteristics in the local community.

Supplementary Figure 2: Temporal events in a pairwise disease transmission. The index patient i transmits the virus to infectee j within an exposure window measured from the symptom onset of patient i. The two symptom onsets are indicated by black bars along the time axis, while the actual transmission event is indicated by the red bar. t SI is the serial interval, t O,j is the incubation period of infectee j. \u2206t is the time difference between the transmission event and the symptom onset of infector i, which can be either negative (pre-symptomatic transmission) or positive (post-symptomatic transmission). Wl i and Wu i are the left and right bounds of the exposure window, w.r.t the symptom onset of infector i.",
