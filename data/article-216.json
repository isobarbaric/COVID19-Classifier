It allows to write the size of the minimal automaton recognizing the output as a function of the sizes of the minimal automata recognizing the inputs. The topic dates back to the 70s, from the seminal paper of Maslov [14] describing, explicitly but without any proof, the state complexities of several operations. Since the 90s, this area of research became very active and the state complexity of numerous operations has been computed. See, for example, [6, [11] [12] [13] 15] and [8] for a survey of the subject."

            "text": "However, a few general methods are commonly used in order to compute state complexities. The most common method consists in providing a witness, which is a specific example reaching what is proven to be an upper bound. The witness itself is, in general, found by trial and error, sometimes using a witness that worked for a number of other operations and modifying it to fit the specific needs of the operation considered. In many cases, for example [1, 7] or [4] , the witness is constructed by considering, explicitly or implicitly, the whole monoid of the transformations acting on the states of the minimal automata recognizing the input languages. This method has been theorized in two independently written papers [2, 5] . More precisely, the approach consists, on the one hand, in describing states as combinatorial objects and finding upper bounds using combinatorial tools, and, on the other hand, in building a huge witness, called a monster, chosen in a set of automata having as many transition functions as possible. This method can be applied to obtain the state complexity to the wide range of 1-uniform operations that are associated to operators, called modifiers, that act on automata to produce an automaton in a certain restrictive way. In this paper, we examine the regular operations described by the class of some very simple modifiers called product modifiers. These modifiers are characterized by the fact that they build the Cartesian product automaton with the transitions took from the input automata. We investigate many properties of this class and in particular we completely describe the set of the regular operations that can be encoded by product modifiers. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives definitions and notations about automata. In Sect. 3, we partially recall the monster approach. Finally, in Sect. 4, we define product modifiers and characterize the regular operations they encode in Sect. 5."
