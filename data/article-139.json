            "text": "The integration of sustainability and resilience in supply chain design and management represents one of the essential and recently introduced paradigms (Ivanov 2018a). Literature and practice have shown the joint occurrence of the two important concepts of sustainability and resilience (Roostaie et al. 2019a) . Supply chain sustainability is defined as maintaining business continuity in order to reduce long-term business risks (Ivanov et al. 2017; Ivanov 2018b Ivanov , 2018a ; while supply chain resilience is \"the ability of a system to return to its original state or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed\" (Christopher and Peck 2004) . Both concepts are multi-dimensional and correlated (Roostaie et al. 2019b; Balugani et al. 2020) with several intersections between them (Ivanov 2018b) and play a key role in strategic decision-making (Ardebili and Padoano 2020) . Supply chain sustainability and resilience have recently attracted researchers' interest due to the significant increase in supply chains' complexity (Ramezankhani et al. 2018; Ivanov and Dolgui 2019) . Globalization, outsourcing, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) led to supply chain developments to be extended, interconnected, more complex, and thus more vulnerable to disruptive events (Thomas et al. 2016; Behzadi et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2019; Vishnu et al. 2019) . Furthermore, the growing concern about sustainability has led to organizations and supply chains considering management of sustainability-related supply chain risks, which focus on the effect of risks on the ecosystem, corporate reputation, and compliance with laws (Giannakis and Papadopoulos 2016) .",

Business continuity has been severely disrupted, and all areas of the economy and society have been immensely affected, raising a series of completely novel decision-making settings for supply chain researchers and practitioners (Ivanov 2020a) . Realizing the negative impacts of disruptions, companies more than ever, attempt to create and be part of more resilient supply chains (Christopher and Peck 2004; Jabbarzadeh et al. 2018) .

First, it develops a decision-making framework for production systems management within supply chains integrating sustainability and resilience dimensions to cope with traditional and sustainability-related risks during low-frequency-high-impact events as pandemics. Second, it introduces an operationalization scheme of a sustainable and resilient production system illustrated via a case study during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

For an environmentally sustainable manufacturer avoiding toxic materials, the effect of profit loss due to chemical spill is potentially minor. A company that provides quality occupational safety and healthcare for its employees (social responsibility) has better potential to overcome losses in the workforce due to a disease outbreak. Hence, to analyze supply chain sustainability, it is necessary to address the effect of sustainability initiatives on system resilience (Fahimnia and Jabbarzadeh 2016) .

Although resilience and sustainability are considered strictly correlated, their relationship may be complex and may vary according to the context due to the multidimensionality of the two concepts, different definitions, and fields of applicability (Balugani et al. 2020) . Hence, a supply chain being resilient does not mean it is sustainable. Zavala-Alc\u00edvar et al. (2020) highlighted different examples where resilient practices have different impacts on the sustainability of supply chains. For instance, redundancies required to deal with disruptions increase resource consumption and inventory use, which affect a fundamental principle of sustainability, namely the efficient use of available resources in the supply chain. On the other hand, maintaining redundancies in the supply chain implies having geographically dispersed suppliers and flexible supply policies to ensure continuity of operations, positively affecting the social dimension of sustainability.",

The broader impact of sustainability interventions on the supply chain overall resilience has remained unexplored (Fahimnia and Jabbarzadeh 2016) . The literature lacks frameworks developed based on industry collaboration (Thomas et al. 2016 ) and lacks conceptual frameworks for integrating sustainability and resilience (Roostaie et al. 2019b (Roostaie et al. , 2019a Zavala-Alc\u00edvar et al. 2020) .

Risk monitoring is achieved by identifying any occurrence of COVID-19 cases to check the plan's implementation while practicing tier compliance (the Check step). A detailed plan for identifying and tracing potentially infected personnel is set, as illustrated in the following section. Based on the outcome of the Check step of the PDCA cycle, if a plant shutdown is mandated, the Act step involves following the pre-developed shutdown plan. The plan entails conforming to all procedures required by local and regional authorities, the disinfection of the affected workplaces, and plant restart preparation. The Act step also verifies the completion of all action items and gives feedback to the Plan step to close the PDCA cycle by reporting internal conditions of the production system and problems faced while practicing the operational practices given in the tier system.

Analyzing the different decisions has led to the following observations. Although flexibility and responsiveness were usually chased, the practices adopted during the pandemic followed traditional management tools commonly considered as less flexible to ensure operational effectiveness and continuity during the pandemic. The supply chain of the studied case was transformed from a pull (reactive/demand-based) to a push (proactive/supply-based) system to adapt to the changes in the market, demand, and consumer patterns initiated by the pandemic and to be able to respond efficiently to the emerging disruptions and uncertainties. This has affected tactical decisions such as demand, production, inventory planning, and operational decisions such as shop floor operations, quality control, and health and safety planning. Table 1 presents the main changes in the tactical and operational decisions introduced to mitigate risks during the pandemic. The former or usual policy that has been followed before the outbreak of the pandemic is indicated, along with the new shift in decisions. The table further states the drivers behind each decision along with the measures that reflect the introduced change. Finally, based on a discussion with the principal informant, subjective potential impacts on both sustainability and resilience pillars are presented in Table 1 . It is worth noting that the pillars of sustainability and resilience that have been illustrated in Table 1 are the ones that are potentially most directly affected by each decision made.

Traditionally, responsive production systems and supply chains are expected to provide various SKUs with multiple changeovers. On the contrary, during the pandemic, the high utilization of the available production time is essential, and thus changeovers need to be minimized. This practice can mitigate the impact of possible supply disruptions and is reflected in the percentage of the changeover loss in the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) loss tree.

Keeping higher levels of raw and packaging materials inventory can avoid production system stoppage during a supply disruption. Increasing finished goods stocks among the supply chain and in the market through distributors and retailers can mitigate the negative impact of disruptions during the pandemic.

Zoning means splitting the entire production system into zones, assigning each employee to a specific zone, limiting movements across zones only to the necessary ones, and maintaining records of both assignments and movements daily. The zoning approach can help the management to track and trace contacts of any suspicious COVID-19 case. However, this required a change in manning per line operations.

A computer vision program has been used to monitor and control the recommended minimum social distance between employees in different areas of the production system (e.g., canteen). Although digital solutions were used for access control, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), new and more advanced digital solutions have been used, such as computer vision. A digital access control device has been installed at the site entrance to conduct three functions during card tagging, including face recognition (even if employees are wearing a face mask), temperature measurement, and accordingly allow or deny access to the site. Another digital access control example uses a thermal camera to measure employees' temperature to approve access to the site. Despite manually keeping an access log for the site, a digital device has been installed at the site entrance to measure entrants' temperature and record data. This allows for acquiring data without human intervention. The thermal camera has been used in common and high traffic areas to monitor personnel temperature and notify the management via email alerts if an abnormal temperature has been detected.

In light of the profound disruptions and rapid changes that have stemmed from the virus outbreak, robustness is essential to maintain planned performance, while flexibility is vital to respond to changes and adjust plans and policies accordingly. In this regard, the case study reveals that new requirements have emerged, including guidelines, standards, and legislation related to COVID-19, which add a new dimension of robustness. Production systems and supply chains must comply with these emerging requirements to ensure their ability to maintain planned performance in addition to adjusting and coordinating their decision-making and risk management processes. Likewise, the continuous development of flexibility is much needed to manage production systems and supply chains.

This is a safety-related measure that directly affects the social sustainability aspect as well as supporting business continuity and economic growth, which are resilience-related measures. In this regard, this study provides an essential step towards a better understanding of the relationship between sustainability and resilience concepts in supply chains, which is not well established in the literature as demonstrated by the different reported views by Marchese et al. (2018) ; Roostaie et al. (2019a) ; Roostaie et al. (2019b); and Renn (2020) . The presented monitoring and mitigation plan offers a structured approach to be easily implemented in the industry. Additionally, the quantification of the benefits of applying this plan such as the number of infected workers, the number of subject 1 cases and further virus transmission, and the number of shutdowns may be used to enhance the understanding of the relation between resilience and sustainability. Moreover, the findings of this case study partially support the second view, i.e., sustainability is a basis for resilience, in line with Balugani et al. (2020) argument. More specifically, social sustainability has proven key for resilience-building as well as sustainability development during pandemics.",

It further ensures the continuity of the risk management process, increasing, thus, system preparedness for future risks. Third, coordination and alignment within supply chain actors are vital to manage risks and ensure the different actors' resilience and sustainability and hence the supply chain. Fourth, although the case under study represents a specific industry, analogies may be drawn to other similar industries or products that continue to have high demand during the pandemic, such as pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and PPE. Due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and its enormous effect globally, case-based research may play a vital role in documenting lessons learned, making comparisons among industries, regions, decision levels, and supply chain actors. A thorough analysis of the different practices and assessing their impact may help draw conclusions, establish new theories, and redefine existing concepts.",

Furthermore, the design of performance measurement frameworks that can simultaneously address sustainability and resilience is recommended. These frameworks need to include a dynamic measure to cope with resilience requirements while covering the sustainability triple bottom line. Since the integration of sustainability and resilience is in infancy, there is a need to delineate the intersection of both dimensions and to quantify the relationship between them and their components.",

The social dimension of sustainability has been set at the highest priority as far as the health and safety of personnel and product (food) safety were concerned. Social sustainability under the pandemic was a means of ensuring business continuity and, thus, economic sustainability. The resilience of the production system expressed in terms of flexibility and robustness has been the main driver and sustainability for decision-making on tactical and operational levels, as detailed in Section 5.Risks that stemmed from the pandemic have been managed on the supply chain level by the Company's Global Manufacturing Excellence Team, and a set of operational practices have been identified based on the risk level identified through risk assessment. The operational practices are mainly dependent on external (country-related) approaches and workers' vulnerability for getting infected. The different levels have been named tiers, and operational practices are associated with each tier. The more severe the conditions are (reflected by the number of COVID-19 cases), the stricter the operational practices are. Guided by the developed tier system, the management of the production system has implemented the decision-making framework with an emphasis on risk management and by applying the quality management approach of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle as indicated in",

Also, newly introduced measures (number of workers per line per zone, the social distance between workers, percentage of virtual teams, number of subject 1 cases, and further virus transmission) are used to monitor the production system performance during the pandemic given the significant changes made across the different planning levels. Such measures are mainly related to social sustainability and robustness. These measures may be used as components in a newly devised KPI to integrate sustainability and resilience assessment and help filling the gap identified in the literature byRoostaie et al.
