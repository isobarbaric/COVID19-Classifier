The use of middle censoring scheme has been shown to be very appropriate under the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Cause-specific quantile inference under middle censoring is employed. Such quantile inferences are obtained through cumulative incidence function based on cause-specific proportional hazards model."

We obtain estimates of the unknown parameters and cause specific quantile functions under classical as well as a Bayesian set-up. A Monte Carlo simulation study assesses the relative performance of the different estimators. Finally, a real life data analysis is given applying the proposed methods."

Jammalamadaka, S Rao and Mangalam [10] introduced a modern concept of censoring scheme known as middle censoring, which has received considerable attention in the statistical literature. In this censoring scheme the exact lifetimes of some individuals are observed while for others, it becomes unobservable as they fall in some random censoring intervals. This censoring scheme arises prominently in time to event analysis in clinical trial studies. Moreover, middle censoring also occurs when the mechanism where the observations are being taken, is closed for a period, due to an external emergency such as the outbreak of disease, war or a strike."

Some of the patients may receive the tamoxifen-alone arm and remaining patients received the combination of radiation and tamoxifen arm. Investigators may be interested to observe events such as local relapse, auxiliary relapse, remote relapse, second malignancy of any kind, and death. After the surgery patients are discharged and they are instructed that they have to come to the hospital for routine check-up and follow-up. But in the pandemic situation, many countries declared a nationwide complete lock-down so that many patients fail to get routine check-ups, and the investigators may also lose the follow-up on these patients. In the interim, some of the patients may experience an event of interest. In this situation the exact time of the event occurrence can not be observed for some patients except for noting the interval for the event-time, and learning on later inspection that the actual event has occurred during this interval. Thus, middle censoring is highly relevant with immediate application in real life."

For example, the median survival time has long been used to assess the survival curve.

As expected, for small sample size the Bayes estimates under both the loss functions are better than MLE in terms of MSE, AVL and CP. It is also noticed that the CPs for ACIs of the cause specific quantile functions for sample size 25 are little bit away from the nominal level (95%). Similarly, for = 50, 100 and 200 we can say that Bayes estimates of baseline parameters and cause specific quantiles under both the loss functions are quite better except some values in sample size 200. The Bayes estimates for llf-1 are smaller as compared to llf-2. From Table 1 and Table 2 it is observed that for fixed sample sizes the MSE and AVL of all the estimates is increases as the censoring percentage increases except for some values. Therefore, it indicates that as the censored observations are increased this will leads to the less efficient estimates. This implies that if the spread of corona virus is not under control in a reasonable period of time, then it will have a significant impact on the human health-care system.

We have taken real data from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 to 1984. This data set is available in survival package of R software. During this tenyear period, 312 patients were randomly assigned to receive D-penicillamine or placebo treatment from a total of 424 patients. The remaining 112 patients did not take part in the clinical trial but agreed to have their basic measurements taken and to be followed for survival. Six of those patients were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so these patients were removed from the study. 161 patients died at the end of the study, 25 patients received a liver transplant, and 232 patients were lost to follow-up. As a result, for two competing outcome variables, liver transplant and death, the competing risks model becomes more reasonable. All the survival times are measured in days. For more information on this PBC data, one may refer to Therneau and Grambsch [27] and application of competing risk on PBC data is available in [13] . In order to compute the survival time in years, it divided by 365, which yielded a median survival time of 4.74 years. First, we check the goodness of fit of the Weibull distribution using fitdistrplus package in R software with assumption that the data is complete. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the empirical distribution function and the fitted Weibull distribution function is 0.0331 and the corresponding -value is 0.7378. Therefore, Weibull model appears to be reasonable and cannot be rejected. We also consider the graphical method of goodness of fit to check the appropriateness of the model as given in Figure 1 and it indicates that the model fits well to the data."

But this PBC data set does not have middle censored observations and currently we do not have any middle censored follow-up data. However, once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, it is possible that middle censored follow-up data will be available. Therefore, we created an artificial data set using middle censoring, whose left end point is equal to the observed time and the right end point is equal to the + , where is the width of the interval, which is generated from an exponential distribution with a mean value of 10. Then, all the censored individuals in the original data set are considered as the middle censored observations. The competing outcome variables for middle censored observation are randomly assigned from transplant and death. For this new data set which consists observed exact lifetimes and censored intervals, we check the PH assumption of the model (4) by considering treatment as a covariate. To examine the PH assumption for transplant and death we utilize the graphical method known as Andersen plot [3] . The covariate treatment is discrete and take two values 1 and 2 for D-penicillmain and placebo respectively. We also assume that 106 patients who do not participate in the trial they received the D-penicillmain treatment. Thus data are divided into two strata, corresponding to D-penicillmain and placebo individuals. Suppose that\u039b 0 ( ) be the estimate of baseline cumulative CSHF for jth cause in rth stratum, = 1, 2 for transplant and death, and = 1, 2 for D-penicillmain and placebo respectively. We plot\u039b 1 0 ( ) versus\u039b 2 0 ( ) for transplant and death. If the proportionality assumptions holds then these plots should be a straight line passing through origin which is verifying by the Figure 2 ."

These are presented in Table 3 and Table 4 under proposed methods of estimation. The Bayes estimates are obtained under SELF and LLF loss functions based on non-informative priors because we have no past information about the unknown parameters. For non-informative priors we assume that 1 = 1 = 21 = 21 = 22 = 22 = 0.0001 and where 1 and 2 are said to follow normal distribution with mean zero and large variance. From Table 3 it is observe that the MLE and Bayes estimates of the unknown parameters are very close. We also estimate the baseline CIFs based on equation (7) for transplant and death under MLE and Bayes estimates. Plots of the baseline CIFs are presented in Figure 3 in which solid line represents the estimates of the CIF due to death and dotted line represents the estimates of the CIF due to transplant. From Figure 3 it is observed that the estimates of CIFs have smaller value for transplant as compared to death. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 and for death are approximately 2.2 and 3.6 years respectively. Quantile event times gives the information about the stay of the patients in waiting queue, this implies that the 10% and 20% patients will receive the the transplant soon after 4 and 7 years respectively and 10% and 20% patients died soon after 2.2 and 3.6 years respectively. This shows that the waiting time of the patients to receive the transplant is roughly two times larger as compared to the death under both the treatment groups. It is observed that the quantile estimates under both the treatment groups have minor differences. This indicates that the effect of treatment is not significantly different on transplant and death."

            "text": "This article considers parametric cause specific quantile inference of the CIF under middle censoring scheme. In this study we have discussed the use of middle censoring scheme in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This research could provide a useful statistical framework for medical practitioners to obtain precise survival analysis for patients who were lost to follow-up due to this pandemic. We believe this to be first such attempt to model the quantile event times of the middle censored data under competing risks. The regression model was developed based on Cox PH model by assuming a very flexible Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard function. Also, we provide the estimates of unknown parameters and cause specific quantiles under both the classical and Bayesian set-up. The simulation study shows that the Bayes estimates perform well based on informative priors under squared error loss function in terms of MSE as compared to MLE. However, all the estimates exhibit the consistency property, as also the identifiability and appropriate convergence of the proposed model. Overall, the proposed inferences performed well in simulation studies. In a real data analysis on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis of the liver, goodness of fit criteria verify that the Weibull model fits well to the data. Also the covariate treatment maintains the assumed model PH assumption. Other semi-parametric regression models, such as additive hazard regression model and proportional odds model, may also be appropriate in this context and will be explored elsewhere. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 Partial derivatives of the log-likelihood of Equation (13) with respect to each of the parameters gives the following equations.
