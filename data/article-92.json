            "text": "A potential ability of stem cells (SCs) is to regenerate and repair tissues in the human body by providing great prospects for therapeutic applications in the field of medicine. Currently, SC therapy is used in various conditions like diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, etc. but faces some limitations like patient biocompatibility and chances of cross-infection. SCs are further modulated with nanoconjugates to overcome such challenges and will offer an advantage in the treatment of COVID-19. This pandemic requires design and development of proper treatment to save the life of human beings. Advancements in SC-based nanoconjugated therapy will open new avenues and create a significant impact in the development of futuristic nanomedicine. It may also emerge as a potential therapy for the management of infection in patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 and related diseases such as pneumonia and virus-induced lung injuries."

The main routes for the transmission were found to be respiratory droplet, physical contact as well as mother-to-infant transmission. There are asymptomatic clinical manifestations or symptomatic conditions like dry cough, fatigue, loss of taste and fever whereas few patients experience sore throat, running nose, abdominal and gastrointestinal discomfort [21] . The routes of transmission, common symptoms, prevention, safety and treatment of COVID-19 are shown in Fig. 2b . Infected individual organs especially cause liver function abnormality due to bile duct cell disruption and hepatocytes impairment. Major population face pneumonia infection with dysfunction in oxygen supply due to abnormalities in lung which created a need for large numbers of ventilators globally.

A receptor S protein found in SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) binds to the infected host for facilitating the invasion of a virus into the host cell causing human-to-human transmission [24, 25] .

The viral genome is released from the ribosomes causing conformational changes in the spike protein followed by proteolysis of cathepsin L for virus opening into the cytoplasm and uncoating the nucleocapsid for endogenous protein hydrolysis. The viral polymerase reaction takes place in host receptor with the help of binding mechanism where host proteases cleave the spike protein to form single-stranded RNA and release it into the cytoplasm for replication and transcription of subgenomic proteins. Such proteins like spike envelope and membrane proteins translate in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and later transferred to the intermediate compartment (ER-Golgi) to initiate the process of maturation.

SC metallic nanoparticles act as nanobiosensors on functionalization with DNA, peptides, receptors, etc. in biomedical engineering [49] . Invivo reconstitution of embryonic SC nanoparticles show therapeutic action for degenerative diseases like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, etc. and regulation of genetic conditions. Carbon nanotubes, nanowires and nanofibers emerge as a potential nanovehicle for the development and delivery of biomolecules to mesenchymal SCs to create novel electroactive for biomedical and bioengineering applications. Antibiotics loaded with adipose-derived, bone marrow-derived or mesenchymal SCs showed effective antibacterial and antimicrobial activities against drug-resistant infections in the cases of cancer, cardiac complications, etc. [50] Use of silver nanoparticles altered the embryonic SC structure and displayed antimicrobial effect due to the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [51] . SC-based nanoparticles inhibit the replication of viruses by inactivating their attachment to the host cells.

Use of mesenchymal SC showed beneficial effects in inflammatory lung disorders, considering similar mechanism in SARS-CoV2 immunopathogenesis displayed therapeutic potential in the management of this pandemic. The major application of mesenchymal SC is utilized to regulate the inflammatory response and immunological tolerance against antigens for betterment of pulmonary functionality [63, 64] . Mesenchymal SC-based therapy prevents the cytokines release from the immune system, lowers C-reactive protein level and enhances the recovery of epithelial and endothelial cells. Further, these cells secrete keratinocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1 to promote microbial and alveolar fluid clearance and revival of infected lungs. This shows a potential treatment for virus-induced respiratory distress in adults. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptor to enter into cells but shows resistance to the infection due to its absence in the mesenchymal SC. In case of corona virus infected patients, SCs are beneficial due to their antioxidant, immunomodulatory and self-reparatory actions from extracellular vesicles. To attenuate lung edema development, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory models were used by stabilizing endothelial fluid leakage [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Different cell models of alveolar and lung epithelial cells were studied to confirm the biological effect against influenza virus using various mechanisms by inhibiting CD8+ T-cells, restoring alveolar fluid and enhancing alveolar protein permeation [71] [72] [73] . The variations in the results remain unclear due to the implementation of different approaches like administration route of SCs, host age and disease history and inflammatory patterns. Antivirals, antibiotics and monoclonal antibodies are the primary drugs used as a symptomatic treatment in COVID-19 infected patients suffering from various conditions like pneumonia and respiratory epithelium damage, but at the same time the treatment for inflammation and regenerative process in the lungs showed limitation [74, 75] . Pretreatment of mesenchymal SCs with TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 stipulates licensing approach for the effectiveness in the clearance of immune response and better repairing of lung tissue [76] ."

            "text": "Pre-clinical models showed positive response towards SC therapy in virus-induced lung damage and hence this therapy is considered as an effective approach in lung injury, still CoV-induced lung damage pre-clinical models are under investigation. Inflammatory monocytes-macrophages and neutrophils generate effective secretion of cytokines or chemokines with T cell response. Various immunosuppressive molecules like IL-6, IL-10, PGE2, etc. are produced by mesenchymal SCs further helpful for proliferation of T-cells and NK-cells. CoV-induced lung injury is modulated using mesenchymal SCs by enhancing the immunoregulatory properties leading to elevation in cell regenerations like T-cells, NK cells, B-cells, neutrophils, etc. for the development of new lung cells. To establish this therapy in a better way, the safety and efficacy profiles are studied in clinical trials (CTs) to explore the potential in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and lung diseases [77, 78] . CTs in COVID-19 patients with respiratory complications administered with mesenchymal SCs showed higher recovery and patient survival rates, using intravenous mesenchymal SCs for significant reduction in inflammation and improvement in pulmonary function [2] . Genetically modified human stimulated pluripotent SCs are still under research as a novel therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections [79] . Some current updates on CTs of COVID-19 are shown in Table 3 ."

            "text": "The urgent need for medication in this pandemic shows rigorous investigations and pre-CT for the development of effective therapy. Use of mesenchymal SCs demonstrated a lack of explanation of their effectiveness against viruses especially in in-vivo study, so further investigation is required. There are findings related to virus-induced lung injuries into lung models but there is no pre-clinical data available for mesenchymal SCs administration in CoV respiratory infection models. Some animal models like mice and non-human primates were observed for intranasal administration but the negative clinical pulmonary disease resulted in humans with the signs of weight loss, secretory cell hyperplasia, accumulation of macrophages, etc. The limited data availability and understanding of potential SC-based NCs effect in lung injury models need to be developed with clinical investigations and uphold the standards of therapy to meet the human usage and safety. FDA recently licensed cord-based blood products for Dinh et al. demonstrated inhalation-based SC therapy to find the efficacy on ex-vivo and animal models. It showed potential on various models of lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis by reducing collagen accumulation and myofibroblast proliferation. Because of such advantages, this therapy emerges as a therapeutic potential in COVID-19 for lung regeneration. Hence, SC-based NCs need further evaluation to facilitate therapeutic testing in SARS-CoV-2 models to represent viral replication and pathology signs with comparative mortality levels [81] [82] [83] [84] . Many challenges must be tackled for optimization of SC-based NC formulations like dose of active, scale-up, quality control and storage condition. Moreover, limited access to the clinical data due to the nonavailability of COVID-19 model increases the risk of treatment. After the availability of cellular therapy for corona virus, surveillance from the regulatory authorities is strictly needed to control the unethical and unapproved products for SC therapy."

            "text": "Mesenchymal SCs conjugated nanosystems are proposed as a potential therapy to treat CoV-induced lung injury and thus, further pre-clinical studies are needed for clinical evaluation with stringent guidelines. Moreover, to confirm the manifestation differences in the different age groups, delivery routes, clinical indices and unexplored mechanisms further investigations are required. Though, there are more than 17 ongoing CTs mostly involved with intravenously administered mesenchymal SCs but the major barriers are the risks associated with transmission and cell adaption. To achieve NC SC-based therapy, patient randomization is a necessary protocol to emphasis the opportunities and progression in order to achieve a successful preventive or curative therapy. The SC-based NC may result as a novel biological breakthrough in the management and treatment of CoV2 infections in near future."
