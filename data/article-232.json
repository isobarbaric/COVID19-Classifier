Results of needs surveys among intensivists reveal emphasis on basic cardiac, lung and abdominal ultrasound, which are the commonest POCUS modalities in the intensive care unit. We therefore aim to describe the key diagnostic features of basic cardiac, lung and abdominal ultrasound as practised by intensivists or emergency physicians in terms of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), clinical utility and limitations. We also aim to explore POCUS protocols that integrate basic cardiac, lung and abdominal ultrasound, and highlight areas for future research."

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) fills a void to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and some features may also guide prognosis and management. However, image acquisition and interpretation needs to be done with skill and caution to avoid inadvertent over-or underdiagnosis of abnormalities. POCUS misdiagnoses due to inexperience may lead to errors in the treatment that may worsen patients' outcomes or even be fatal [2] . Each POCUS practitioner must be mindful of this, and follow up or evaluate with alternatives where applicable. It is still important that any form of POCUS should be preceded by clinical examination, which provides complementary information for diagnosis and treatment."

The more recent protocols tend to integrate multiple POCUS modalities, and have stepwise diagnostic questions to be answered depending on the clinical context. For lung ultrasound, different protocols have different number of points to assess, which is based on the clinical experience of the authors.

            "text": "POCUS has proven to be essential in triaging cases in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to availability of relatively portable devices which are easy to disinfect. It reduces the logistical challenge of transporting patients to radiology suites or echocardiography units. The American Society of Echocardiographers (ASE) protocol combines cardiac, lung and vascular ultrasound and is an option for COVID-19 patients where cardiopulmonary disease requires evaluation. An added advantage of intensivists using POCUS is reducing exposure to other personnel and locations, permitting conservation of personal protective equipment Recently, POCUS has started to appear in the secondary survey of adult cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm, and can be considered especially if it does not interfere with algorithm. This is to identify potentially reversible causes for cardiac arrest [17] or to detect return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Depending on the type of shock or history preceding cardiac arrest, targeted CCE may identify clues to the underlying cause such as a plethoric IVC and absence of lung sliding associated with tension pneumothorax, or small/normal ventricles and collapsed IVC due to hypovolemic shock. CCE may also identify tamponade, thrombus-in-transit, myocardial infarction as a cause of cardiac arrest [18] . However, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) task force recommends that the individual performing POCUS is trained to minimise interruptions to chest compressions. With regards to prognostication, ILCOR currently suggests against the use of POCUS for prognostication during cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to weak evidence for any CCE findings in predicting outcomes. Although a single small randomized controlled trial (RCT) found no improvement in outcomes with use of cardiac ultrasound during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, this result is not definitive and more research is required [19] ."

These include airway ultrasound, screening for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diaphragm ultrasound and ultrasound to assess the optic nerve sheath diameter. Pre-procedural airway ultrasound improves safety prior to a percutaneous tracheostomy [20] . Diaphragm ultrasound can be used to detect diaphragm dysfunction with great accuracy [21] . Optic nerve sheath diameter ultrasound allows detection of raised intracranial pressure at the bedside and can be used for prognostication post cardiac arrest [22] . Evidence for utility of these POCUS modalities in changing patient-centred outcomes is still lacking. Additionally, the training requirements and learning trajectory remain areas for further development and research. Currently, there has also been increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence that provides realtime guidance for probe placement, aids acquisition of optimal images[23], and helps to reduce exposure of healthcare workers to highly infectious cases [24] . Such technology has also been used to help users identify anatomy and do measurements of cardiac function[23]. Whether these algorithms are able to replace a trained sonographer, improve scan durations and accuracy, and improve healthcare delivery or patient outcomes remain uncertain. Robot-assisted ultrasonography, with scans conducted by operators remotely, has also been described. These devices are 5G-powered with robotic arms manipulated by an operator in another room using a simulated robotic hand [25] ."

One retrospective study found that POCUS done on ED patients prior to interventions such as fluid boluses are associated with care delays and increased inhospital mortality compared to critically ill patients with no POCUS [26] . Also, being a diagnostic and monitoring tool, the therapies given are variable depending on the clinician so it will be hard to link POCUS's utility directly with mortality. More studies are nonetheless needed to explore the effect of POCUS on patient-centred outcomes. March 9, 2022"

            "text": "Volume 11 Issue 2 Given the multitude of POCUS protocols described, there will unlikely be head-to-head studies or standardization of included devices. Each medical unit needs to adopt POCUS protocols that are relevant to its clinical practice. This process must involve multi-disciplinary stakeholders and trainers so that it remains relevant during different parts of a patient's hospitalisation. This then leads to standardised curricula so that there can be quality assurance and reduction of inter-operator differences. More importantly, the systemic adoption of POCUS protocols can allow patient-centric outcomes to be studied. Needless to say, access to a point-of-care ultrasound machine is critical in adoption of POCUS on a regular basis. Given how each patient's critical illness, response to treatment and subsequent trajectory lie on a continuum, it would be useful if the unit has a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) to allow different healthcare providers involved in the care of the patient at different stages of the hospitalisation to compare the images. This system also can be used for POCUS education or competency assessment of POCUS learners by their supervisors. Even without a PACS system, this also can be achieved on ultrasound systems which allow storage of video or still clips. Such documentation may be increasingly important for oversight of POCUS practice, which is one of the concerns raised by the Joint Commission in naming POCUS as one of the top 10 health technology hazards in 2020 [27] ."

If POCUS is integrated with structured assessments such as ACLS (Advanced cardiac life support), advanced trauma life support (ATLS), CERTAIN (Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and iNjury), and teams are equipped with ultrasound devices, it can provide additional information at the bedside which may change management. This includes right-siting of patients to the relevant medical disciplines (e.g. a dissecting aortic aneurysm sent to a hospital with cardiac surgery facilities), or pericardiocentesis in a patient who has shock due to tamponade. Pitfalls of incorporating POCUS to routine assessments include inappropriate use of this tool, misdiagnoses by inexperienced operators, excessive time taken, and distraction from clinical assessment and critical resuscitation tasks. POCUS was associated with longer pauses during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation especially comparing between ultrasound-fellowship trained vs non-fellowship trained operators [28] . If it becomes integrated in such structured assessments, teams must be mindful of the caveats and ultrasound operators should be adequately trained, with safety mechanisms inbuilt (e.g. strict timekeeping for pulse-checks and interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Such training may also need to focus on POCUS views which are more easily accessed during a resuscitation situation such as anterior lung, and subcostal echocardiography windows."

Being operator dependent, the accuracy of POCUS in detecting or excluding abnormalities may be influenced by the operator's experience. The influence of POCUS findings on treatment also depends on clinician experience. Several protocols combining different POCUS modalities have been described but the validity of these protocols in different settings still needs to be studied. There is a growing body of evidence describing the accuracy of POCUS applications, and with growing experience and competency one hopes that the accuracy will improve. POCUS should be considered a tool to confirm a diagnosis, as an extension of physical examination. More evidence is needed to recommend it as standard of care."
