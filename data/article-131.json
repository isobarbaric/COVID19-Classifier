In the field of audiology, these developments increasingly shift the service capacities from audiologists to manufacturers and technical systems. However, the technology-driven developments of manufacturers lack acceptance of hearing device users and undermine the important role of audiologists within the service provision. By following a user-centered design approach in order to deal with the technological and social challenges of disruptive services, we aim to develop service innovations on an integrated service platform in the field of tele-audiology. To ensure the acceptance of technology-driven service innovations among hearing device users and audiologists, we systematically integrated these actors in a participatory innovation process. With qualitative and quantitative data we identified several requirements and preferences for different service innovations in the field of tele-audiology. According to the preferences of the different actors, we proposed a service platform approach based on a connected hearing device in three pillars of application: 1) one-to-one (1:1) service innovations based on a remote fitting concept directly improve the availability of services offered by audiologists without being physically present. Based on this, 2) one-to-many (1:N) service innovations allow the use of the connected hearing device as an indirect data source for training a machine learning algorithm that empowers users through the automation of service processes. A centralized server system collects the data and performs the training of this algorithm. The optimized algorithm is provided to the connected hearing devices to perform automatic acoustic scene classification. This in turn allows optimization of the hearing devices within each acoustic scene. After the user-centered development of the different service innovations which are designed to converge on an integrated service platform, we experimentally evaluated the functionality and applicability of the system as well as the associated role models between the technical system, the hearing device users and audiologists.",

Although hearing difficulties affect all ages, the prevalence increases for elderly people. Due to an aging population, the number of people with at least some degree of hearing difficulties will continuously grow in the future. Through the use of new digital technologies, increasing attention has been paid to the development of service innovations in healthcare (2, 3) .

Finally, digital services reinforce the diffusion and development of other digital services and technologies which lead to lower entry barriers for future service developments and an even higher diffusion of such service offerings. The field of audiology is predestined for service innovations aiming at increasing the rate of candidates using hearing devices [HDs, e.g., hearing aids (HAs), cochlear implants (CIs)] and improving the quality of current service processes.

            "text": "As service innovations lead to fundamental changes of existing value creation processes between manufacturers, audiologists, and HD users, the development and implementation is faced with numerous technological as well as social challenges. Technological challenges are related to the integrity of the data and the performance of the delivered services. The data that the considered services will use can be highly sensitive, including personal information, location and audio signals. Consequently, the data should be exchanged safely and stored securely. This concern has been one of the main focuses from the conception to the implementation of the technical architecture (cf. section Technical Realization). Concerns for data integrity are driven by increasingly stringent regulations, such as the general data protection regulation (GDPR) acted by the European Union, as well as by end-users being sensitive to these issues. The main challenges concerning the performance of the delivered services come from the difficulty of using advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms with the limited computational resources which are typically available in HDs. HDs must perform the signal processing in real-time. The incoming signal is processed faster than a latency, called just noticeable difference, so that the HD users do not suffer under issues like reduced lip synchronization. Therefore, keeping the latency induced by signal processing within HDs below a certain level is crucial for the usability. Due to the limited computational resources designing computationally demanding signal processing algorithms for HDs in terms of required operations as well as memory requirements is a challenging task. Algorithms require many iterations for optimal performance, so called convergence. However, algorithms with high memory requirements are not suitable for HDs. Further, the data processed on a HD have a highly sensitive character. Therefore, preserving the privacy of a HD user is important. For these reasons, HDs are not allowed to save any audio material, which can contain clues about the private life of the HD users. Further, it is not allowed to save data which contain features that can be used to reconstruct the acoustic environment. As a result, machine learning algorithms that require large amounts of data to perform optimally have to be incorporated in a HD with caution.",

Service innovations that are based on disruptive technological developments have the potential to fundamentally change current value creation processes of audiologists. Disruptive service innovations challenge existing processes, routines and competencies. As competencies shift to technical systems, service innovations can lack acceptance of audiologists. Further, manufacturers in the field of audiology start to enter the service market through digital services. The service developments of manufacturers are often closely related to their product offerings and commercialized as productservice systems (8) . Although current digital service offerings of HD manufacturers are distributed and provided through audiologists, the information and data gathered remain on the side of the manufacturers. The outflow of knowledge, experience and user information can further weaken longterm competences of audiologists which leads to resistance and lack of acceptance. However, service innovations will only be implemented successfully if the complementary interaction between manufacturers, audiologists and HD users is developed and managed with respect to the specific requirements of digital service platforms. As such, service innovations require the close interaction between different actors like manufacturers, audiologists and even HD users (9) . The collaboration and integration of all actors of the service ecosystem is necessary to ensure the functionality and applicability of previously individual service components on an integrated service platform.",

Thereby, we combined advanced technological developments with the important role of human interaction between the audiologist and the HD users. Figure 1 provides an overview of the Audio-PSS platform approach that ranges from personal data-driven services (1:1 services) to automation and empowerment (1:N services) and opportunities for new service innovations outside the core field of audiology (N:M services). 1:1 services are service innovations that aim to improve the relationship between audiologists and HD users, e.g., by allowing an audiologist to continuously monitor HD settings and usage behavior or allow the HD user to contact the audiologist while being in a demanding listening situation for an instantaneous improvement of the settings. The initial fitting, e.g., of HAs, is followed by a familiarization phase in which users collect experiences and impressions of handling HAs in their everyday life. However, the user must memorize these experiences until the next appointment with the audiologist at which they talk about the experiences during the last weeks with the HAs. A common service platform could enable remote online and offline services and could provide documentation of personal experiences for later access by the audiologist. 1:N services include service innovations that use cloud computing to exchange data, experiences and recommendations of a variety of HD users to automatically fit the HD program through the analysis of aggregated user data. For instance, collective assistance functions can help especially in difficult listening situations by analyzing parameters from the current situation (e.g., location, reverberation, sound pressure level, signal-to-noise ratio) with a machine learning system that was trained offline on aggregated data. N:M services are cross-industry innovations that use the data of the connected HD in contexts outside the healthcare domain, e.g., by measuring the acoustic quality of restaurants. For instance, through acoustical monitoring and a simultaneous experience sampling by users; restaurants, cinemas, theaters, educational instructions and other localities as well as public spaces can be recommended with regard to their acoustics, communication experience and well-being, creating an acoustic quality index.",

From the social perspective, we systematically integrated HD users and audiologists in the innovation process in order to design the service innovations according to their individual needs and preferences. First, we uncovered potentials for service innovations through gaps or specific problems in the current service provision of HD users and audiologists. Further, the user groups contributed to the usability and design of service innovations, e.g., by testing and evaluating different feedback and process scenarios of the remote fitting (RF) concept. With the close integration of audiologists and HD users, we consequently aimed to change the dominating view that digital services substitute personal services. With our audiologist-centered service platform, we show potential pathways how service innovations can create new ways of value creation, improve the quality and interaction within existing service processes and enhance the competencies and opportunities of audiologists in the future service ecosystem. The requirement analysis revealed a great potential for more disruptive service innovations in the context of RF services that audiologists can offer without being physically present. Advanced technological developments like machine learning can increase the efficiency of RF services to the extent that the service can be provided by a service center or by the user alone, independent from personal interaction with an audiologist. As such, there is a great need for a design of the interaction between the HD user, the audiologist, and the technical system that ensures service innovation acceptance.",

We designed and implemented a hardware/software architecture (10) that allows audiologists to remotely access the HDs of their customers, e.g., for RF, and customers to request support from them. Additionally, this architecture allows to collect a large dataset of audio signals that can be used to improve the performance of HDs. These signals, recorded in a wide range of acoustic scenes, can be used to train advanced acoustic scene classifiers in a remote server and transmit the resulting models from this training to the considered HDs where the recognition can then be achieved in real-time. Though real-time acoustic scene classification in HDs remains a challenging task, the training being done remotely makes it more feasible. As a proof of concept, we developed a machine learning based acoustic scene classifier to automatically recognize acoustic scenes relevant for HD users. For the training of the classifier and the evaluation of the recognition accuracy, we recorded a diversity of acoustic scenes. In order to preserve the privacy of the HD users, we encoded these recordings using sparse features, which cannot be reverse-engineered for reconstructing the original audio. For the training and testing as well as for the real-time evaluation of the acoustic scene classifier, these features were incorporated.",

The audiologists highlighted the development and provision of an interactive hearing training, and the development of a scene classification solution in order to monitor the hearing environment and related issues of HD users. Self-services are merely highlighted by the HD users that formulate preferences for services that represent extended mobile control settings: \"I don't really want to adjust anything and certainly not a second device. If these functions were integrated in the smartphone I would say: Great. So many settings on one or two buttons: I'm freaking out.\" Further, a number of HD users and audiologists demand new, audiologist-centered RF solutions: \"Is it possible to bring the audiologist along the various hearing environments I experience? It would be fantastic if the audiologist could adjust my hearing aid remotely, that would be genius.\" Figure 2 shows an overview of the identification and categorization of user preferences.

The patent analysis was based on the patent database FamPat (Questel). The search period was set from 2008 to 2018. The selected patents included functions about connectivity, use of mobile devices, methods of classification, automation, RF as well as the creation and use of new digital interfaces. In recent years, technological developments focused on the creation of an infrastructure for new digital services from hardware-based rudimentary remote functions in 2008 to machine learning developments in 2018. The patent analysis revealed 21 core technological developments. Within the field of personal data-driven services (1:1 services), remote assistance like video chat between audiologists and HD users or chat-based assistance (e.g., WO2013020594) (12) was predominant. More disruptive service developments were reflected by patents on the monitoring of auditory data (e.g., EP3035710) (13) and performance data (e.g., DE102015203288) (14) . Further developments enabled intuitive, hands-free interfaces using voice commands (e.g., US2018061411) (15) or physical action based control (e.g., US2014126759) (16) through gestures, eyes, or body movement. With 15 patents, scene classification functions were the most frequently patented technological development in the recent field of automation and empowerment (1:N service, e.g., EP3288293) (17). See Figure 3 for an overview of the developments in tele-audiology since 2008. The figure shows the evolution of technological trends in the field of tele-audiology which were found out with the patent analysis.",

The HD users evaluated eight service innovations and specific design approaches of more disruptive service innovations, e.g., the design of RF services. In this context they had to choose between different specifications of the services, for example between (1) no remote fitting, (2) time-delayed remote fitting by their attending audiologist and (3) instantaneous remote fitting by a service center.

Although many HD users preferred the instantaneous RF, the personal component still plays a role, as evidenced by the decision of those over 70 against a RF at all. On the other hand, the audiologists were clearly in favor of time-delayed RF by an audiologist, because they feared a loss of competencies and decreasing quality of customer consultation. For this reason we decided to further clarify the preferences for the different RF specifications and the impact on the acceptance of the adjusted HD fitting. Consequently we followed up the requirement analysis with another evaluation study (cf. section Evaluation). In the social evaluation of RF we gave the HD users three variants to test: RF through audiologist, RF through AI, and a mixed form: RF through AI with approval by audiologists. In technological development, we focused on the mixed form to consider a system that combines both advantages of personal and digital services to meet the preferences of both audiologists and HD users.",

We decided for a platform design as HD users and audiologists favor a wide range of functionalities. However, both sides emphasized the importance of a personal relationship, which is why we aimed to offer an integrative platform where all stakeholders are joined. While many functionalities are incremental and can be fed directly into market development, we focused on RF and scene classification, as they require a high level of initial research and development effort. Developing a platform also had the advantage to build and test components for several services independently from each other. The modularity of a platform enables platform providers to adapt or expand their service offerings depending on the market needs as well as technological opportunities. As service platforms offer great interoperability, the HD as well as the collected data can be used for several service solutions provided by the integration of different stakeholders (6) . Furthermore, new service innovations can be introduced continuously after the launch of the platform. The overall architecture for the RF approach and the respective subsystems will be described in the following sections.",

Different software clients are provided for each type of users, to visualize and, if relevant, edit the content of the databases. Both, HD users and audiologists, can use mobile applications to access the data. HD users can edit the information about themselves, send messages to audiologists and select new available HD settings. HD users can as well view the acoustic index and make new entries to it. Audiologists can see the information about HD users under their care, answer their messages and change their HD settings during the RF. Acoustic index users can visualize the existing entries using a web browser. Those entries are accessed through a computing cluster that is also used by researchers to improve HD processing, more specifically, to train performant acoustic scenes classifiers. As this paper focuses on the RF application, the next subsections describe the elements of the architecture that support RF, namely the customer server and database as well as the mobile application used by the HD users.

In this paper, we introduce a machine learning approach for the recognition of acoustic scenes by incorporating the provided infrastructure for connected HDs to continuously optimize a machine learning model. In order to train such models, a large training data set is required. In the proposed approach based on the IoT, these sound samples will directly be recorded by the HD users, which raises the question about how to respect the privacy of the HD users. Therefore, we cannot use the sound samples directly to train a machine learning system. State-of-the-art machine learning approaches extract some lower dimensional features (23) , which carry the essence of the underlying sound sample. By doing this a simpler machine learning architecture with a smaller number of parameters can be defined. Moreover, we have to make sure that these features cannot be used to reconstruct the underlying sound samples. For this reason, we computed a set of privacy preserving features for training and testing of the machine learning system.",

One can easily recognize this phenomenon on the confusion matrix. We hypothesize that the reason for this result is caused by the fact that the sparse codes of these two acoustic scenes are highly similar to one another. There is another slight confusion between the acoustic scenes speech in traffic and speech in vehicle. As the recordings for the acoustic scene In Vehicle were made within different cars in traffic, this confusion is acceptable. The other acoustic scenes were classified with very high accuracies and with very little variance among different training and test sessions.",

The findings of the requirement analysis reveal that the design and interaction between audiologists, HD users and the technical system can be shaped in different ways. The preferences of both audiologists and users suggest a hybrid service process where audiologists, HD users and the technical system interact closely. However, it remains unclear whether such service design exceeds other service interaction processes in terms of user acceptance as well as subjective and even objective hearing quality. Therefore, we experimentally evaluate different RF scenarios with 18 experienced and inexperienced HD users between 59 and 80 years of age (M = 73 years, SD = 5.4 years, six female) with a mild to moderate hearing loss. The objectives of this study were to investigate the preferences of hearing-impaired participants for their HD fitting and whether these preferences influence the perception, measured by objective and subjective methods, when HD fittings are identical for each scenario.",

To ensure comparability of the measurement results, the modification of the fitting in all three scenarios was realized by switching from preset program 1 to program 2. For the experiment, three different acoustically complex listening situations were set up in the laboratory using eight circularly arranged loudspeakers, in which the subject had the task to repeat the sentences presented and to fill in a questionnaire afterwards. For the fitting adjustment, the probands were asked to either verbally describe their hearing problems in the listening situation (scenario 1) or enter them into the app for the AI system (scenarios 2 and 3). Subsequently, the setting in the HAs was changed by switching programs unnoticed by the participant and the test was repeated. The objective speech intelligibility tests performed in each scenario turned out very similarly for all three fitting scenarios (mean word scoring in %: scenario 1: 69%, scenario 2: 70%, scenario 3: 72%). The subjective questionnaires also show that the study participants did not notice any perceptible differences in, among other things, speech understanding, listening effort, or sound based on the different fitting scenarios. Furthermore, participants were asked to rate \"Which type of remote fitting would you prefer?\" (ranking from 1 to 3).",

Overall, 72.2% of participants ranked the mixed option first or second, whereas only 66.7% said this was the case for the audiologist-only option. Figure 15 depicts the preference ranking of the three fitting scenarios. In conclusion, the HD users did not notice any difference in the objective parameters but have a clear preference for a technical solution in which the audiologist is still actively involved. This is seemingly in contrast to the data from the requirements analysis, where the HD users preferred the instantaneous RF through a service center (see section Service Innovation Acceptance of Hearing Device Users). However, those over 70 years old rated the classical consulting on site (no RF) as the best alternative. And in the explorative interviews, HD users stated that the personal component should not be replaced. Since the objective evaluation of the RF scenarios did not differ, the tendency toward a technical solution, supported by an audiologist, was strengthened.",

In this context we presented the system architecture of the connected HD and the acoustic scene classification through machine learning as well as the overall development and implementation of the RF infrastructure. To conclude the user-centered developments, we evaluated the acoustic scene classification from a technical standpoint and the RF solution from both technical and social standpoints. With our interdisciplinary study, we developed digital service innovations based on connected HDs which converge on an integrated service platform. With our platform approach we focused on advanced 1:1 and 1:N services as RF and acoustic scene classification.

The HD users highlighted preferences for self-services, followed by RF services, and for services on the 1:N domain like the consideration of individual hearing preferences through scene classification and machine learning, whereas the audiologists approved particularly an interactive auditory training, and the development of an acoustic scene classification solution. An audiologist-centered RF solution was mentioned by both user groups. Based on the comparison of the user preferences and the patent analysis of service-related technological developments, we found that more disruptive service innovations mainly originate from manufacturers. With the subsequent user surveys the trends of the explorative analysis were supported: The audiologists preferred more personal data-driven services, whereas the HD users preferred self-services and services on the 1:N domain. For RF services it was particularly noticeable that they were rated quite differently by the user groups. Audiologists clearly preferred time-delayed RF by an audiologist, whereas many HD users preferred the instantaneous RF. Nevertheless, the personal component still plays a role, as evidenced by the decision of those over 70 against RF.",

Indeed, the architecture design allows to easily increase the number of users, both HD users and audiologists, as well as the connections between them, e.g., allowing each audiologist to support a larger number of HD users. Consequently, though we tested this technical solution only on a limited number of participants, it could easily be applied to a much larger user group. One of the main applications of this architecture is RF, whose proof of concept has been evaluated in the form of a remote audiogram measurement. Measuring the pure tone audiogram remotely was a key step for realizing the RF approach. The evaluation studies have shown that our proposed remote audiogram app is able to measure the hearing thresholds within the normal test-retest reliability of audiogram measurements. It also enables a first fit of the HDs remotely and is therefore a convenient tool for the RF process.",

Moreover, with multiple stakeholder integration, we showed how a service platform can connect advanced technological developments to users and audiologists. For manufacturers, we highlighted the necessity of integrating audiologists and HD users in the development of future service processes and offered a system architecture that integrates all relevant stakeholders on the same service platform. For audiologists, we raise awareness for the topic of digitalization in audiology and show that audiologists should take an active part in the development of digital service innovations. The early alignment and participation in service innovation processes ensures the sovereignty and importance of audiologists in future service processes. But most of all, the platform approach opens up new alternative ways of value creation. The re-programmability and homogeneity of digital innovations can be used to create service innovations beyond the core field of audiology.

These kinds of measurements offer a large flexibility to the HD users as well as to the audiologists. The results of the remote audiogram study showed that HD users can measure audiograms remotely and perform the first fit for their HDs based on the measurement results themselves. The possibility to monitor and accompany the measurement by an audiologist remotely reduces the risk and gives the HD user more confidence. Currently, the remote audiogram app depicts only one possible usage of the technology of connected HDs concerning the 1:1 services scenario. However, many other measurements can be handled using the same infrastructure in the future. Acoustic scene classification indicates a possible application of the 1:N services scenario using the connected HA technology. While increasing the speech intelligibility, preserving the privacy of the HD users has the highest priority in the HA signal processing. The sparse features encode the essence of an audio signal, while preventing a reconstruction of the audio. Hence, these features are very well-suited for tasks, which require collection of data for post-processing from individual HD users.",
