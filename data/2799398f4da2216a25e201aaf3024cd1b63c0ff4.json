Thereinto, siR-93C (siRNA) and positive PAMAM were firstly mixed into the electrostatic nano-intermediate, and then diselenide bond (-SeSe-)-modified HA was coved to shield excessive positive charges. This hybrid nanocomplex displayed uniform dynamic sizes, high stability, controlled zeta potential and narrow PDI distribution. Moreover, the -SeSe-linkage displayed GSH/ROS dual responsive properties, improving intracellular trafficking of siRNA. In vitro assays in A549 cell line presented that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM has low cytotoxicity, rapid lysosomal escape and significant transfection efficiency; besides, an efficient proliferation inhibition ability and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, in animal studies, this negative-surfaced hybrid nanocomplex showed a prolonged circulation in blood and improved inhibition of tumor growth. All these results verified our hypothesis in this study that diselenide bonds-modified HA could promote not only stability and safety of nanoparticles in vivo but also intracellular behavior of siRNA via redox-dual sensitive properties; furthermore, this hybrid nanocomplex provided a visible potential approach for siRNA delivery in the antitumor field.",

Compared with viral vectors, non-viral vectors are less immunogenicity, easy preparation, lower cost, and higher gene encapsulation capability; all these advantages make them attractive tools for gene therapy (Kanasty et al., 2013) . In the development of non-viral vectors, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) is an ideal candidate with high gene transfection efficiency. Because of the terminal amino groups, PAMAM molecules are positively charged at physiological pH environment, which could interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of RNAs. Moreover, amine-terminated PAMAM also shows an ability to promote endosomal escape of loaded agents via 'proton sponge' effect, which could protect genes from lysosomal degradation and further enhance transfection efficiency (Shen et al., 2010) . However, due to the high positive charge on the surface, the toxicity profile of PAMAM is still a major problem limiting its preclinical research and clinical applications (Lee et al., 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2010) . In order to reduce the toxicity of PAMAM, surface modification and/or cation block strategies are very much required (Waite et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2017; . However, as the membrane potential of cells is usually negative, the decrease of the surface positive charge of vectors would lead to reduced cellular uptake and gene transfection efficiency (Jiang et al., 2009) .",

Compared with normal cells, most tumor cells exhibit higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), it has been reported that the concentration of GSH in cancer cells (2-10 mM) was much higher than that in normal cells (2-20 lM) (Fang et al., 2009; Du et al., 2020; . This unique redox environment of tumor allows the breakage of redox sensitive bonds, for example, disulfide bonds or diselenide bonds, to release loaded cargoes (Shen et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2016; . More recently, diselenide bonds have emerged as attractive bio-signal sensitive linkage. Similar as disulfide bonds, diselenide bonds could be cleaved at tumor-relevant redox environment (Ma et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2017) . In addition, block copolymers containing diselenide bonds also have c-ray response capabilities, indicating that the diselenide bonds can be used to combine chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Cao et al., 2013) , and it is also reported that selenium compounds can help treatment of COVID-19 (Kieliszek & Lipinski, 2020) .",

Thus, in this work the ideal N/P ratio was 10. Under this N/P ration, the particle size of constructed siR-93C@PAMAM complex was 149 nm (PDI \u00bc 0.114), and the zeta potential of complex was \u00fe24.7 mV (shown in Figure  2 (B)). Further, in order to reduce the surface positive charge to improve the stability of siRNA during blood circulation, HA-SeSe-COOH was introduced as the outer shell to cover the inner core siR-93C@PAMAM; at the same time, the particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM would be increased also. To optimize the employed amount of HA-SeSe-COOH, different mass ratios of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR-93C@PAMAM were tested between 0.2/1 and 4/1. The particle size results are shown in Table 1 . It was found that when the ratio was from 0.6/1 to 1.2/1, there was no nano association complex constructed in the system, this may be caused by the random aggregation of siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH when the zeta potential of mixture close to zero. On the other side, the amount of HA-SeSe-COOH could not only affect the stability of complex, but also affect the surface charge and particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM. It was found that when the HA-SeSe-COOH was less than siR-93C@PAMAM, the zeta potential of complex was positively charged even the particle size could be similar to each other. For example, when the mass ratio of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR-93C@PAMAM was 0.3/1 and 3/1, complexes with similar particle size (197 nm and 181 nm, respectively) would be obtained, however, the zeta potential was markedly different, positive complex (\u00fe12.4 mv) was constructed when the ratio was 0.3/1 compared with negatively charged complex (-24.6 mv) with the ratio of 3/1. Considering the issue of biological safety (which will be discussed in the next section), the ratio of 3/1 was used in the following study, which the siRNA-loading efficiency was 3.23%. The morphology of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (with the ratio of 3/1) was observed by TEM to further obtain the nanostructure information. TEM image (Figure 2(C) ) showed that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM was spherical particle with the obvious nano structure.",

From Figure 3 (A) it could be found that the cytotoxicity of both siNC@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/ siNC@PAMAM was concentration dependent. Compared with HA-SeSe-COOH/siNC@PAMAM, the cytotoxicity of siNC@PAMAM is generally higher at the same siNC concentration, which was due to electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cell membrane and positively charged siNC@PAMAM under physiological conditions as the extensive number of amino groups on the surface of PAMAM. As expected, the cytotoxicity of HA-SeSe-COOH/siNC@PAMAM was significantly reduced by increasing amount of HA-SeSe-COOH, indicated that the shell of HA-SeSe-COOH would considerably enhance the biocompatibility of PAMAM. When the siNC was 100 nM, the survival of A549 cells was still 81.5% in HA-SeSe-COOH/siNC@PAMAM (3/1) group, which was obviously higher than that of 65.2% in HA-SeSe-COOH/ siNC@PAMAM (0.3/1) group and 49.5% (siNC@PAMAM).

Thus, lysosomal escape ability of siRNA loaded complex is crucial for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy. The lysosomal escape ability study was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). From the CLSM images (shown in Figure 3 (C)), the yellow signal, overlap area of red fluorescence (lysosome) and green fluorescence (green fluorescent FAM labeled siR-93C), indicated that siR-93C was trapped in lysosome; after siR-93C escaped from lysosome, bright cyan fluorescence could be observed from CLSM image, also the separation of green fluorescence with red region was detected (shown in Figure S1 ). In siR-93C@Lipo2000 group, siR-93C was mainly present in the lysosome at 2 h. Although there was slight cyan fluorescence signal could be observed at 4 h, the stronger yellow signal indicated that most of the siRNA was still localized in lysosome until 8 h. In the siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/ siR-93C@PAMAM groups, a fast and effective lysosomal escape could be observed at even 2 h as the cyan signal was clearly observed from CLSM indicating the spread out of the siR-93C from lysosome. The effective lysosomal escape ability was accounted by the proton sponge effect\" of PAMAM. Though the HA-SeSe-COOH shell may affect the efficiency of lysosome escape, the GSH-responsive disassembly of the shell and re-exposure of siR-93C@PAMAM in the tumor intracellular environment could still trigger the lysosome escape.",

As shown in Figure 4(A) , the results showed that the transfection efficiency was improved when increasing the siRNA concentration, all the group showed the highest transfection efficiency when the siR-93C concentration was improved to 100 nM, which was almost 2-fold as compared to 10 nM. Surprisingly, luciferase expression in siR-93C@PAMAM, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (0.3/1) and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) was no significant difference. It has been found that the positively charged particles strongly interact with cells and penetrate into the cells more effectively than negatively charged particles. In this study, siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (0.3/1) were positively charged, whereas the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) was obviously negatively charged. The possible explanation for transfection result was that the penetration ability of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) into A549 cells could be improved by the hyaluronic acidderivative shell, as hyaluronic acid could specifically bind to CD44 which was overexpressed on A549 cells surface (Cano et al., 2020) .",

As shown in Figure  6 (A), though the siRNA fluorescence signal was observed in the tumor tissue at 3 h in siR-93C@Lipo2000 group, extensive fluorescence signal was also detected in the whole body (until 12 h), indicating that siR-93C@Lipo2000 didn't exhibit specific tumor-targeting ability. In the siR-93C@PAMAM treated group, the tumor tissue exhibited fluorescence signal from 6 h till 9 h, and it significantly reduced at 12 h. It should be noted that the accumulation of siR-93C@PAMAM in the lungs and kidneys was significantly higher than other organs even up to 12 h after injection, indicated that siR-93C@PAMAM mainly passively accumulated in the tumor and distributed in the lung and kidney. On the other side, due to the positively charged property, siR-93C@PAMAM could be easily captured and rapidly eliminated by reticuloendothelial system (RES) and exhibited short circulation time after intravenous administration. As expected, tumor signal in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM group was initially observed and accumulated at 3 h up to 12 h (fluorescence intensity was still extremely high after 12 h), which was due to the active targeting and binding ability of HA to CD44 (overexpressed on A549 cells). At the same time, the protective outer layer of HA-SeSe-COOH could allow complex a longer circulation time, consequently, increasing the accumulation within tumors (Ho et al., 2019). 3.12. In vivo anticancer activity and safety evaluation Figure 6 (B) shows the tumor volume of different treatment groups, negligible effects on tumor fast growth were observed in the treatment with siR-93C@Lipo2000 compare with saline group because of the limited bioavailability of siR-93C@Lipo2000. Excitingly, both siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM treated groups showed significant inhibition on tumor growth, with tumor volume considerably smaller than the saline group and siR-93C@Lipo2000 treated group. After 21 days treatment, the tumors of nude mice were harvested to evaluate the tumor growth inhibition effect (in Figure 6 (C)). It was found that the HA-SeSe-COOH/ siR-93C@PAMAM treated group showed the most remarkable suppression effect, as the tumor volume inhibitory rate reached to approximately 74.0%, showing that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM could successfully inhibit the tumor growth. This result may be due to the efficient siRNA delivery and transfection. In addition, there was no observed weight loss of nude mice during the animal study period (in Figure  6 (D)). Furthermore, according to H&E stained tumor slices images ( Figure 6 (E)), negligible level of necrotic cells was observed in saline and siR-93C@Lipo2000 treated mice. In contrast, obvious necrosis and inflammation was observed in siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM treated groups, this result was consistent with the inhibitory effect of A549 cells in vitro study.",
