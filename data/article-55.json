            "text": "Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telehealth was rarely utilized for oncologic care in metropolitan areas. Our large New York City based outpatient breast/ gynecologic cancer clinic administered an 18-question survey to patients from March to June 2020, to assess the perceptions of the utility of telehealth medicine. Of the 622 patients, 215 (35%) completed the survey, and of the 215 respondents, 74 (35%) had participated in a telehealth visit. We evaluated the use of telehealth services using the validated Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire. Sixty-eight patients (92%) reported that telehealth services saved them time, 54 (73%) reported telehealth increased access to care, and 58 (82%) reported telehealth improved their health. Overall, 67 (92%) of patients expressed satisfaction with the use of telehealth services for oncologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth services should be carefully adopted as an addition to in-person clinical care of patients with cancer."

Although the current guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology provide that telemedicine should be utilized to expand service capabilities, telemedicine has, historically, rarely been utilized in providing oncologic care [9] . A meta-analysis by Chen et al. [10] , studied the psychosocial outcomes of telehealth interventions on breast cancer patients; however, it did not evaluate patients' perceptions of the care they were receiving. A systematic review by Cox et al. [11] studied cancer survivors' experience with telehealth. However, none of the participants included in their review were actively receiving treatment. Despite these shortcomings, both Chen et al. and Cox et al.' s findings [10, 11] support the positive impact of telemedicine on patients. Chen et al. [10] found that telehealth interventions resulted in greater alleviation of stress and had a positive effect on patients' quality of life, perceived distress, and self-efficacy. Cox et al. [11] concluded that telemedicine had the potential to provide cancer survivors with a greater sense of independence."

Several studies from programs in rural areas including Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Newfoundland and Labrador all reported high patient satisfaction from the majority of patients, as well as other benefits such as convenience and cost effectiveness [12, 13] . It is likely that these individuals would have different experiences from those living in a metropolitan area during a global pandemic. Cancer patients living through COVID-19 may feel an increased sense of isolation and fear, and have less access to social support due to social distancing and quarantine [4] . At our large NYC-based outpatient breast and gynecologic cancer clinic, telehealth services were quickly adopted for visits that could be completed outside of the clinic, in order to limit patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. These services consisted of video-based telehealth visits through the electronic medical system. These visits were typically 15 to 30 minutes in duration, with patient assessed vital signs (when indicated), limited physical exam based on visual inspection, and patient and provider-based discussion of the patient's oncologic care. These services replaced nonessential in-person visits but did not replace essential visits required for physical exams, laboratory checks, chemotherapy, or other treatment administration. Any concerns that could not be addressed via telehealth required the scheduling of an in-person visit."

An 18-question survey was administered to all patients receiving care at our outpatient breast and gynecologic cancer treatment center from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 (Appendix 1). Patients were included if they were seen in the clinic during that time, as well as if they had visits delayed or cancelled during this period. The survey was administered both by email through REDCap and physical copies given at the clinic, wherein the survey was returned anonymously through a drop-box. All responses were de-identified and personal data was not available to the researchers. This study received approval from the Mount Sinai Hospital institutional review board [IRB] (IRB-20-03619). The study was exempt from requiring the patient's completion of a consent form. Consent was obtained by completion of the survey itself and the patient's review of the exemption form which was attached to the survey. Survey responses were summarized by number (%) using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA). No hypothesis testing was performed."

The SUTAQ assesses patient acceptability of telehealth services via measures of accessibility, comfort, usability, privacy and security, confidentiality, satisfaction, convenience, and health benefits with in-home telemonitoring.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in the structure of oncologic care for the patients in our NYC center as we experienced the first peak of the pandemic from March through June 2020. The adaptation of telehealth services was one of the greatest changes to our practice, with telehealth visits increasing from rare usage to accounting for about 30% of all visits. Overall, patients with breast and gynecologic malignancies expressed satisfaction with the use of telehealth services for oncologic care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although most patients do not feel that this is a suitable replacement for their in-person care, they expressed that it was certainly a good addition to their care. A large majority of patients expressed interest in continuing to participate in telehealth visits in the future. Based on this data and prior studies, telehealth services should be carefully adopted as a long-term addition to the in-person clinical care of patients with cancer, including those being treated in metropolitan areas. There were several strengths to this study. First, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to assess the rapid implementation of telehealth on a large scale, which otherwise likely would not have occurred. Secondly, it allowed us to receive rapid feedback regarding use of these services during an emergency public health situation. Based on the results of our study, telehealth is an excellent option for care of breast and gynecologic patients during times when in-person visits may need to be limited. These results also support the use of telehealth services in metropolitan areas and in high-risk oncology patients-patient groups in which the perception of telehealth has rarely been explored."

The safety of telehealth services for breast and gynecologic cancer patients has not been specifically established, although major safety issues have not been reported in prior studies [10, 11] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, benefits of telehealth outweighed the risks, and it was widely adapted. This study reported subjective measures of patient satisfaction but did not evaluate objective measures of patient safety and cancer-related outcomes which will need to be established in future large-scale studies with prolonged follow-up. However, in this study reported here, patients did not report any specific safety-related concerns in the comments section of the survey."
