Among elderly nursing home residents who had received two doses of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine 3 weeks apart in the United States, vaccine effectiveness was 74.7% against symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period of March through May 2021 but decreased to 53.1% during the period of June and July 2021, when the delta variant was predominantly circulating. 8 In Qatar, no evidence of protection against infection was seen at 20 weeks or more after mRNA vaccination. 9 Nevertheless, the extent to which reduced vaccine effectiveness is a result of a new variant or waning immunity remains unclear. Immunogenicity data indicate that antibody titers wane relatively rapidly after the receipt of two doses of vaccine, which suggests that waning may be an important factor in reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness over time, although decreases in antibody titers may be more rapid than decreases in protection. 10 A number of serologic markers have been found to correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infection but not with severe or fatal Covid-19. 11, 12 In the United Kingdom, Covid-19 vaccines have been used since early December 2020. Initially, a 3-week interval between doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine was used (for a period of approximately 4 weeks), which was then changed to an extended 12-week interval for all vaccines until June 2021; at that time, the interval was reduced to 8 weeks, after the emergence of the delta variant. In this study, we estimated vaccine effectiveness over time since receipt of the second dose of the ChAdOx1-S, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) vaccines in order to investigate the waning of protection against symptomatic Covid-19 and related hospitalization and death separately for the alpha and delta variants."

The analysis was stratified to assess vaccine effectiveness against the alpha and delta variants during the periods when they were circulating. For each outcome of interest, we compared vaccination status in symptomatic adults who had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (case participants) with vaccination status in adults who reported symptoms of Covid-19 but had a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (control participants)."

We included emergency department visits resulting in inpatient admission among persons who had symptoms within 14 days after the positive test and whose visit was not related to injury. ECDS data include hospital admissions through NHS emergency departments in England but not elective admissions. Only first visits in the 14-day period were included if a person had multiple admissions from emergency care. To allow for delays in the ECDS data flow, only case and control participants with sample dates by September 17, 2021, were included. We used a sensitivity analysis to assess only admissions of persons with Covid-19 or respiratory SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms) codes as described in the Public Health England weekly bulletin for emergency departments. 14 For the assessment of vaccine effectiveness against death, we used the NHS digital data on deaths reported in the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS). To allow for delays in death registrations and for all case participants to have at least 28 days of follow-up, we included only case and control participants with test results by July 29, 2021."

However, the incidence of Covid-19-related hospitalization and death has remained low, especially among vac-cinated adults. 20 Our finding of only limited waning of protection against hospitalization or death in most groups that we studied is consistent with the preserved vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization that was observed in Qatar. 9 Regional U.S. studies have also shown sus- .8%, a change that coincided with an increase in the circulation of the delta variant from less than 2% to more than 80% of cases. 22 Conversely, reports have appeared of an increased proportion of hospitalization among infected adults who had been vaccinated the earliest and had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine 3 weeks apart in Israel. 17 The shorter interval of 3 weeks as well as the longer follow-up in a population with rapid vaccine uptake in Israel may be factors in explaining this difference as compared Shown are data regarding vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19-related hospitalization with the delta variant, according to time since the second dose of vaccine and clinically extremely vulnerable group status, among persons 65 years of age or older.

I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Our findings and those from Qatar and the United States raise important questions about the timing of third doses of vaccine in adults who remain protected against hospitalization and death for at least 5 months after the receipt of two doses. Israel was one of the first countries to immunize adults with the BNT162b2 vaccine and began offering a third dose of the same vaccine to older adults starting in July 2021. 23 Early data indicate that the third dose was associated with large reductions in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 1 week after vaccination, with greater reductions in the second week. 23 The duration of protection offered by the third dose, however, is uncertain. Many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, are now offering a third dose."

            "text": "A third dose of vaccine improves both humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2, with increased neutralizing activity against different variants, including the delta variant, which is likely to improve protection against infection. 24 Waning of vaccine effectiveness against severe disease outcomes was relatively limited in most cohorts in this study but is likely to continue with time since the receipt of two vaccine doses. Decisions on timing of the third dose must balance the rate of waning immunity against the prevalence of disease, including the risk of new variants, and the prioritization of persons at highest risk for severe disease. Existing evidence suggests that vaccine effectiveness increases with longer intervals between doses and, if this also applies to third doses, the administration interval will also need to be considered. 25 At the same time, it is possible that third doses will be more reactogenic than previous doses, especially if the recipient receives different vaccines for the initial and booster doses. 26 Attractive alternatives include half-dose boosters or boosting with variant-targeted vaccines, which are both under investigation. 27 For the United Kingdom and countries with administration intervals that are longer than the licensed interval, another important consideration is that the extended interval of 8 to 12 weeks between vaccine doses provides higher serologic responses and increased vaccine effectiveness than the licensed interval of 3 to 4 weeks for mRNA vaccines, 25 which may provide the populations in these countries with better, longer-term protection. 12 This hypothesis is supported by our cur-rent findings comparing short and long administration intervals among persons 80 years of age or older."

            "text": "We found that waning effectiveness against hospitalization was greatest among persons in clinical risk groups. Other studies have shown lower immune responses and vaccine effectiveness among persons in clinical risk groups, most notably those with immunosuppression. 10, 21, 28, 29 The United Kingdom and other countries already recommend a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine for all adults as part of their primary immunization course. 30, 31 This study has some limitations. The testnegative case-control study design is observational and, therefore, subject to potential bias. The very narrow 95% confidence intervals in some analyses relate to the large sample size and do not account for what may be relatively larger effects of bias. A detailed quantification of potential bias is beyond the scope of this article, but others have assessed some biases such as exposure and outcome misclassification when using the test-negative design for hospitalized case and control participants. 32 A full discussion of these limitations is provided in Section S3. The likely direction of these biases, if they exist, would be to reduce vaccine effectiveness, with the reduction being greater with longer intervals after vaccination. Other limitations include our limited ability to assess waning vaccine effectiveness against the alpha variant owing to low circulation since June 2021. In addition, these estimates of vaccine effectiveness relate to the population of persons who seek testing and were successfully matched to the NIMS database, so they may not be representative of the whole population. For example, a higher proportion of non-White persons than White persons do not match to the NIMS database. We also relied on tested persons declaring their symptoms when the test was requested, and some asymptomatic persons may declare symptoms in order to access the test. Overall vaccine effectiveness will be attenuated if it is lower against asymptomatic infection and, for control participants, may mean that they were not matched on the basis of exposure to an infectious disease that led to symptoms."
