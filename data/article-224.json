            "text": "Since COVID-19 took a strong hold around the globe causing considerable morbidity and mortality, a lot of effort was dedicated to manufacturing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Many questions have since been raised surrounding the safety of the vaccines, and a lot of media attention to certain side effects. This caused a state of vaccine hesitancy that may prove problematic in the global effort to control the virus. This review was undertaken with the aim of putting together all the reported cardiovascular and haematological events post COVID-19 vaccination in published literature and to suggest possible mechanisms to explain these rare phenomena."

As some studies used the same databases as the source of their data, it was important to remove any duplicates.

The patient suffered from diabetes, HTN, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate in remission. It is difficult to establish a link between AHA and the vaccine, but that it is plausible as the patient did not suffer from any conditions that are specifically linked with AHA, such as autoimmune disease. AHA has also been reported after the administration of H1N1 vaccine, the seasonal influenza vaccine and recently the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. 46 All three cases had low levels of factor VIII and the presence of FVIII inhibitors. 46 Factor VIII is an essential component of the coagulation cascade that cleaves factor X in the presence of factor IX, and its deficiency causes haemophilia A. 117 The mechanism underlying the development of AHA is unclear. It is proposed that certain T cell genetic polymorphisms may play a role in predisposing individuals to develop AHA. 118 The mechanism of AHA might be similar to the molecular mimicry mechanism involved in ITP. Autoantibodies against factor VIII and activation of quiescent autoreactive T and B cells may play a role. 46 formed in blood vessels leading to decreased blood flow and certain implications including haemorrhage. 121 Thrombosis occurs when there is a damage to the endothelial lining of the blood vessel, a hypercoagulable state or an arterial/venous blood statis. When damage to the blood vessel wall occurs, proinflammatory cytokines are activated, tissue factor availability is increased, adhesion molecules proliferate and platelets are activated. 121 Thrombosis and haemorrhage are often viewed as two separate arms of the coagulation cascade."

The vasculitis in these patients leads to vascular endothelial dysfunction which puts them at an increased risk of thrombosis. 123 AAV is also commonly associated with haemorrhage in other organs, most commonly the lungs. This is also due to vascular dysfunction and subsequent rupture. 123 This presents a unique dilemma for clinicians treating patients with AAV who present with thrombosis as well as concurrent pulmonary haemorrhage. Treatment with anticoagulation would seemingly worsen the pulmonary haemorrhage and lead to worse outcomes, whereas withholding anticoagulation can lead to a high thrombotic burden and worse outcomes. 123 at a large cohort in a multi-state healthcare system. The old age of the patients who developed CVST following the Pfizer vaccine and the lack of concurrent TP may distinguish such cases from the VITT which were mainly reported in young females. Overall, the study did not report a significant association between COVID-19 vaccination and the development of CVST. 24 By considering that outside the veins of the lower extremities and pulmonary arteries are atypical, our results revealed that many of the thrombotic events occurred post COVID-19 vaccination can be classified as atypical due to their location. In addition to CVT/ CVST, which was the most common event to occur after vaccination among the venous thrombosis subcategory, the jugular vein was the most affected with Pfizer and J&J while the splanchnic vein was the most affected with AstraZeneca followed by the jugular vein."

It is when the immune system does not create high-quality antibodies or when the S protein is altered that adverse events, such as thrombosis, may occur. One current hypothesis in the works states that the AstraZeneca viral vector allows for alternate splicing to occur, yielding different types of S proteins which are not recognized by antibodies against the default S protein, thus causing an inflammatory response. 135 While still a very preliminary hypothesis, this may spearhead further research into the reasoning and reversal of such side effects."

            "text": "In order to answer this question, it is essential to evaluate the rate of incidence of such events following COVID-19 vaccination. One limitation was that most of the included studies were either case series or case reports. It was, therefore, difficult to calculate the prevalence of the CV and haematological events among the vaccinated populations. However, it was possible to calculate the prevalence of the CI and thrombotic events from five population studies. For example, Pawlowski et al. 24 In addition to the rarity of such events, it is important to understand that COVID-19 itself may cause CI and thrombosis. 114, 138 Furthermore, the rate of such severe events is much higher when associated with COVID-19 than the rate of vaccine-induced CI and thrombosis. For example, it was reported by Shi et al. 139 vaccines. This suggests that the rate of such events is approximately 0.000001% (3174/3.09 billion) as a total of 3.09 billion doses have been administered so far worldwide. 142 Additionally, the CDC reports revealed that it was noted after compiling the data of the different adverse events reports that the occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis was more apparent in the adolescent and younger populations. Much debate followed this observation, and many argued that the benefits of vaccinating this specific population en masse outweighed the assumed risk of developing cardiac complications."

These events are rare in occurrence and even more so in fatality. Vaccines at their core are made with the intention of stimulating the immune system. This may cause unintended activation or modulation of the immune system which can cause such things as cardiac injury or even development of antibodies against platelets; mechanisms which have been proposed to explain the reported adverse events. We are now experiencing the same thing with the COVID-19 vaccines."
