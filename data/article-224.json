Many questions have since been raised surrounding the safety of the vaccines, and a lot of media attention to certain side effects. This caused a state of vaccine hesitancy that may prove problematic in the global effort to control the virus. This review was undertaken with the aim of putting together all the reported cardiovascular and haematological events post COVID-19 vaccination in published literature and to suggest possible mechanisms to explain these rare phenomena.",

As some studies used the same databases as the source of their data, it was important to remove any duplicates. For example, Welsh et al. 22 (Tables S2-S3) used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Lee et al. 21 (Tables S2-S3) (Table S3 ) and Tarawneh et al. 43 (Table S2 ) As these studies reported the individual details of each patient, it was possible to compare and combine the duplicates to avoid over counting the cases/events. Similarly, the studies conducted by Pawlowski et al. 24 (Table S2) and Tobaiqy et al. 61 (Table   S4) , who reported cases from the Mayo clinic or Eudra Vigilance (EV) database, respectively, reported a small number of cases with the individual demographic and clinical data for each patient and no duplication was detected. However, Smadja et al. 104 In general, 44.8% of the total patients who received one of the five different vaccines were females. As shown in Figure 2A , there was no obvious trend in terms of gender.

AHA has also been reported after the administration of H1N1 vaccine, the seasonal influenza vaccine and recently the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. 46 All three cases had low levels of factor VIII and the presence of FVIII inhibitors. 46 Factor VIII is an essential component of the coagulation cascade that cleaves factor X in the presence of factor IX, and its deficiency causes haemophilia A. 117 The mechanism underlying the development of AHA is unclear. It is proposed that certain T cell genetic polymorphisms may play a role in predisposing individuals to develop AHA. 118 The mechanism of AHA might be similar to the molecular mimicry mechanism involved in ITP. Autoantibodies against factor VIII and activation of quiescent autoreactive T and B cells may play a role. 46 formed in blood vessels leading to decreased blood flow and certain implications including haemorrhage. 121 Thrombosis occurs when there is a damage to the endothelial lining of the blood vessel, a hypercoagulable state or an arterial/venous blood statis.

This is also due to vascular dysfunction and subsequent rupture. 123 This presents a unique dilemma for clinicians treating patients with AAV who present with thrombosis as well as concurrent pulmonary haemorrhage. Treatment with anticoagulation would seemingly worsen the pulmonary haemorrhage and lead to worse outcomes, whereas withholding anticoagulation can lead to a high thrombotic burden and worse outcomes. 123 at a large cohort in a multi-state healthcare system.

The vector-based vaccine works by delivering the DNA code for the spike protein, allowing our cells to transcribe it into mRNA, translate it into protein and mount an immune response against it. 133 The mRNA vaccines deliver the mRNA code directly, requiring only translation from our cells to mount an immune response. 134 In the vast majority of vaccines, the immune system creates numerous antibodies against the S protein of all COVID-19 vaccines, protecting them from the real virus as well. It is when the immune system does not create high-quality antibodies or when the S protein is altered that adverse events, such as thrombosis, may occur. One current hypothesis in the works states that the AstraZeneca viral vector allows for alternate splicing to occur, yielding different types of S proteins which are not recognized by antibodies against the default S protein, thus causing an inflammatory response. 135 While still a very preliminary hypothesis, this may spearhead further research into the reasoning and reversal of such side effects.",

In normal HIT, an antigen complex of heparin and PF4 is created, activating the immune system to create an antiheparin-PF4-complex antibody. This antibody will bind to the complex with the Fab region and bind to platelets with the Fc region, activating them and causing platelet aggregation. 136 The reason for heparin binding to PF4 in the first place is due to the cationic charge of heparin and anionic charge of PF4. This understanding of HIT provides a basis toward understanding VITT following AstraZeneca vaccination.",

One limitation was that most of the included studies were either case series or case reports. It was, therefore, difficult to calculate the prevalence of the CV and haematological events among the vaccinated populations. However, it was possible to calculate the prevalence of the CI and thrombotic events from five population studies. For example, Pawlowski et al. 24 In addition to the rarity of such events, it is important to understand that COVID-19 itself may cause CI and thrombosis. 114, 138 Furthermore, the rate of such severe events is much higher when associated with COVID-19 than the rate of vaccine-induced CI and thrombosis. For example, it was reported by Shi et al. 139 vaccines. This suggests that the rate of such events is approximately 0.000001% (3174/3.09 billion) as a total of 3.09 billion doses have been administered so far worldwide. 142 Additionally, the CDC reports revealed that it was noted after compiling the data of the different adverse events reports that the occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis was more apparent in the adolescent and younger populations. Much debate followed this observation, and many argued that the benefits of vaccinating this specific population en masse outweighed the assumed risk of developing cardiac complications.",

It was the cause of severe respiratory disease, spreading across the world at an unprecedented speed, leading to global alarm and declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. As of June 15 th , 2021, there have been 1.76 billion reported COVID-19 cases worldwide and more than 38 million deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 The enormous effect of COVID-19 on the health systems and economies of countries all over the world has driven the scientific community to come together to develop numerous diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to help curb the spread of the pandemic. Hastened manufacture and rollout of newly developed vaccines has led to the biggest vaccination campaign in history, but has left many questioning whether safety has been compromised. Furthermore, emerging reports of adverse effects of many of these vaccines have contributed to vaccine hesitancy in the community, thus becoming a hurdle in controlling the spread of COVID-19. More than 200 COVID-19 vaccines are under development, with over 60 being tested in clinical trials. 2 The first rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations began in December 2020. The most prominent of which are the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-The U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research published a protocol on background Rates of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) for COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring. Acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, haemorrhagic and nonhaemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/ pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism and transverse myelitis were listed as the ASEIs of the outcome of general population. 4 Understanding mechanisms of vaccine-induced cardiovascular (CV) complications will help in developing vaccines with a stronger safety profile. Several types of events, including thrombotic complications, have been reported in a small number of individuals who have received the COVID-19 vaccines. Unfortunately, such rare reports created some doubts and hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccines and the withdrawal of certain vaccines in some countries. It is, therefore, essential to continue monitoring the risk of rare adverse events that are not detected during the clinical trials either due to the rarity of the events or due to the long time for the onset. This review compiled all published data about the CV and haematological complications which have been reported post COVID-19 vaccination in an attempt to reflect the true picture about the occurrence of such rare events.",

Association between such events and the five types of vaccines has not been confirmed, and some studies reported that some events may have coincided with the vaccine. In this review, we compiled all relevant complications which have been reported post COVID-19 vaccination with a comprehensive discussion of the possible mechanisms without confirming their association with the vaccines. For example, MI and coronary artery thrombosis with an isolated thrombosis were each counted as cardiac events only as thrombosis can be caused by a plaque rupture rather than being induced by the vaccine. The review compares the CV and haematological events after receiving Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J and CoronaVac vaccines. We have not specifically targeted those vaccines in our inclusion criteria. However, no relevant data were available for the other COVID-19 vaccines.",

Twenty-five cases of cardiac events were detected in individuals post Moderna vaccination (24 myocarditis and 1 MI). Seventy-four cardiac events were reported in individuals who received the AstraZeneca vaccine (23 MI, 46 ischemic heart disease and 5 others, including 1 heart strain, 1 cardiac arrest and 3 ACS).

The cases represent 20%, 21.5% and 13.9% of the total cases of thrombosis following Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, respectively when stratified by age, women generally have increased risk of thrombosis as compared to men of the same age, given their higher levels of estrogen. 106 However, when the studies were compiled, there was no specific pattern for one gender being affected more than the other. In all the included studies (except Smadja et al.), there were more cases of CV and haematological complications within the 35-54 age group in all five vaccines. The age was not specified for 47.4% of the 217 cases reported after AstraZeneca vaccination. However, most of the reported cases were 35-54 years old (49.1% of the reported cases). Smadja et al. reported the median ages for the cases with thrombosis following vaccination as 76, 72 and 67 years for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, respectively. This contradicts what was widely argued about the AstraZeneca vaccine to cause thrombotic events in younger individuals. In total, 1013 CV and haematological events were reported in at least 406 individuals who received Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines as reported by 98 studies (Potteg\u00e5rd et al., was included in the number of events, but excluded from the number of cases as explained in the results section). The 1013 events were 14.9% CI, 45.4% thrombosis, 28.3% TP, 10.1% haemorrhage and 1.3% other CV and haematological events. Of these, 15.6, 4.4, 73.7, 6.0 and 0.2% were reported following Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J and CoronaVac vaccines, respectively. This may the results reported by Smadja et al., who obtained their data from VigiBase and reported 2245 arterial and/or venous thrombotic events with or without TP detected in 2161 patients following Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccination. Of these, 55.4%, 10.5% and 29.6% were reported following Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, respectively. According to Smadja et al., more thrombotic events were reported after Pfizer vaccine than with Moderna and AstraZeneca. However, the number of events following Moderna vaccine remains the lowest in the studies conducted by Smadja et al. and the remaining 98 included studies. Many of the individuals who experienced CV and/or haematological complications post COVID-19 vaccination had comorbidities/ risk factors that may increase their chances to develop such complications or even could be the direct cause of such events. However, many other individuals developed such events post COVID-19 vaccination without any underlying risk factors.The details and proposed mechanisms of each type of event are described in the next sections.",

While the overall rate of both side effects is low, it is important to look at the components of vaccines which may elicit such a response. mRNA vaccines contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). This lipid comes in numerous forms but serves the purpose of providing a lipophilic medium for active ingredients F I G U R E 5 Number and types of haemorrhagic cases/events occurring not in the context of thrombocytopenia reported following COVID-19 vaccination in 98 studies, including the studies by Potteg\u00e5rd et al. and excluding those by Smadja et al. A total of 9 haemorrhage cases were reported after receiving Pfizer vaccine (8 intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and 1 case of acquired haemophilia) while one case of ICH was reported post Moderna vaccination. Additionally, 17 events of cerebral haemorrhage (4 of which were with suspected thrombocytopenia), 74 of unspecified bleeding and 1 other (uterine bleeding) were reported following AstraZeneca vaccination. No haemorrhagic events were reported after the J&J and the CoronaVac vaccine to enter cells and illicit an immune response. 108 PEG is historically safe, with one meta-analysis reporting on 37 case reports of anaphylaxis following exposure to PEG in different forms. 108 It is possible that people who are allergic to PEG may develop an inflammatory response which may lead to myocarditis secondary to the allergic reaction. This may also explain the lower prevalence of myocarditis post AstraZeneca, J&J and Sinovac vaccines as they are devoid of PEG. One of the included studies described a case of Kounis Syndrome which is a type of coronary hypersensitivity reaction characterized by coronary-like disease accompanied by systemic anaphylaxis.109 The patient in question had received the CoronaVac vaccine which contains potential allergen components, such as aluminum hydroxide.110 Another possible mechanism is the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 which binds with high affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).111 ACE2 plays an important role in the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is a hormonal system used to regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance and systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 may cause HTN due to the downregulation of ACE2. This may explain the cases of HTN following COVID-19 vaccination as the vaccines work by introducing the S protein to the body to mount an immune response against it.Furthermore, ACE2 destroys angiotensin (AT) II into angiotensin (1-7) which modulates inflammation due to the inflammatory role of ATII.112 The interaction between COVID-19 infection itself and the RAAS has been explored in depth in some of our previous studies, and the role of ACE2 in the inflammatory response remains one of the leading hypotheses explaining some of the phenomena observed with COVID-19 infection and possibly now with vaccination as well.113,114",

Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the occurrence of VITT. Antibodies PF4-polyanion complexes Some of the patients with CVT were found to have high levels of antibodies to PF4-polyanion complexes. 72 This resembles the underlying mechanism of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) when antibodies against the PF4-heparin complex leads to the creation of a hypercoagulable state, resulting in arterial and venous thrombus formation and platelet depletion. 125 Vaccine-induced antibodies to a similar complex formed from a vaccine component and PF4 might have been responsible for the development of VITT. The vaccine component forming the complex against which antibodies are directed has still not been identified. However, some studies have investigated the potential cross-reactivity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies with PF4. 71,72,126",

Plate precursors could get infected and transcribe the adenoviral DNA leading to spike protein or other adenoviral components being expressed on the platelet surface. This could theoretically lead to immune reactions and subsequent TP. 126 4.6.3 | The astrazeneca controversy After the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine across the European Union, reports started coming in of concerns of thrombotic events after vaccine administration. These included reports of CVST and sinus venous thrombosis (SVT) accompanied by TP. This led to several countries halting vaccine administration. On March, 2021, shortly after rollout, Austria suspended 126 the use of a batch of of vaccines after two persons suffered blood clots after vaccination, one of whom died. 130 This was followed by several other countries suspending the use of the vaccine including Norway, Germany, Canada, France, Italy and the Netherlands. 131 By April, 2020, 169 cases of CVST and 53 cases of SVT were reported to EudraVigilance. 132 The European medical agency reaffirmed the safety of the vaccine while listing blood clots with TP as a rare side effect. 132 Following this, most countries resumed use of the vaccine while some restrained their use in younger individuals. The Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were an exception to this as they decided to permanently suspend the use of the vaccination.

Greinacher et al. 71 reported that in some patients, thromboses can develop at unusual sites such as the brain or abdomen, and clinical manifestations may become apparent 5 to 20 days after vaccination. If these manifestations are accompanied by TP, it may be an adverse effect of vaccination. Mehta et al. 84 recommend a plain CT and a CT venogram in suspected patients, along with laboratory work-up of coagulation factors and potential prothrombotic disorder work-up, such as antiphospholipid, ADAMTS13 and HIT and factor V Leiden, which would put the patient at an increased baseline risk of thrombosis. In the context of the similarity of post COVID-19 vaccination CSVT and HIT, it is recommended to perform a PF4 antibody ELISA, and Schultz, et al. 72 recommended that physicians should have a low threshold for requesting ELISA. As far as management, the authors recommend avoiding heparin products in all forms, favoring instead the administration of IVIG. Meanwhile, many studies did not recommend altering vaccination programs in the context of reports of cases of incidental thromboses. 23,25 Furthermore, Pawlowski, et al. 24 reported that none of the COVID-19 vaccines has been associated with a statistically significant increased relative risk of CVST in the Mayo Clinic Health System. Mehta et al. reported that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks. Furthermore, the risk of thrombosis with COVID-19 infection itself is high, especially if admitted to intensive care, highlighting further benefits of vaccination.",
