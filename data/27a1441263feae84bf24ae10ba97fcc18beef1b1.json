Methods: Previously developed models were adapted for 110 countries to include a status quo or \"no delay\" scenario and a \"1-year delay\" scenario assuming significant disruption in interventions (screening, diagnosis and treatment) in the year 2020. Annual, country-level, model outcomes were extracted, and weighted averages were used to calculate regional (WHO and World Bank Income Group) and global estimates from 2020 to 2030.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the incremental change in hepatitis C liver-related deaths and liver cancer at a regional and global level, following a 1-year hiatus in hepatitis elimination program progress. Secondary objectives for the analysis included evaluating the incremental change in HCV diagnosis, treatment and new infections (indicators for hepatitis elimination) and to evaluate the impact of shorter delays (3-month or 6-month) on morbidity and mortality.

This event occurs at a critical moment in the context of hepatitis elimination, with only 10 years remaining to reach the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) targets by 2030. 3 Disruptions to hepatitis programming across the cascade of care have already been documented in Egypt and Italy, two countries with very different COVID-19 experiences, and are expected in many other countries. In February 2020, the Italian government enacted a law to conduct graduated birth cohort screening for hepatitis; however, as of May the implementation of these programs is still delayed. Meanwhile, in Egypt, all ongoing screening programs (including J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f screening of children, pregnant women, foreigners living in Egypt, and prisoners) were halted in March 2020, and the number of Ministry of Health affiliated HCV treatment and cirrhosis follow-up units operating regularly was reduced by more than 75% (unpublished data provided by Prof. Imam Waked).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "zero) patients were diagnosed or initiated on treatment in the year 2020.

This illustrates that further delays in elimination programming are likely to exacerbate already strained national and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f regional plans for hepatitis elimination. Most regions were not projected to reach any of the WHO targets under a \"1-year delay\" scenario, with only the HIC group projected to achieve the mortality targets.At this point in time, it is impossible to know how long treatment and programming delays will last, or if intermittent disruptions will become a \"new normal\". Even after programs formally resume, patients may be reluctant to access healthcare services due to fear of contracting COVID-19 in those settings. To allow for even comparisons across regions, delays were assumed to occur uniformly within a scenario (i.e. in the 1-year delay scenario, we assume every country in the world simultaneously experiences a 1-year hiatus in programming). This analysis suggests that if a delay in programming and treatment occurs globally, the majority of missed treatments would be in LMIC. Although not all LMIC are experiencing or responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the same way, access to treatment and care have still been impacted. For example, although Egypt has not imposed a strict lockdown, Ministry of Health-sponsored HCV management centers have experienced a 50% reduction in new patients and monthly visits, in addition to temporarily suspended screening programs (unpublished data provided by Prof. Imam Waked). To account for differences in COVID-19 response and duration of response, data are presented by delay intervals (3-month, 6-month, and 1-year) and separately by the regional level (1-year delay) where outbreak responses are more likely to be similar. These provide decision makers with an array of options when considering how best to recover from delayed treatment.Additionally, most excess incident HCV infections would occur in LMIC. This poses a significant challenge, as incident infections are unlikely to be diagnosed for decades, meaning that elimination efforts beyond 2030 may be necessary. One interesting finding was that the American Region (AMR) is not expected to see a large number of incremental incident J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 infections as a result of delayed treatment. These estimates are largely driven by treatment restrictions in the USA, which prevent access to treatment for people who inject drugs (PWID) in many states.13 As a result, the disruption in diagnosis and treatment modeled here does not result in an increase in incident cases for the USA.LimitationsA few limitations exist in our analysis and are described here. First, the number of excess incident HCV infections was calculated on the basis of delayed diagnosis and treatment programs and does not include the impact of increased risk behaviors (for example the impact of the economic crisis on drug or alcohol use) or delayed access to harm reduction. Including disruptions to harm reduction programs and changing patterns of substance use would likely increase the number of incremental incident infections seen in HIC.
