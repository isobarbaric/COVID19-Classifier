The disease was first recorded in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Due to the high transmissibility of the virus and the insufficiency of effective containment measures, there was a rapid spread of the epidemic, first in China and then in other countries. The first case in Latin America was confirmed in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo on February 25. Two weeks later, the disease was classified as a pandemic by the WHO when it had already spread to at least 113 countries besides Brazil (WHO, 2020) ."

Furtado et al. (2020) evaluated the evolution of the clinical picture of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19 with the addition of AZI to the standard treatment. As a result, no benefit of adding the drug was found in clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is emphasized that as the AZI does not have a role in treating COVID-19, avoiding its use to treat this disease would reduce the unnecessary consumption of antibiotics.

It is a highly lipophilic substance that dissolves in most organic solvents, but it is practically insoluble in water (0.0004% m v \u2212 1 ). It has exceptional potency against endo and ectoparasites (mites and nematodes) at low dosis rates, typically expressed as \u00b5g.kg-1 (Lumaret et al., 2012) ."

The authors attribute the drop to the inhibition of nuclear import mediated by the viral proteins IMP\u03b1/\u03b21. The Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) points out that in vitro studies are used in the preliminary stages of drug development. However, the behavior of drugs in isolated cells is different from that observed in living organisms and, therefore, in vitro studies cannot be directly extrapolated for use in humans. In addition, further trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of IVM for human use against COVID-19 to determine its preventive or therapeutic use (Heidary and Gharebaghi, 2020) ."

(Farias et al., 2020) . Zurita et al. (2005) evaluated the acute effects of CQ by researching four ecotoxicological model systems. According to the results obtained, the authors recommend that, following the European Union directive for classification, packaging, and labeling of hazardous substances by the Commission Directive (2001), the CQ should be classified as \"R52/53: Harmful to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment\". CQ was related to increased chromosomal aberrations (Sahu; Kashyap, 2012) . Regarding environmental toxicity, data for HCQ are still scarce.

The use of direct photolysis (DP) in solutions containing HCQ showed results between 40 and 100% degradation Dabi\u0107 et al., 2019) . Bensalah et al. (2020) , using UVC lamp mercury (\u03bb = 254 nm, 15 W), found 40% HCQ degradation after 240 min of a 125 mg L \u2212 1 HCQ solution with pH = 7.1 and a temperature of 25 \u2022 C. The low degradation of HCQ obtained during DP was attributed to the low formation of HO \u2022 radicals and other oxidizing agents. Dabi\u0107 et al., (2019) performed the photolytic degradation of HCQ using simulated solar radiation as a radiation source and showed that pH values significantly affect HCQ degradation. Regarding the evaluated conditions, the best results are achieved under alkaline pH values, as shown in Fig. 7 .a. For the total degradation of HCQ, the study showed that it took 40 min at pH = 9, test time = 22 h at pH = 7. However, when a solution at pH = 4 was used, complete degradation was not achieved even after 52 h of testing. Faster photodegradation in alkaline solution indicates that deprotonation increases the electron density on HCQ, favoring the electrophilic attack of reactive oxygen species, such as HO \u2022 radicals."

After the degradation of AZI, several by-products were detected, indicating that the mineralization is not as deep, which is a major problem to be solved, evaluated and optimized in photomediated processes, as there may be a possible increase in the toxicity of the solution due to these compounds. When using river water + 20 \u00b5g L \u2212 1 of AZI as an aqueous matrix and natural solar radiation, 70% degradation of AZI was observed after 9 days of treatment. Voigt and Jaeger (2017) , in studies of AZI degradation using polychromatic UVC light source, showed that at pH = 3 and treatment time = 10 min, the degradation of AZI achieved was 80%. Tong et al. (2011) and Voigt, Jaeger (2017) observed the formation of several degradation by-products, which indicates that despite high values of degradation of AZI, the mineralization process is not deep when using DP. This behavior may be due to the non-formation of highly oxidizing species as, for example, HO \u2022 radicals. De la Cruz et al. (2012) , in studies of the degradation of 32 emerging contaminants, one of them being AZI with [AZI] = 295 ng L \u2212 1 , showed that the DP process using UVC radiation for 10 min and pH = 7.72 did not degrade the AZI molecule, that is, 0% degradation. The non-degradation of AZI was attributed to the dissolved organic matter in the aqueous matrix of domestic wastewater effluent that acted as a scavenger of radicals generated during indirect DP."

Cano et al.

However, the mineralization of the system achieved was \u2248 50% which indicates that despite almost complete degradation of AZI, PA generates a large formation of by-products and does not provide total mineralization. Shokri et al. (2020) , in studies of AZI degradation through the PA process, indicate that AZI concentration is the parameter that has the greatest influence during the PA process, the concentration being inversely proportional to degradation (Fig. 8.b) . The H 2 O 2 concentration had the least effect on the efficiency of PA. The greatest degradation of AZI was 76% and achieved with [H 2 O 2 ] = 10 mg L \u2212 1 , [AZI] = 2 mg L \u2212 1 , contact time 30 min and pH = 3.

Research has been developed to solve this problem by using natural sources of irradiation, originating the photoelectron-Fenton process with sunlight (SPEF) (Murrieta et al., 2020; P\u00e9rez et al., 2017) . Bensalah et al. (2020) used EO using BDD anode and its combination with UV irradiation in HCQ degradation. EO showed that despite the total degradation of HCQ in all experimental conditions tested (Fig. 11 . a), the mineralization did not show the same decay rate. This behavior indicates that HCQ degradation using EO occurs in more than one step leading to the formation of organic intermediates. When using UV radiation associated with EO to increase the formation of oxidizing species (HO \u2022 radicals), it is observed that there is lower energy consumption in addition to the increase in the rate of degradation and mineralization of HCQ the EO process."

Ultrasound radiation, when in contact with an aqueous matrix, causes the formation of microbubbles or cavities that, throughout the irradiation process increasing in size, in resonance with the frequency of radiation until it collapses violently. The collapse of the microbubbles induces the formation of points with pressure and temperatures close to 1000 atm and 5000 K, respectively.

Satisfactory results in the production of drinkable water were only obtained using the ozone process such as at Flemish Water Supply Company (VMW) in Kluizen (Belgium) where biostability increased, less chlorination was needed and significantly less chlorination water quality improved were observed (Audenaert et al., 2010) . Therefore, considering the capacity to generate highly oxidizing radicals, the ozone process currently presents the greatest potential when the objective is to degrade AZI, IMV, HCQ and CQ for the full-scale production of drinkable water."

Studies that combine greater removal efficiencies of these drugs with the feasibility of application on real scales are critical, aiming to preserve the environment, safety, and population health. In addition, health authorities must intensify and promote measures known to effectively control the disease: vaccination, social distancing, use of masks, and sanitary hygiene protocols. Aiming at scalability for the full-scale production of drinkable water targeting at the degradation of AZI, IMV, HCQ and CQ all the processes presented above must be improved, with the exception of the ozone process in which satisfactory results have already been achieved in the degradation of complex organic compounds. The improvement involves the discovery/research/modification in the materials/catalysts/electrodes used for the generation of HO \u2022 radicals coupling as a pre-or posttreatment with drinking water conventional processes."
