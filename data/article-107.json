            "text": "COVID-19 is a new emerging disease that started in 2019 and spread world wide to become a pandemic disease in 2020. Typically, the disease affects the respiratory system and patients suffering of COVID 19 present with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Nevertheless, affected patients may be asymptomatic or may present due to diseases in other organs like the heart or the eye. (1, 2) Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that results from thrombosis of the brain's venous channels. Multiple factors were implanted as a causative agent, either separated or in combination. These include hyper-coagulable state, trauma and surgery, sinusitis, and medications like oral contraceptives. Patients may present with headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, or focal neurological deficit. CVT is diagnosed depending on clinical presentation and imaging studies like computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical laboratory studies are useful for determining the possible causes of CVT. Treatment of CVT involves anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy and the treatment of the underlying cause. (3) The incidence of CVT in COVID-19 patients remains unknown. The underlying mechanism of CVT in COVID-19 patients remains debatable. It has been proposed that COVID-19 may induce a prothrombotic state, as supported by the elevated levels of factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and circulating prothrombotic microparticles such as antiphospholipid antibodies. It has been found that the concomitant CVT infection and COVID-19 seem to portend a much poorer prognosis than each condition individually. (4)"

She was referred from another hospital after her swab for SARS-CoV-2 appeared positive. Her referral paper claimed that the patient was admitted due to a stroke experienced before two days. The patient claimed that she complained of headache, left side weakness, and slurred speech on further questioning. Thus, she was admitted as a case of acute stroke and a COVID-19 swab was done routinely for screening on admission. Details on the patient management in that facility were unknown. The patient denied any past medical history."

The patient's vital signs showed a blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a temperature of 36.8 C, and an oxygen saturation of 99 % on room air. Her chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation on neurological examination. The cranial nerves and the motor examination were intact and normal coordination was observed. The patient had left upper limb numbness and some slurred speech. The patient's blood tests were unremarkable. Her chest CT showed a right lower lobe subpleural consolidation related to COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). The patient's brain CT showed right thalamus and right temporal lobe hypodensity (possible infarction) ( Figure 2) . Therefore, the medical on-call was consulted; he reviewed the patient and admitted him. COVID-19 protocol was started and the neurologist was consulted. The neurologist arranged for a brain MRI. The MRI showed features of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and right thalamic lesion with features suggestive of right thalamus venous infarction (Figure 3 & 4) . Additionally, CT angiography of the head and the neck was requested and showed evidence of filling defect/thrombosis in the straight sinus, right transverse, and sigmoid sinus ( Figure 5 & 6) ."
