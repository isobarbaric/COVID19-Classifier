[180] proposed a real-time, invisible, and secured protection method based on biometric fingerprint, further used in the recognition process for allegation ownership. This technique achieved a higher level of robustness against various attacks. Dalila Cherifi et al. [8] proved that brain MRI could be used as Security Biometrics (Hidden Biometrics), which is considered as a very robust anti-spoofing form, based on the extracted features from the brain MR images form what is called \"Brainprint,\" or \"Brain code,\" which can be used as a signature for recognition purposes. As shown in Fig. 2 , many kinds of attacks can affect medical images during transmission via eHealth networks. The definition of Attacks on secured images is different from normal attacks on any transmitted data. Attacks here are not to get information from ciphers but to pollute data and deform the secured media. These are classified into geometric attacks [132] like scaling, rotation, translation, cropping, and stretching. Signal processing attacks [104, 165] as histogram equalization (HE) [192] , contrast adjustment (CA), gamma correction (GA), and adaptive histogram. On the other side, image filtering [200] , such as median, average, and Sobel filters, are examples of denoising attacks. Additionally, image compression techniques are other kinds of signal processing attacks as JPEG compression. Some of these attacks are shown in Table 1 .",

Most cryptographic techniques, such as Blowfish, DES, AES, and RSA guarantee a maximum level of privacy. The hybridization of these methods is also used to accomplish maximum security. While these techniques are essential to encrypting text data, they are inefficient for image security since images have essential features, such as numerous redundancies and a potent correlation between neighboring pixels.

A secure stego-key is used to prevent intruders and is essential to having the ability to resist any image transformations techniques that can modify or change the covered data [82] . Sathua et al. [149] mentioned that the image consists of numbers in a twodimensional array from a computer's point of view. These numbers represent light depth at different locations and are called pixels. The images are commonly stored in 8-bit or 24-bit format. The higher the number of bits, the higher its capacity; therefore, 24-bit images own the highest capacity for hiding sensitive data as a pixel expressed in 16,777,216 color values, as explained by Muhammad et al. [119] . Hence, image steganography uses the redundant bits in altering data without deforming the original image features. A reversible information hiding technique is proposed in [2] to preserve the visual quality of color medical images. ",

This method can select random adaptive pixels based on the cover image and select pixels with a more considerable standard deviation value for each block individually. Hajduk and Levick\u00fd [60] also demonstrated that a global statistical characteristic was evaluated before interacting with the image coefficients. This statistical coefficient's importance is for finding areas in the cover image that can be altered without image deformation. Hence, being able to neglect smooth areas that have similar coloring. This process means that images with a combination of colors are excellent for adaptive steganography techniques. Liao et al.

These techniques are mainly based on detecting the target region for hiding sensitive information using the transform or spatial domain techniques explained previously. Accordingly, researchers are working on this point to enhance the imperceptibility using various directions. Several examples of these directions are quad-tree segmentation used to detect smooth areas appropriate for covering data with minor distortions in the image [66] . The author here [109] defined just noticeable differences in the (JND) technique to precept changes while embedding process.

Then, the master and ownership share operator is created to ensure distinguishability and robustness, especially against geometric attacks. The proposed algorithm was applied to 200 different medical images of five types. The experimental results show that the DRZW algorithm ensures the reliability and accuracy of authentication. This paper [55] proposed a new medical image watermarking approach based on redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and multiple histogram modification (MHM). To enhance the embedding capacity, the authors used the MHM algorithm.

In local features, the processing is performed on each pixel as GLCM, SIFT, SURF [142] , and Local binary Pattern and the ability of each technique to resist attacks. Hosny et al. [69] proposed highly accurate, fast, and robust techniques for gray and color images based on computing the moments of (PCET) for the host image. The results proved that the proposed algorithm gives higher accuracy for watermarked image reconstruction with high visual imperceptibility and robustness to common attacks. Hosny et al.

Medical image security plays a significant role in various eHealth applications, including storage, retrieval, identity theft, and data management. In this paper, we have introduced the latest development of medical image security algorithms in recent five years and analyzed the challenges of medical images security. Some famous image attacks have been listed, which are applied to data to test the proposed algorithms. Some medical image security approaches as cryptography which is presented in spatial and frequency domains, a detailed classification of steganography are presented, and several steganography approaches have been discussed, also a comprehensive survey for watermarking types, characteristics, and medical image watermarking approaches. We have discussed these approaches and their characteristics, kinds, requirements, working mechanisms for each approach, and their potential issues to support further research in this area. Also, some medical images datasets utilized by many researchers have been mentioned. Furthermore, some performance metrics for algorithm evaluation have been demonstrated. With the help of our survey, researchers may propose new security methodologies to secure the transmission of medical data to service eHealth applications (Tables 9 and 10). ",
