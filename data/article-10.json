This technique achieved a higher level of robustness against various attacks. Dalila Cherifi et al. [8] proved that brain MRI could be used as Security Biometrics (Hidden Biometrics), which is considered as a very robust anti-spoofing form, based on the extracted features from the brain MR images form what is called \"Brainprint,\" or \"Brain code,\" which can be used as a signature for recognition purposes. As shown in Fig. 2 , many kinds of attacks can affect medical images during transmission via eHealth networks. The definition of Attacks on secured images is different from normal attacks on any transmitted data. Attacks here are not to get information from ciphers but to pollute data and deform the secured media. These are classified into geometric attacks [132] like scaling, rotation, translation, cropping, and stretching. Signal processing attacks [104, 165] as histogram equalization (HE) [192] , contrast adjustment (CA), gamma correction (GA), and adaptive histogram. On the other side, image filtering [200] , such as median, average, and Sobel filters, are examples of denoising attacks. Additionally, image compression techniques are other kinds of signal processing attacks as JPEG compression. Some of these attacks are shown in Table 1 ."

It provides data encryption techniques so that only the person who has the decryption key can decode the encrypted message. It benefits in preventing any changes or updates by an assailant in the communication medium. It is accomplished using hash functions and a public-key cipher. Most cryptographic techniques, such as Blowfish, DES, AES, and RSA guarantee a maximum level of privacy. The hybridization of these methods is also used to accomplish maximum security. While these techniques are essential to encrypting text data, they are inefficient for image security since images have essential features, such as numerous redundancies and a potent correlation between neighboring pixels.

At first, the key is generated by applying the chaotic map technique to the medical image. Secondly, both row-by-row and column-bycolumn confusion is executed. Furthermore, the diffusion process is performed using binary reverse and complement operation. Diffused images and chaotic key images are XORed. The proposed system security level is measured by applying different attacks. Simulation results indicate that the developed cryptosystem has to satisfy the requirements of IoT healthcare applications. Harshitha et al. [64] proposed an image encryption technique for medical images based on a chaotic logistic map and linear feedback shift register to generate pseudo-random sequences, then XORing these sequences to construct the key used for encryption generate cipher medical image data. The proposed scheme is robust to various attacks and secures many formats of medical images. Pak and Huang [128] proposed a technique that cures the issue in a single chaotic map. In [84] , the authors proposed a new image encryption algorithm for both gray and colored medical images, wherein the proposed algorithm surpassed other existing encryption methods."

It treats various methodologies of embedding secret data like video, image, audio, text, or files into other multimedia payloads using the private key. The concealed information is called a secret message, and the container in which the secrete file is embedded is called a cover file.

A secure stego-key is used to prevent intruders and is essential to having the ability to resist any image transformations techniques that can modify or change the covered data [82] . Sathua et al. [149] mentioned that the image consists of numbers in a twodimensional array from a computer's point of view. These numbers represent light depth at different locations and are called pixels. The images are commonly stored in 8-bit or 24-bit format. The higher the number of bits, the higher its capacity; therefore, 24-bit images own the highest capacity for hiding sensitive data as a pixel expressed in 16,777,216 color values, as explained by Muhammad et al. [119] . Hence, image steganography uses the redundant bits in altering data without deforming the original image features. A reversible information hiding technique is proposed in [2] to preserve the visual quality of color medical images. "

The requirements are affected by changing the cover image pixels after embedding process secrets. In recently proposed steganography techniques, slight changing of the cover image after embedding while preserving payload capacity, which indicates a high steganography algorithm, has been used to indicate higher stego-image quality and lower message detectability. The embedding efficiency indicates the ratio of changed cover images pixels by calculating the number of embedded bits per embedding change.

An adaptive method is an entire case of transforms and spatial methods. This method can select random adaptive pixels based on the cover image and select pixels with a more considerable standard deviation value for each block individually. Hajduk and Levick\u00fd [60] also demonstrated that a global statistical characteristic was evaluated before interacting with the image coefficients. This statistical coefficient's importance is for finding areas in the cover image that can be altered without image deformation. Hence, being able to neglect smooth areas that have similar coloring. This process means that images with a combination of colors are excellent for adaptive steganography techniques. Liao et al. [102] proposed two payload allocation methodologies based on distortion distribution (ES-DD) and image texture complexity (ES-ITC) to investigate payload distribution in images steganography. Experimental results proved that the proposed methodologies could perform better in multiple image steganography but not on JPEG images."

HVS enhances the understanding of images, as the human vision has challenges in recognizing the finest details of image backgrounds. HVS has the primary advantage as it is indistinguishable, even if an intensive payload is embedded in edge regions and complex textures [100] . These techniques are mainly based on detecting the target region for hiding sensitive information using the transform or spatial domain techniques explained previously. Accordingly, researchers are working on this point to enhance the imperceptibility using various directions. Several examples of these directions are quad-tree segmentation used to detect smooth areas appropriate for covering data with minor distortions in the image [66] . The author here [109] defined just noticeable differences in the (JND) technique to precept changes while embedding process. It was observed that this category would adopt the embedding payload capacity without distorting the stego image; hence, detecting whether the image is covered or not by the intruder's naked eye is very challenging. However, the embedding can be revealed using statistical analysis."

Therefore, to guarantee originality and control disintegrate, watermarking is being used to publicize medical data security. Watermarking technique overcomes steganography's limitations by inserting a watermark inside the cover image such that the embedded watermark cannot be discovered [176] . However, the embedding process should not affect the image's visual quality.Digital watermarking techniques are derived from steganography, the science of communicating information while hiding its existence. The watermark is embedded in the host media so that it can't be separated from the data. Thus, by using watermarking, the work is still available but watermarked [118] ."

Firstly, features are extracted from the medical image using DRZW, based on the completed local binary pattern (CLBP) to ensure robustness against geometric attacks and distinguishability. Then, the master and ownership share operator is created to ensure distinguishability and robustness, especially against geometric attacks. The proposed algorithm was applied to 200 different medical images of five types. The experimental results show that the DRZW algorithm ensures the reliability and accuracy of authentication. This paper [55] proposed a new medical image watermarking approach based on redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and multiple histogram modification (MHM). To enhance the embedding capacity, the authors used the MHM algorithm. Then the watermark is embedded in the RDWT coefficients, which has several sub-band that provides better embedding capacity and guarantee its visual quality. The testing results proved that the proposed scheme presents better embedding capacity and robustness."

The scrambled watermark embedded in DCT proper coefficients were selected based on WDs. The proposed technique improves the robustness against different attacks compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Soualmi et al. [167] proposed a new watermarking scheme for medical image security based on MinEigen value features, chaotic sequence, and Quantization Index Modulation (QIM). Then embed the watermark bits in 3 \u00d7 3 blocks selected by using MinEigen value. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach is robust and imperceptible against compression attacks. In this work, [46] , the authors proposed a hybrid image quality degree algorithm based on singular value decomposition (M-SVD) for both grey and color images. The proposed algorithm embeds a watermark in the medical image then applies several geometric and image processing attacks. Results show that the M-SVD algorithm has perfect results in medical images in both color and grey images."

The widespread image aspect measurements are peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), bit correct ratio (BCR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and standard dynamic range (SDR). Despite signal fidelity, metrics are often disputed because they have no regard for the image signal's nature. They are still widely used as image quality measures [193] .

            "text": "In some applications, preserving image quality is a must because it may lead to medical images diagnosis or military data transmission. Simple distortion in the image is acceptable by taking a watermarking approach, for example, selecting a watermarking technique. Fragile, blind, robust, and zero-watermarking would be used according to the application. Most sensitive image applications use zero-watermarking for security because zero-watermarking was considered one of the approaches that don't cause image distortion ratio. The watermark does not embed inside the host image, as most traditional watermarking techniques do."

            "text": "The primary step for zero-watermarking is how to extract special and robust image features, robust against various image attacks, to reconstruct the watermark and verify copyright. In [80, 144] , the authors discussed various global and local features. In global features, the processing is performed on whole host image pixels, as Geometric Moment Features, Space-Time Volumes (STV). In local features, the processing is performed on each pixel as GLCM, SIFT, SURF [142] , and Local binary Pattern and the ability of each technique to resist attacks. Hosny et al. [69] proposed highly accurate, fast, and robust techniques for gray and color images based on computing the moments of (PCET) for the host image. The results proved that the proposed algorithm gives higher accuracy for watermarked image reconstruction with high visual imperceptibility and robustness to common attacks. Hosny et al. [68] proposed a robust watermarking algorithm based on new fractional-order exponent moments applied on color images."

Medical image security plays a significant role in various eHealth applications, including storage, retrieval, identity theft, and data management. In this paper, we have introduced the latest development of medical image security algorithms in recent five years and analyzed the challenges of medical images security. Some famous image attacks have been listed, which are applied to data to test the proposed algorithms. Some medical image security approaches as cryptography which is presented in spatial and frequency domains, a detailed classification of steganography are presented, and several steganography approaches have been discussed, also a comprehensive survey for watermarking types, characteristics, and medical image watermarking approaches. We have discussed these approaches and their characteristics, kinds, requirements, working mechanisms for each approach, and their potential issues to support further research in this area. Also, some medical images datasets utilized by many researchers have been mentioned. Furthermore, some performance metrics for algorithm evaluation have been demonstrated. With the help of our survey, researchers may propose new security methodologies to secure the transmission of medical data to service eHealth applications (Tables 9 and 10). "
