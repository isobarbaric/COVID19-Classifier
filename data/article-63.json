Neuroinflammation is associated with progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions along with dysregulation in emotions. Counteracting the sedentarism enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic through suitable indoors activities and intake of healthy food is likely to protect against or revert physiological impairments that may affect people retreating to their homes during the current crisis, eventually restoring physical and mental health. Imbalance of gut microbial structure is associated with intestinal injury allowing bacterial endotoxins to get access to the blood stream and remotely affect several organs including the brain resulting in psychological and cognitive alterations. 5, 6 The lethality associated with the evolving COVID-19 crisis has forced most governments to enforce strict social distancing measures in order to minimize chances of infection transmission. 4, 7 These lockdown measures largely require citizens to stay at home and avoid going out except for buying foods and medicines or performing very vital work activities. 8 Staying at home entails a remarkable decrease in the level of physical activity among a large sector of the population in most communities due to a significant increase in sedentary behaviors, 9 which pertain to stopping work temporarily or working online; having lower chances for walking and exercising e.g., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f on the streets or in public parks; and allocating more time for social media and television (TV) viewing, which are commonly accompanied by eating not related to hunger. 10, 11 In fact, longitudinal data from China indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak is associated with prolonged sleeping time and decreased physical activity among young groups (< 35 years). 12 Depression, anxiety, distress, and fear constitute most COVID-19-related emotional responses, which may result in emotional dysregulation and negative social behaviors. 4, 13 Dysfunctional emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use) and poor quality of life. 14 A recent systematic review shows that fear of contacting viral infections and social isolation associated with the tight social distancing measures heighten emotional negativity and feelings of loneliness, eventually increasing the risk for suicide among people witnessing great pandemics such as SARS-CoV 2002. 13 In addition to economic recession, lack of resources (e.g., food supply), lack of emotional support associated with distancing measures, 4 we believe that lack of physical activity associated with staying at home during the current pandemic may considerably, in part, heighten emotional negativity in a manner that may alter body immunity and increase the risk for contacting COVID-19 infection."

AMPK and Nrf2 regulate cellular activities involved in the cleavage of free radicals, production of internal antioxidants, activation of autophagy, regulation of metabolism, and DNA repair resulting in better tolerance to constant changes and higher resilience to environmental aggressions such as virulent infections. 7 Hence, lack of physical activity deprives the body of the resilience granted by the detoxifying effects of AMPK and Nrf2, which entails an increased likelihood for developing pathologies that underlie various diseases such as immunosuppression 4, 7 -essential for the development of In this regard, a meta-analytic review 4 and physical inactivity. 11 On the other hand, engaging in organized physical activity is documented to reduce anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and aggression in people with dementia, who express age-related reduction in the levels of physical activity. 10 Based on the aforementioned background, physical inactivity may alter body composition (increasing fat mass) in a fashion that promotes the development of emotional negativity. Therefore, efforts directed toward the enhancement of mental health during the current pandemic should discourage physical inactivity, especially in highly distressed individuals. Participating in a regular, structured physical activity indoors may be a multidimensional strategy to revert alterations in gut J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f microbiota, body composition, and mood that result from prolonged home stay imposed by the COVID-19 crisis. 4 Dietary modifications that involve less intake of high-caloric food and increased consumption of low glycemic-index foods or going on dietary restriction may complement the effect of exercise both on body composition, physical health, and on mental status. 4 "

Schematic illustration relating staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic to sedentary behaviors resulting in gut microbiome alteration, heightened inflammation, weight gain and negative mood.Physical inactivity may contribute to negative moods via several facets. On one hand, sedentary life-style may affect mental health by reshaping the structure of resident gut microflora,4,15 which drastically shift to obesogenic colonization patterns resulting in increased production of inflammation markers and free radicals, 7 which play a major role in the development of mental disorders (e.g., depression) as well as physical disorders (e.g., insulin resistance and obesity), which are further gene uncover significant differences in 11 gut genera between sedentary and active women. The latter express higher abundance of bacterial species that promote healthy functioning of the host such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis and Akkermansia muciniphila, which correlate with key indices of body composition such as body fat percentage and muscle mass.4 Alterations in the adipokine profile prompt adipose tissue dysfunctions to activate macrophages and increase the release of cytokines resulting in a chronic state of inflammation.4, 19   Among physiological affected by this scenario, glucose and lipid metabolism get strongly impaired as a result of decreased sensitivity of glucose uptake tissues to insulin as a result of the blocking effects of cytokines.4 Glycemic dysregulation induce the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through non-enzymatic binding of reducing sugars to cellular protein and lipid structures. AGEs accelerate inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress through their binding to several cell-surface receptors.6,7 Cumulative knowledge denotes a major effect of inflammation-induced by physical inactivity as well as by pathologies embroiled in various physical health conditions (including COVID-19)-in the development of depressive disorders.
