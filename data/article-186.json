            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than a hundred fifty million people and killed over three million people worldwide over the past year. During this period, different forecasting models have tried to forecast time path of COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike the COVID-19 forecasting literature based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling, in this paper new COVID-19 cases were modelled and forecasted by conditional variance and asymmetric effects employing Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH), Threshold GARCH (TARCH) and Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) models. ARMA, ARMA-GARCH, ARMA-TGARCH and ARMA-EGARCH models were employed for one-day ahead forecasting performance for April, 2021 and three waves of COVID-19 pandemic in nine most affected countries \u2500USA. ARMA-GARCH models have better forecast performance than ARMA models by modelling both the conditional heteroskedasticity and the heavy-tailed distributions of the daily growth rate of the new confirmed cases; asymmetric GARCH models have shown mixed results in terms of lower the root mean squared error (RMSE)."

United States of America (USA) and Brazil were the next epicenters in the world after the first wave in Europe. Unfortunately, nowadays, India is the pandemic's new epicenter of the world.

Such environment has made forecasting new COVID-19 cases or deaths an urgent and essential research area. Many researchers from different disciplines such as health, math, engineering, finance, economics have started to employ different forecasting techniques to get a better insight into spread of pandemic. Shinde et al. (2020) have categorized papers on COVID-19 forecasting into four categories by data and forecasting techniques: (i) big data (ii) social media/other communication media data (iii) stochastic theory/mathematical models and (iv) data science/machine learning techniques."

            "text": "Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is well-known time series forecasting methods especially in finance and economics. To forecast the spread of COVID-19, most of the researchers from different disciplines used ARIMA models because of their simplicity, systematic structure and acceptable forecasting performance (Wang et al., 2018) . As an early study, Ceylan (2020) used ARIMA models to forecast COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France between the period of 21/02/2020 and 15/04/2020. Since all series became stationary after the second difference, ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) were chosen by minimum MAPE value as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. The estimation period covers the all data and outof-sample period for the next 10-day was applied to forecast confirmed cases of COVID-19 in these countries. Petropoulos et al. (2020) attempted to predict the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cumulative number of deaths, using basic time series models, i.e. non-seasonal multiplicative error and multiplicative trend exponential smoothing model. They produced 12 rounds of 10-day-ahead non-overlapping forecasts, covering a four-month period from February to May 2020. Authors claim that their model results offer competitive forecast accuracy. Duan and Zhang (2020) predict the daily new confirmed cases in Japan and South Korea from 20/01/2020 until 26/05/2020 using ARIMA. ARIMA(6,1,7) and ARIMA(2,1,3) models were selected as best models for Japan and South Korea, respectively and the daily new confirmed cases for the 7-day period from April 27, 2020 to May 3, 2020 were predicted. Ribeiro et al. (2020) studied on short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states. ARIMA, cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR) and stacking-ensemble learning were used for one, three, and sixdays ahead forecasting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases. They ranked the models according to their forecasting ability based on sMAPE in all scenarios from the best to the worst, SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models, respectively. Maleki et al. (2020) modeled the total number of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world by the proposed autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models. TP-SMN-AR(7) model was selected as the best model for the estimation period from 22/01/2020 to 30/04/2020 for the total confirmed COVID-19 cases, and TP-SMN-AR(2) model was selected as the best model under the estimation period from 02/02/2020 to 30/04/2020 for the total recovered COVID-19 cases. The validation period was the last 10 days of the confirmed and recovered cases, i.e. 21/04/2020-30.04.2020. Maleki et al. (2020) claimed that proposed models improve the forecasting accuracy for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world. Malki et al. (2021) investigated the end of COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of second rebound using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, selected by AIC. Authors scaled the data using the min-max scalar function to stabilize the value of variance and improved the forecast ability of the model. The estimation period covers 70% of all data, i.e. from 22/01/2020 to 15/06/2020 and the validation period used to forecast for the next 60 days, i.e. from 15/06/2020 until 12/08/2020. Out-of-sample period starts from 13/08/2020 until 11/09/2020. Then Malki et al. (2021) try to estimate the expected deadline of COVID-19 for some countries in the first and second rebounds using the forecasted models based on normal distribution. Lastly, authors have compared the forecast performance of ARIMA, Machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning model (LSTM) and concluded that SARIMA model can be extended and used to predict confirmed cases of other countries. Talkhi et al. (2021) forecast the number of confirmed and death caused COVID-19 in Iran using nine different time series models, i.e. NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The daily confirmed and death cases data covers from 20/02/2020 until 15/08/2020 and splined train (70%) and testing part (30%), then the forecasting accuracy of the models is evaluated by RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The authors selected the ARIMA(1,0,0), i.e. AR(1), and ARIMA(1,0,1), i.e. AR(1), for confirmed and death cases, respectively. Out-of-sample period starts from 16/08/2020 until 14/09/2020 for 30 days. Empirical findings of the paper offer the MLP network model for confirmed cases forecasting and Holt-Winter model for forecasting death cases. Sahai et al. (2021) forecast daily confirmed cases for five most affected countries. ARIMA models estimated for the period of 15/02/2020-30/06/2020 and India (4,2,4), Brazil (3,1,2), Russia (3,0,0), Spain (4,2,4) and US (1,2,1) models selected by AIC. Actual data from 1st July to 18th July was used as validation period and the forecast efficiency was determined by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). MAPE was the lowest for Russia and Spain at 1.09% and 0.83%, and 3.70%,1.84% and 2.88% for India, Brazil and US, respectively."

Cumulative confirmed case data was used with different baseline date based on the first case was seen. They concluded that LSTM and ARIMA models had the best forecast performance. Katris (2021) investigated the estimation of the spread and the reversion of the pandemic from the beginning of the reported cases until August 14 of 2020. The Newbolt/Granger combination scheme of TES, ARIMA and ANN models were built to forecast the daily cases in Greece. Katris built alternative scenarios for the evolution of the pandemic using the model results and the log-normal distribution, which is the best-fit distribution to the data."

The first limitation is about data, and the second is about modelling. The paper has three data stages: Data period, data transformation and data cleaning. ARIMA model, which is further explained in the econometric model section, is a univariate linear regression model trying to find right coefficients for the lags of the dependent variable or residual terms based upon the historical returns or growth rates. Longer time period means better forecast ability for a model. Accordingly, the estimation period set in this paper is one-year period, from March 2020 to March 2021. Validation periods are one-day ahead forecast of the April, 2021 and three waves of COVID-19 pandemic."

Taking the first difference is a proper method of making a series stationary, but in case of COVID-19 pandemic, this would lead misspesification of the model. It is obvious that the number of daily new cases were low on the onset of the pandemic but the new cases reached over 200,000 in USA and India at the late stage of the pandemic or during the strong waves of the pandemic. The growth rate of the daily new COVID-19 cases (7 day smoothed) was used by taking the log difference of the series following the economics or finance literature."

Thus finding the best-fitted ARIMA model is the key part of the modelling, but when the data has outliers, these potential large deviations from mean can make parameter estimation or forecasting inappropriate. New COVID-19 cases have two outliers in USA and one outlier in Germany, so adjusted new cases are used for these outliers. On the other hand, Turkey, one of the fifth most effected country in the world, is excluded from the sample since new COVID-19 cases in Turkey has two structural breaks, which indicates that COVID-19 cases do not follow the natural trajectory of the pandemic spread. So the previous and/or future studies should take outliers in COVID-19 data and time path of the new cases into account."

            "text": "The second limitation is about modelling. In the literature which aim to forecast of new cases or deaths by using ARIMA, a mean equation is modelled under the assumption of homoscedasticity. ARIMA or mean equation indicates that the current value of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases is a linear function of its past values as well as current and previous residual series. However, financial returns show volatility clustering, as first noted by stating that \"large changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes.\". Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model usually has a better performance than traditional statistical methods like ARMA by capturing the non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series. Yet this paper differs from the literature, using ARMA-GARCH model. Moreover, the asymmetric characteristics in the volatility of new COVID-19 cases were modelled by using two most known asymmetric GARCH models \u2500 the Threshold GARCH (TARCH) Model and the Exponential GARCH (EGARCH)."

Thefore the paper analyzed the daily new confirmed cases, yet some issues arouse: First, for the US and Germany daily new cases showed some significant outliers. Reducing the unconditional variance is an important issue when modelling the pandemic spread since the new cases have an exponential growth characteristic in the early stage of the pandemic. As a first step, the 7 day smoothed series were used by taking 7 days moving average of the daily new confirmed cases. Some countries have included weekend lockdowns or national holiday lockdowns, consequently the cases show an irregular pattern for weekends or the days when there were legal COVID-19 restrictions. Using 7-day moving average helps to avoid this type of changes in the number of the COVID-19 cases. In other words, the forecasted value would be 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases. From now on when referring to models and estimation in this paper, \"new cases\" means daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) for the country , if otherwise noted. As the second step starting date is determined as the first day when the number of the new cases is over 100. This way it is to get rid of the early days exponential growth rates in new cases to some extent."

The first country, which passed the 100 new cases, is Italy on March, 1th, 2020 and the last one is India, which is now the second in the World in regards to total COVID-19 cases. Daily average of the growth rates is fluctuating between 1% -1.5%, the highest mean growth rate is 2.06% in India and the lowest one is 0.74% in UK thanks to vaccination. The maximum daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (7 day smoothed) is 107.94% in France and the minimum is again in France with -78.25%. Standard deviation is maximum in France with 0.1135 and minimum in Russia with 0.0453 and it provides a priori knowledge about considering heterogeneity in forecast models of this study. The kurtosis of the normal distribution is 3. Then all series have high kurtosis, the distribution is leptokurtic, that is, more peaked than a normal distribution with longer tails, especially for USA. It is an outcome of wild pandemic cycle periods, i.e. the effect of uncontrolled period and controlled period on growth rates of COVID-19 cases. Skewness is a measure of asymmetry and it is expected as zero under the normal distribution. All series have positive skewness implying that the distribution has a long right tail due to high growth rates of COVID-19 cases. Skewness is maximum in USA with 6.97 and minimum in France 0.65. The Jarque-Bera test statistic is calculated based on skewness and kurtosis values of the distribution, as expected it rejects the null hypothesis of a normal distribution for all series. High standard deviation and skewness&kurtosis values of the series indicate that our forecasting models should take non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series into account. It is known that ARMA models have constant variance assumption, which means volatility in new COVID-19 cases does not any effect on forecasted new cases. If data have heavy-tailed probability distribution, then GARCH procedure ensures modelling both the conditional heteroscedasticity and the heavy-tailed distributions of the daily growth rate of the new confirmed cases."

Forecasted value of the new confirmed cases (7 day smoothed) can be calculated using the forecasted growth rates obtained from two main models, i.e. ARMA(4,4) and ARMA(4,4)-GARCH(1,1) models (see Figure 3 ). It can be easily seen in Figure 3 that ignoring the conditional variance caused weak forecast power. Table 2 shows the statistical properties of deviations presented in Fig.4 . The mean of the deviations for 30 observations is 152 new cases for GARCH model but 471 new cases for ARMA model. It is clear that the maximum (3,504 for ARMA and 1,504 for GARCH) and the minimum (-3,522 for ARMA and -1,260 for GARCH) deviations from the actual ones are so high for ARMA model, which causes a high standard deviation for ARMA model. Under the null hypothesis of a normal distribution, Jarque-Bera test statistics confirm that both series have normal distribution, which also confirms that specifications of the models are built successfully."

            "text": "While a model has higher forecasting accuracy for normal periods, it is harder to forecast non-normal periods such as financial crisis, financial stress periods or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. Most of the countries faced three COVID-19 waves; first wave was at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, second wave was seen during the last months of the 2020 and third one was around March,2021. However, pandemic has its own growing path for most of the countries since its spread rate depends on so many variables such as age structure, health expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, population density, public measures and so on. Fig. 5 . COVID-19 waves (shaded areas) in nine most affected countries Figure 5 presents COVID-19 waves in the nine most affected countries. The waves were defined based on before and after 15 days of the local maximum of the new cases (smoothed). As seen in Figure 5 and Table 3 , the time periods of the waves have changed between countries; India has single wave while Russia has two waves. Table 3 shows the one-step ahead forecast model results in terms of RMSE for the first COVID-19 wave. The model results confirm the forecast results of April, 2021; all countries have lower RMSE when using the ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(1,1) model. Taking into account heteroscedasticity is an essential part for forecasting models. However, asymmetric effect has shown some mixed results as it did in baseline validation period, April 2021 (see Table 2 ). Some of the TGARCH or EGARCH models are better than GARCH models, for example while TGARCH works better for India and for Brazil, France, Russia, UK for both models work well; on the other hand, Italy, Spain and Germany have higher RMSE values, even higher than ARMA models in some cases 3 . Table 4 shows the second COVID-19 wave for eight countries. ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(1,1) models have still lower RMSE but not for all countries, France and UK have slightly lower RMSE under the ARMA models. Asymmetric GARCH Models have still mixed performance results. The model results for the third COVID-19 wave is presented in Table 5 . GARCH models have better performance accuracy for USA, Brazil and Germany in terms of RMSE, the loss of forecasting power is small for France, UK, Italy and strong for Spain. Including asymmetric effect into the variance equation creates higher RMSE for most of the countries."

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic has been in our lives for more than a year and there is a growing literature focusing on forecasting the parameters of pandemic spread such as total cases, new cases, mortality rates, spread rate and so on. Since COVID-19 pandemic is a multidisciplinary research area, many researchers from different disciplines have contributed to the literature using mathematical models or machine learning techniques. ARIMA models are well-known time series models to forecast univariate variables such as new COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, the main assumption behind the ARIMA models are that the expected variance of all error terms is the same at any given point, i.e. homoskedasticity assumption. However, COVID-19 pandemic has strong waves, which leads heavy-tailed distributions. GARCH models are able to capture the non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series. Asymmetric effect is another feature of GARCH-type models, i.e. TGARCH and EGARCH, by measuring the differential effects of negative or positive shocks on conditional variance."

Therefore, GARCH modelling is essential to capture non-lineraties in data and rising forecast accuracy. (ii) Most of the machine learning models such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines do not have restrictions or data transformation as did in time series models. Using packages in Python, R or similar programs also support this type of analysis, without noticing the data cleaning and data transformation. Before the modelling stage, we should make sure that input data is appropriate for this kind of modelling. (iii) Seasonal ARIMA models can be estimated for capturing the seasonality effect on the data. (iv) Three or seven days ahead forecasting can be employed to see longer forecasting performance of the models."
