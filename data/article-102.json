At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable.

For the Campania case, the median increase in fatalities is 1.1 and 2.4 additional fatalities per 100,000 for eruptions on day 1 and 100 respectively, and 60.0 additional fatalities per 100,000 for an eruption close to the peak in infections (day 50)."

Natural disasters can threaten the measures in place to reduce disease transmission [2] . Understanding how disease spread can be worsened by natural disasters will aid preparedness and response planning [3] . Although a small increase in risk of epidemic outbreak following natural disasters has been identified [2, 4] , very little is known about the spread of infection following a natural disaster during a pandemic such as Numerical modelling is an important tool for understanding and projecting the spread of infectious diseases [5, 6] , including COVID-19 [7] [8] [9] . A common approach is to divide a population up into susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased individuals [5, 6, 10] . More sophisticated models incorporate a larger number of different states (e.g. asymptomatic or seriously ill individuals [7] ;), and may account for other real world complications (e.g. age, vaccination campaigns, etc.)."

The deterministic approach is ill suited for simulation of small population sizes, heterogeneous populations and threshold behaviour [9, 11] . A stochastic, agentbased model structure may also be used [10, [12] [13] [14] , in which case the variation between runs allows for quantification of uncertainty [8, 14] .

This model builds on the basic susceptible, infected, recovered model structure to better account for the characteristics of COVID-19 [5, 6, 10] . Every cell in the model is either occupied by an individual, or by empty space (X e ). Each model individual may be in one of 7 states: susceptible (S), infected and mildly ill (I m ), infected and severely ill (I s ), infected and asymptomatic (I a ), recovered (R), or deceased (D). Empty space allows us to account for geographic factors such as spatially varying population density and the presence of cities. Individuals may also self-isolate or be quarantined. We base the definition of our states and model disease characteristics on COVID-19 data [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and our model space on real-world geospatial data. In geoSIR, the spread of the disease is initiated with the arrival of infected travellers [22] . The disease then spreads further through encounters between individuals within the model space. In each timestep, individuals make both close and distant encounters with other individuals. If either induvial is infected, they have a given probability of transmitting the infection to the other individual, which we parametrise based on available data for COVID-19 [20, 23] . We also ensure that resulting reproductive number R 0 (as calculated from eq. 6) are consistent with the range estimated for COVID-19 [15, 19, 24] ."

For the Campania model runs, we simulate the full 5.8 million inhabitants for 6 different scenarios. Due to the large population size in this scenario, we adapt the code to run on a 24 core Haswell E5-2680v3 processor node of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. One of these scenarios is comparable to reality, with no natural disaster and a lockdown implemented. We evaluate the results of it against real-world data from the wave of COVID-19 infections in spring 2020. The other five scenarios are counterfactual scenarios-one in which no natural disaster occurs but no lockdown is implemented, and the other four in which a natural disaster occurs on day 2, 25, 50 or 100 of the simulation. We use a real-world natural disaster, the eruption of Vesuvius. The key mitigation strategy for a volcanic eruption at Vesuvius is a timely evacuation [33, 34] , for which evacuation plans have been designed [29] . This disaster response results in widespread population displacement -a key risk factor in disease spread [2] ."

These scenarios cover various permutations of lockdown, natural disaster timing and natural disaster duration.

The scale of this increase depends on the relative timing of the natural disaster and peak in infection cases, and on the duration of the disaster (Fig. 2) . In the case with no natural disaster, the median number of infections is 4900 (IQR 41405,640) cases per 100,000 and the median number of deaths is 66 (IQR 53-76) per 100,000.

Campania had more than 4800 confirmed infections and 400 deaths [1] . Although the probability of Vesuvius erupting during the COVID-19 pandemic is low, the wealth of volcanic evacuation plans and COVID-19 data make it a valuable case study. The exact nature of the geological hazard is not of primary importance, rather the parameters of the evacuation and increased human contact following influence the progression of the infectious disease outbreak. The Campania results may be used to understand the effect of other disasters requiring widespread evacuation during a pandemic. Natural disasters have already occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic [36, 37] , and will occur during future infectious disease outbreaks. Cyclone Amphan made landfall in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India on May 20, 2020, prompting widespread evacuations.

All values are filtered with a 10 day moving mean to remove short period noise. The in the scenario with no eruption and a lockdown, model outputs are close to the observed real world data (a and g). Note that the model mean new daily cases appear artificially low due to different peak timings, but that the magnitude of individual runs are comparable to the real world outputs. The mean number of deaths is higher in all scenarios in which Vesuvius erupts (c and i, d and j, e and k, f and l), and higher by more than an order of magnitude where the eruption coincides with the peak in infections (e and k)"
