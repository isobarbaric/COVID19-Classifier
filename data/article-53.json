            "text": "A 22-item survey addressing four themes during the early pandemic (time on service, structured education, clinical training, future plans) was emailed to Society of Breast Imaging members and members-in-training in July 2020. Responses were compared using McNemar's and Mann-Whitney U tests; a general linear model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Of 136 responses (136/2824, 4.8%), 96 U.S. responses from radiologists with trainees, residents, and fellows were included. Clinical exposure declined during the early pandemic, with almost no medical students on service (66/67, 99%) and fewer clinical days for residents (78/89, 88%) and fellows (48/68, 71%). Conferences shifted to remote live format (57/78, 73%), with some canceled (15/78, 19%). Compared to pre-pandemic, resident diagnostic (75/78, 96% versus 26/78, 33%) (P<0.001) and procedural (73/78, 94% versus 21/78, 27%) (P<0.001) participation fell, as did fellow diagnostic (60/61, 98% versus 47/61, 77%) (P=0.001) and procedural (60/61, 98% versus 43/61, 70%) (P<0.001) participation.

However, a majority thought that decreased time on service (36/67, 54%) and patient contact (46/79, 58%) would not change residents' pursuit of a breast imaging fellowship."

The subspecialty of breast imaging is no exception, and the patientfacing nature of the field poses unique challenges to education and safe care delivery during the pandemic. The reduction of study and procedural volume during the height of the pandemic (1-2) complicates trainee education given the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) mammography interpretation regulations, which stipulate interpretation of 240 mammography studies in a 6 month period during the last two years of residency (3). These challenges are juxtaposed with the need to socially distance and limit personnel in small reading rooms, limited personal protective equipment, and, in some regions, the need to shift resources and personnel to other services for patient care (4) . While publications have discussed approaches to general radiology and breast imaging education during the pandemic (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , to date none to our knowledge have reported specifically how the pandemic has impacted breast imaging training and how trainees have experienced these changes. Therefore, this study was performed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast imaging education as it relates to medical students, radiology residents, and breast imaging fellows."

The survey was designed such that only the questions pertinent to the self-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t reported types of trainees at the respondent's practice were presented to each respondent (i.e. if a respondent's practice only trains medical students, only those questions pertinent to medical student education were presented). The working group iteratively developed the initial survey questions, and a draft survey was then field tested by the group members. Changes were made to the survey design, language, and organization based on feedback. The working group approved the final 22-item survey for distribution (see supplementary material)."

In particular, the pandemic resulted in a decline in clinical exposure for all trainees, and most respondents thought that both resident and fellow screening, diagnostic, and procedural education was somewhat negatively, negatively, or very negatively impacted by the pandemic. Even after flattening of the infection curve, several gaps in breast imaging education persisted, including medical student clinical exposure (38/66, 58% not allowed on service), resident involvement in diagnostic studies and interventional procedures (below baseline), resident readout (4/75, 5% no direct or real-time readout), and resident and fellow conferences (4/75, 5% canceled conferences). Fortunately, responses were less negative with respect to the future plans of trainees, as a majority of respondents thought that the decreased time on the breast imaging clinical service and the patient contact in breast imaging would not change residents' decisions to pursue a breast imaging fellowship.

Given that breast imaging is a patient-facing specialty, the latter step is critical to training."

Resident and fellow involvement in diagnostic studies and interventional procedures is a critical aspect of breast imaging education, and workflow should be adjusted to support this involvement, if safe to do so. The implementation of risk mitigation measures recommended by the American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging (20) (21) , such as screening patients for symptoms, rearranging reading rooms and imaging centers to allow for social distancing, and ensuring availability of appropriate personal protective equipment, should allow trainees to participate in ongoing breast imaging care. Interestingly, there was an association between resident and fellow procedural education and whether all of a respondent's breast centers remained open, with those who did not keep all breast centers open having less negative responses, on average, after adjusting for region and the presence of a stay-at-home order; a possible explanation for this might be that these respondents adjusted workflow and consolidated procedures at a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t central teaching site, allowing for higher teaching volumes than if the few remaining procedures were dispersed among multiple breast centers. With respect to remote readouts and conferences, there are several relatively inexpensive secure communications technologies available (6, (22) (23) (24) , and graduate medical education offices or information technology departments may already have resources for such remote communication. These technologies have benefits beyond the pandemic, particularly for multi-site institutions, as they allow faculty at different sites to more easily interact with and teach trainees. They also facilitate attendance to conferences that would otherwise be missed by some trainees due to location and timing, including tumor boards and multidisciplinary didactic conferences (12) . Finally, while a minority of our respondents reported changes to the methods used to comply with the MQSA mammography interpretation regulations, training programs should be cognizant of this educational requirement for the current academic year and encourage trainees to meet the requirement as soon as possible given the uncertainty surrounding rising and falling COVID-19 case rates. Respondents most commonly reported the double reading of current studies, which requires minimal changes to workflow to implement. Rereading previously interpreted studies may also serve as a readily available method, as teaching files, tumor board cases, and biopsy cases can be utilized."

The authors noted that the remote format did not allow students to see how cases \"unfold\" in the reading room, and students reported missing in- However, it should also be noted that the reported response rate is artificially low, as the survey was distributed to all Society of Breast Imaging members, including many without trainees; these members are presumably less likely to respond to an education-related survey. A minority of respondents were trainees, although the survey was not specifically designed for trainees. Given the anonymous nature of the survey, it is possible multiple respondents were from the same institution. Finally, in light of the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, including the heterogeneity of case rates in different regions over time, our results may not accurately reflect the impact on education in all regions."

Active participation examples provided to respondents included ultrasound scanning, discussion of diagnostic study results, consenting, and assistance with performing procedures.
