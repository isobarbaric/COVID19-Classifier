Figure 1C shows successful transfection of NSP15 (EN) in all five replicates, with NSP16 (ME) transfection showing expression in four replicates. Representative confocal immunofluorescence images in Supplementary Figure S1A ,B further verify spike S1 and S2 protein expression in the transfected HL-CZ cells which were stained orange with the corresponding S1 and S2 antibodies. Interestingly, both SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 exhibited predominant cytoplasmic localization similar to SARS-CoV spike expression in HL-CZ cells [15] .

The virus hijacks the ER to process its structural and nonstructural proteins-viral activities thus exert a profound impact upon the ER function of host cells [26, 27] . During coronavirus replication, substantial amounts of heavily modified transmembrane proteins, including spike protein, are generated. The accumulation of nascent and unfolded viral proteins in the ER lumen may rapidly overload the folding capacity of the ER, thereby perturbing normal cellular functions and causing ER stress [28] . ER stress activates multiple cell-signaling pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), to regulate gene expression to adjust the biosynthetic burden and capacity of the ER to maintain homeostasis [29] . When ER is severely damaged, the UPR triggers apoptosis [30, 31] . Interestingly, the related SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein can sufficiently induce transcriptional activation of UPR effectors [28] . Transcriptomics data identified activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), and dualspecificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) to be induced by SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus (HCoV) [32] [33] [34] . We observed that ATF3 (an UPR-regulated transcription factor) and DDIT3 (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) were also induced by both SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 subunits (Table 3) . ATF3 is a hub of the cellular adaptive-response network that connects multiple extracellular signals, such as ER stress, cytokines, chemokines, and lipopolysaccharide. ATF3 plays vital roles in modulating metabolism, immunity, and oncogenesis [35] . DDIT3 plays important roles in ER stress-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, bovine viral diarrhea virus infection induces high DDIT3 expression, which targets mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), leading to the inhibition of type I interferon and interferon-stimulated gene production, thereby promoting viral replication [36] . Although DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, it negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes virus-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in infected cells [37] , hence suggesting a possible role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infection by SARS-CoV-2."

HSPA1A, HSPA1B and HSPA6 are members of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, while DNAJB1 is a member of the HSP40 family. HSP70 and HSP40 co-operate to prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins [40] . Heat shock proteins are documented to protect against ER stress-induced apoptosis [41, 42] . Expression of HL-CZ cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 proteins were found to significantly up-regulate these HSP family members (Table 4) . Thus, the up-regulation of these heat shock proteins may represent the host's response to counter ER stress-induced apoptosis arising from viral infection. Intriguingly, intracellular HSP70 exerts anti-inflammatory effects, but this protein can be released as extracellular HSP70, which activates pro-inflammatory pathways instead [43] . Another heat shock protein, HSP90\u03b2 interacts with and stabilizes NP of MERS-CoV, and inhibition of HSP90 by RNA interference or by 17-AAG significantly suppresses MERS-CoV replication [44] . It is also noteworthy that HSPA1A and HSP90 are also significantly upregulated during SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells [45] ."

Type 2 interferon-gamma stimulation activates PI3-kinase and its effector kinase AKT, triggering JAK-STAT signaling and gene expression [46] . This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 subunit may possess immunomodulatory functions by blocking interferon signaling compared to its S1 counterpart, and that suppression of interferon by S2 may be crucial for viral replication. Interferon immunity plays an essential role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection [47] . SOCS3 is a potent and specific inhibitor of IL-6 signaling, and SOCS3 binds to JAKs to inhibit JAK activity [48] . RT-qPCR revealed significantly reduced SOCS3 mRNA in spike S2-expressing cells, implying enhanced IL-6 signaling which is a key part of the cytokine storm occurring in severe COVID-19. An aberrant STAT pathway is also proposed to be central to COVID-19 pathophysiology [49] . In addition, it has been documented that human macrophages can be activated by spike protein of the related SARS-CoV to induce TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 [50] ."

Thus, aberration of the adipocytokine signaling pathway caused by the spike S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to patients with underlying metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, who are at higher risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19 [58] . Adipocytokine dysfunction may lead to a specific immune environment that predisposes diabetic and obese patients to respiratory failure [59] . Krause et al.

This is consistent with a previous report that proteins associated with focal adhesion and interactions with the ECM receptors were all decreased in fresh lung tissues obtained from newly deceased patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [61] . This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to dysregulation of the extracellular microenvironment in the lung, revealing a potential mechanism of virus-related lung injury in severe COVID-19. During infection, it is estimated that 10-fold more NP protein may be produced in comparison with spike protein [62] . In COVID-19, it is also noteworthy that antibody responses to NP are elevated in deceased patients, whereas spike-specific antibody responses are enriched among convalescent patients [63] . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NP is proposed to interact with 15 human proteins, mainly associated with RNA processing or stress granule regulation [64] . We previously reported that SARS-CoV NP can induce actin reorganization and apoptosis in cells in the absence of growth factors [65] . SARS-CoV NP also interacts with host cyclin-CDK complex to regulate the cell cycle [66] , and it binds to translation elongation factor 1 alpha to inhibit proliferation of cells including lymphocytes [67] ."

Similarly, in our study, we showed the up-regulation of enriched genes associated with the perturbation of pathways of neurodegeneration in cells expressing NSP15 and NP ( Figures 6D, 8D , 9A and 9B). GSEA on gene expression data from tissues donated by idiopathic Parkinson disease (iPD) patients suggest the potential contribution of human coronaviruses in the pathogenesis of iPD [72] . In a case report, a patient whose first manifestations of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurred in tandem with symptomatic onset of COVID-19 led the authors to hypothesize that the cascade of systemic inflammatory mediators in response to the virus accelerated the pathogenesis of his prion disease [73] . Given the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, deeper investigation is warranted into the virus' contribution to the long-term development of neurodegenerative disease."

Such studies can enhance our understanding of the \"infectomics\" of viral infections in different human cell types, including monocytes and macrophages. To follow up on the RNA-Seq data, future detailed analyses of selected differently expressed genes and proteins of interest may be conducted by real-time RT-qPCR, Western blotting and other in vitro techniques, and by harnessing gene-knockout and other animal models to further investigate their specific functions in vivo during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mice expressing human ACE2 and challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can elucidate the latter's contribution to COVID-19 pathology [74] . Another strategy for transcriptomic and other analyses is to infect cells expressing human ACE2 receptor with lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins, e.g., spike glycoprotein [75] . Instead of expressing one viral protein at a time, combined expression of viral proteins may also yield useful insights into their synergistic roles [76] ."
