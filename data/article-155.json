Either thresholds or comparative evaluation are defined and monitored on a weekly basis by each region as part of the national integrated surveillance system. Indicators 1.1-1.6 are used for an initial assessment of the quality of the information collected. If a region has those indicators above threshold, it is automatically labeled as a high-risk region. Non-increase the number of active transmission outbreaks in the Region; Absence of transmission outbreaks on the regional territory for which a risk assessment was not quickly carried out and the opportunity to establish a sub-regional \"red zone\" evaluated If a region complies with the threshold, two algorithms are used in order to evaluate the epidemic probability risk and epidemic impact risk ( Figure 1A) . Indicators used to evaluate the probability risk range from 3.1 to 3.7, while indicators used to evaluate the impact risk range from 3.1 to 3.9 (5). A risk assessment matrix (RAM) based on the probability and impact risk defines the risk level as: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high ( Figure 1B ). An additional classification of the level of risk has been defined assuming four possible scenarios based on the reproductive number (Rt) ( Table 1 -indicator 3.2) as described in Figure 1C (3). For each region, the combination of RAM and the four possible scenarios defines the overall high, medium and low risk, which is color coded as red, orange, and yellow (2) (Figure 1D) . A region is considered red when the RAM is equal to very high risk or high risk and complies with Scenario 4; orange when the RAM is equal to very high risk or high risk and complies with Scenario 3; and yellow when it is in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, independently from the RAM results. From December 6 until December 12, the overall distribution of the Regions and Autonomous Provinces was as follows: 12 color-coded as yellow areas, eight color-coded as orange areas, and one as red area."
