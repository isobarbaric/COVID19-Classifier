PIU is increasingly recognized as disproportionately impacting young people and represents an emerging mental health research challenge (2) . Excessive social media use, online streaming, gaming, gambling, online shopping, email checking and pornography viewing are all examples of behaviors that have the potential to cause significant impairment of everyday functioning. Various factors may contribute to PIU including age, gender, socioeconomic status as well as symptoms of mental health conditions or personality traits leading to even more advanced engagement in problematic online behaviors. Furthermore, there is a huge risk that any of these behaviors could have the tendency to increase during and after the COVID-19 quarantine period (3) and may require professional intervention and support. However, it is crucial to have adequate adapted measurements for PIU before developing appropriate tailored interventions.",

However, most of the existing studies in European countries which include Lithuania have focused on problematic online behaviors in children and teenagers (4, 5) . In a cross-sectional study of 1806 13-18 years old schoolchildren in Lithuania, 9.1% of the study subjects showed markedly expressed symptoms of internet addiction as measured with the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire (6) . This particular study also found that symptoms of Internet addiction were also more prevalent among male than female teenagers. Nevertheless, no studies have investigated PIU in young adults and only two reliable questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of Internet addiction in teenagers (4, 5) . Therefore, it is crucial to investigate this particular study group of young adults and identify a questionnaire which could be suitable for a specific assessment. A recent publication by Laconi et al. (7) investigated the psychometric properties of the Nine-Item Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ-9) across various different language-based samples of European internet users, highlighting that a brief scale consisting of only nine questions could reliably screen for PIU. The scale has not been used in Lithuania before and its psychometric properties, validated in other cultural backgrounds, show promising results.",

Originally, both scales were reported to have three subscales: obsession, neglect, and control disorder. Based on the previous study examining the psychometric properties of the PIUQ-9, the short scale has a bi-factor structure including one \"general problem\" factor and two-specific factors of \"obsession\" and \"neglect + control disorder.\" The severity of PIU is assessed through a five point Likert scale, ranging from \"never\" to \"always/almost always.\" The sum score of the questionnaire ranges from nine to 45. A Higher score indicates a higher risk of PIU. The internal consistency of the PIUQ-9 was 0.89 in this particular study sample. As in previous studies (7), all survey questions were translated from English to Lithuanian using the procedure of double back-translation. An experienced psychiatrist (VS) conducted the translation and the back translation was performed by a clinical psychologist (JB). The final consensus was reached by discussing significant differences in the back translation as compared to the original English version.",

Each item ranged from zero (\"not bothered\") to two (\"bothered a lot\") resulting in a total score ranging from zero to 26. The alcohol abuse/dependence module contained five questions with answers \"yes\" and \"no\" asking about the presence of problematic behaviors related to alcohol use occurring more than once in the past 6 months.

In brief, four alternative factor structures were tested: (i) the three-factor model proposed in the study by Koronczai et al. (8) , (ii) a two-factor model where control disorder and neglect factors were merged into one due to the high correlation, (iii) a bi-factor model comprising a dimension of global severity on which each item is loaded, plus three specific factors on which the items belonging to the obsession, neglect and control disorder were loaded and where the correlations between specific factors were fixed at zero; (iii) a bi-factor model representing a global severity dimension plus two specific factors (obsession and neglect + control disorder). The correlations between specific factors were also fixed at zero.

Descriptive results available in our study correspond to the Laconi et al. data (7), for example the mean age of the German sample was 27 \u00b1 10, the mean age of the total sample was 26 \u00b1 9, while the mean age in our sample was 27 \u00b1 9 years. The percentage of men involved in the study dramatically varied between countries in the aforementioned international study (7) ranging from 0.4 to 97% with a mean of 38%. Our study involved a relatively low number of male individuals comprising 17% of the sample. While many of the PIU studies are overrepresented by male subjects (2), our study might better reflect characteristics of Internet use in female students. However, PIUQ-9 scores as well as impairment related to the performance of daily and social activities due to excessive Internet use did not differ between genders. The mean score of 18.4 \u00b1 6.3 of PIUQ-9 in the Lithuanian sample was very close to the mean score of the Polish sample reported in Laconi et al.'s study (7) . Lithuania is culturally closest to Poland, thus it is possible that PIU symptomatology severity corresponds. The percentage of impairment caused by PIU (14%) corresponds to the data on the European PIU prevalence in youth from 11 countries (13) . However, the impairment percent in our study is slightly higher than in the Lithuanian study investigating schoolchildren (6) . Several reasons might explain the discrepancy. First, students are the group with the most expressed Internet consumption. Secondly, problematic use and true clinical impairment due to PIU while overlapping are still two different concepts, which measured with different questionnaires might produce discrepancy. Thus, it is crucial to have a questionnaire which could reliably identify PIU symptomatology in prevalence studies.",

Thus, the results may not represent general or clinical populations and may be subject to selection bias.

During a time with an increased Internet usage due to COVID-19 requirements to self-isolate or study remotely, PIUQ-9 could be a potential tool in measuring PIU severity.
