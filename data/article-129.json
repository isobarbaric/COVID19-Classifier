The nine-item Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ-9) previously validated in multiple countries, could be a potential tool for measuring PIU severity. The main objective of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Lithuanian version of the questionnaire."

The presence of a strong global factor was supported by the common variance index in the bi-factor model indicating that the \"general problem\" factor explained 67.7% of common variance. The multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model showed that psychiatric symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.25) had a moderate, while impairment due to PIU (\u03b2 = 0.41) had a moderate-to-strong direct effect on the factor \"general problem\" supporting the construct validity of the scale."

PIU is increasingly recognized as disproportionately impacting young people and represents an emerging mental health research challenge (2) . Excessive social media use, online streaming, gaming, gambling, online shopping, email checking and pornography viewing are all examples of behaviors that have the potential to cause significant impairment of everyday functioning. Various factors may contribute to PIU including age, gender, socioeconomic status as well as symptoms of mental health conditions or personality traits leading to even more advanced engagement in problematic online behaviors. Furthermore, there is a huge risk that any of these behaviors could have the tendency to increase during and after the COVID-19 quarantine period (3) and may require professional intervention and support. However, it is crucial to have adequate adapted measurements for PIU before developing appropriate tailored interventions."

However, most of the existing studies in European countries which include Lithuania have focused on problematic online behaviors in children and teenagers (4, 5) . In a cross-sectional study of 1806 13-18 years old schoolchildren in Lithuania, 9.1% of the study subjects showed markedly expressed symptoms of internet addiction as measured with the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire (6) . This particular study also found that symptoms of Internet addiction were also more prevalent among male than female teenagers. Nevertheless, no studies have investigated PIU in young adults and only two reliable questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of Internet addiction in teenagers (4, 5) . Therefore, it is crucial to investigate this particular study group of young adults and identify a questionnaire which could be suitable for a specific assessment. A recent publication by Laconi et al. (7) investigated the psychometric properties of the Nine-Item Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ-9) across various different language-based samples of European internet users, highlighting that a brief scale consisting of only nine questions could reliably screen for PIU. The scale has not been used in Lithuania before and its psychometric properties, validated in other cultural backgrounds, show promising results."

Originally, both scales were reported to have three subscales: obsession, neglect, and control disorder. Based on the previous study examining the psychometric properties of the PIUQ-9, the short scale has a bi-factor structure including one \"general problem\" factor and two-specific factors of \"obsession\" and \"neglect + control disorder.\" The severity of PIU is assessed through a five point Likert scale, ranging from \"never\" to \"always/almost always.\" The sum score of the questionnaire ranges from nine to 45. A Higher score indicates a higher risk of PIU. The internal consistency of the PIUQ-9 was 0.89 in this particular study sample. As in previous studies (7), all survey questions were translated from English to Lithuanian using the procedure of double back-translation. An experienced psychiatrist (VS) conducted the translation and the back translation was performed by a clinical psychologist (JB). The final consensus was reached by discussing significant differences in the back translation as compared to the original English version."

The somatoform module consisted of 13 items regarding physical problems that bothered individuals over a 4 weeks period. Each item ranged from zero (\"not bothered\") to two (\"bothered a lot\") resulting in a total score ranging from zero to 26. The alcohol abuse/dependence module contained five questions with answers \"yes\" and \"no\" asking about the presence of problematic behaviors related to alcohol use occurring more than once in the past 6 months. The total score for the module ranged from zero to five. For the statistical modeling, a general score for the questionnaire summing up the four aforementioned modules was used in order to evaluate the global severity of any psychiatric symptomatology.

            "text": "The main objective of the present study was to explore the psychometric characteristics of the PIUQ-9. Descriptive results available in our study correspond to the Laconi et al. data (7), for example the mean age of the German sample was 27 \u00b1 10, the mean age of the total sample was 26 \u00b1 9, while the mean age in our sample was 27 \u00b1 9 years. The percentage of men involved in the study dramatically varied between countries in the aforementioned international study (7) ranging from 0.4 to 97% with a mean of 38%. Our study involved a relatively low number of male individuals comprising 17% of the sample. While many of the PIU studies are overrepresented by male subjects (2), our study might better reflect characteristics of Internet use in female students. However, PIUQ-9 scores as well as impairment related to the performance of daily and social activities due to excessive Internet use did not differ between genders. The mean score of 18.4 \u00b1 6.3 of PIUQ-9 in the Lithuanian sample was very close to the mean score of the Polish sample reported in Laconi et al.'s study (7) . Lithuania is culturally closest to Poland, thus it is possible that PIU symptomatology severity corresponds. The percentage of impairment caused by PIU (14%) corresponds to the data on the European PIU prevalence in youth from 11 countries (13) . However, the impairment percent in our study is slightly higher than in the Lithuanian study investigating schoolchildren (6) . Several reasons might explain the discrepancy. First, students are the group with the most expressed Internet consumption. Secondly, problematic use and true clinical impairment due to PIU while overlapping are still two different concepts, which measured with different questionnaires might produce discrepancy. Thus, it is crucial to have a questionnaire which could reliably identify PIU symptomatology in prevalence studies."

Impairment related to the performance of daily and social activities due to excessive Internet use was a moderate-tostrong predictor of PIU."

            "text": "The major limitation of the present study is the crosssectional design, thereby precluding us from making causal assumptions. The Lithuanian sample consisted of students attending one university and was a comparatively small sample size. Furthermore, the gender distribution of the sample was skewed, with a considerably higher proportion of female students. Thus, the results may not represent general or clinical populations and may be subject to selection bias. Questions on educational level (14) , and socioeconomic status were not included into our survey, limiting a broader scope of the PIU context in students. While we changed the time spent online covariate with the perceived impairment one, we consider that not including this criterion is a significant limitation of this study. Differentiating time spent online on weekend might have further contributed to the general factor of the questionnaire (7)."

The Lithuanian version of the PIUQ-9 has demonstrated appropriate psychometric characteristics and is suitable for screening PIU in university students. Self-reported perceived impairment related to Internet usage is a strong predictor of general PIU psychopathology. Our current study adds PIUQ-9 as a validated tool for clinicians and educators to screen for the risk and severity of PIU. During a time with an increased Internet usage due to COVID-19 requirements to self-isolate or study remotely, PIUQ-9 could be a potential tool in measuring PIU severity. Future longitudinal studies should observe PIU changes over time and establish a cut-off threshold to define individuals who are at possible risk of PIU and therefore should be advised to seek treatment."
