Administration of metformin resulted in a significant reduction in the serum levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase and the activity of malondialdehyde, creatine kinase-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase but maintained high catalase and superoxide dismutase activity. Metformin significantly inhibited the IR-induced elevation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in liver and heart tissue."

            "text": "The process of HIR injury is complex and includes three phases: the ischemia stage, early reperfusion stage, and late reperfusion stage. The primary damage is caused by rapid ATP consumption induced by anaerobic digestion in the liver, increasing intracellular Ca 2 + level and causing mitochondrial dysfunction during the ischemia stage (Wei-Nan Li, 2015) . The acute injury phase, also known as the early reperfusion stage, is characterized by liver injury within 1-6 h of reperfusion and is associated with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Kupffer cell activation, and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (Crockett et al., 2006) . Further progression results in parenchymal dysfunction, direct cellular damage (necrosis, membrane disruptions), and indirect damage through an inflammatory response. Finally, neutrophil infiltration is characterized in the late reperfusion stage and results in ROS production and liver injury (Zabala et al., 2019) . The ROS generated during reperfusion flow from the hepatic vein to the right atrium. Therefore, the heart is the first organ receiving the blood flow after HIR and is susceptible to damage. Myocardial injury can be induced by HIR (Nastos et al., 2014) . Patients with type 2 diabetes, especially obese diabetes, should be treated first with metformin. At present, there are many studies on metformin in various fields, including HIR. Monika et al. indicated that metformin reduced ROS production in complex I, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and reduced postischemia inflammation in fatty liver (Cahova et al., 2015) . Li et al. discovered that the signal pathway TLR4/NF-\u03baB associated with metformin attenuates IR injury of fatty liver . Metformin can achieve anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by activating AMPK and different signals downstream, reducing the release of inflammatory factors and ROS production (Dehkordi et al., 2018) . Therefore, metformin plays a protective role in HIR injury, mainly through antioxidation. It has been reported that metformin could regulate TIGAR inhibit glycolysis then regulate Th17/Treg balance, inhibit the release of liver inflammatory factors, and finally play a role in inhibiting the occurrence of liver injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion (Jiang et al., 2021) Metformin can also induce cardiac protection and improve cardiac function (R. J. Legtenberg 2002) in rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and myocardial infarction by activating AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway (Solskov et al., 2008) and AMPK-eNOS signaling pathway (Jo et al., 2020) , respectively. Moreover, metformin not only induces protective effect in rats, but also has corresponding cardiac protective effect in humans (El Messaoudi et al., 2015) The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of metformin on HIR and myocardial injury during the early reperfusion stage by establishing a 15 min hepatic ischemia model."

In addition, necrosis, hyperemia, hemorrhage, and edema of myocardial cells were observed by histopathological examination. This finding suggests that HIR rarely occurs in isolation. The experimental results indicated that metformin treatment can significantly inhibit the deterioration of liver function and related myocardial injury. In addition, metformin therapy reduces the structural damage in the liver and heart caused by IR damage. It can be observed from the data that the effect of metformin-high 150 mg/kg is slightly better than metformin-low 100 mg/kg. Oxidative stress induced by ROS production is a key factor in HIR injury and plays an important role in the progression of this disease. During the ischemia period, the liver produces substantial ROS that cannot be eliminated. The ROS cause lipid peroxidation and damage of the bio-membrane, resulting in an increased level of MDA, the product of lipid peroxidation, leading to apoptosis and liver injury. (Yang et al., 2021) , (Perluigi et al., 2012) Under normal physiological conditions, the body constantly produces ROS, which is cleared by antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, etc.) to maintain a dynamic physiological balance. However, ischemia affects ROS homeostasis. Our data show that metformin can upregulate the activity of CAT and SOD, enhance the ability to scavenge excess ROS, and reduce the hepatocyte damage caused by ROS. There is evidence that the antioxidant mechanism of metformin can be divided into two processes: 1) direct capture of hydroxy radicals and 2) activation of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT to decompose H 2 O 2 (Dehkordi et al., 2018) Our results are consistent with articles published previously (Zeng et al., 2019) During brain ischemia, the increase and decrease of AMP and ATP levels can activate AMPK. AMPK can stabilize Nrf-2 and induce its gene expression. Induction of the Nrf-2 pathway is related to an increase of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT and SOD (Ashabi et al., 2015) . In this regard, we also believe that metformin can stimulate the activation of AMPK and play an antioxidant role in HIR, which needs to be further confirmed."

            "text": "The inflammatory response plays a critical role in tissue injury induced by HIR. Kupffer cells and endothelial cells are pre-stimulated during hepatic ischemia. In the early stage of reperfusion, Kupffer cells are activated by the complement release of many pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, TLR4, IL-1, Ccr2, etc.) (Cahova et al., 2015) , (Li et al., 2019) , (Zhang et al., 2017) and ROS, leading to liver parenchyma injury and recruiting neutrophils, macrophages, and other inflammatory cells to amplify the inflammatory response. This proinflammatory activation of liver immune cells is regarded as direct cell injury secondary to ischemic injury (Cahova et al., 2015) . TNF-\u03b1, as an important mediator of the inflammatory response in HIR injury, not only induces apoptosis of ischemic hepatocytes (Yang et al., 2021) , but also causes distal organ damage (Zhang et al., 2017) . Apoptosis induced by TNF is due to the combination of TNF and TNFR1 and the formation of an apoptotic signal complex. HO-1 can inhibit the apoptotic signal received by TNF/TNFR1 (Li et al., 2019) . TNF-\u03b1 secretion after IR is regulated by Nox2 and P47phox, which inhibit the production of Nox1-dependent TNF-\u03b1 by Kupffer cells and Nox2 in the liver (Spencer et al., 2013) . Some studies have shown that down-regulating the phosphorylation of AMPK (Ding et al., 2020) , the NF-\u0138B pathway, and inflammatory molecules can reduce the inflammatory response induced by HIR (Zhang et al., 2017) . In addition, previous articles have confirmed that metformin can reduce IR injury of the fatty liver by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u0138B pathway and the level of IR injury by inhibiting the AMPK pathway (Dehkordi et al., 2018) . In conclusion, we speculate that metformin can achieve anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by inhibiting the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway."

            "text": "There are some limitations to this study. First, since the number of samples is small, there might be some discrepancies. Secondly, the ischemia time is less than 15 min, which can damage the liver and heart, but the degree of damage is lighter than that after 30 min or 1 h. The reperfusion time is only 6 h, which is in the early stage of IR. Injury is only caused by ROS produced by Kupffer cells. After 6 h, a complex process of ROS production after neutrophil recruitment is involved. Finally, this study lacks echocardiographic measurement and hemodynamic measurement to judge cardiac function, but we compared and summarized the previously reported articles. Palle, S et al. reported that rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury treated with metformin at all doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg, i. v.) showed improved SV, lvesp, + dP/dt, % LVEF and RPP. (Palee et al., 2020) Moheimani, H.R el. al also confirmed that metformin could eliminate the attenuation of% LVDP and RPP caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. (Moheimani et al., 2021) John, w et al. showed that metformin significantly increased the ejection fraction after treatment in mice with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. (Calvert et al., 2008) Woori, Jo et al. obtained the conclusion that metformin can improve the left ventricular diastolic function in rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion by analyzing echocardiography. (Jo et al., 2020) Although many studies have focused on the effect of metformin on HIR injury, the distal organ damage caused by HIR, such as damage to the heart, is often ignored. Our study is mainly aimed at addressing this problem. The results show that metformin not only alleviates liver injury caused by HIR, but also alleviates myocardial injury. The mechanism needs to be further studied."
