            "text": "Nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABPs), including DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), play vital roles in gene expression. Accurate identification of these proteins is crucial. However, there are two existing challenges: one is the problem of ignoring DNA-and RNA-binding proteins (DRBPs), and the other is a cross-predicting problem referring to DBP predictors predicting DBPs as RBPs, and vice versa. In this study, we proposed a computational predictor, called DeepMC-iNABP, with the goal of solving these difficulties by utilizing a multiclass classification strategy and deep learning approaches. DBPs, RBPs, DRBPs and non-NABPs as separate classes of data were used for training the DeepMC-iNABP model. The results on test data collected in this study and two independent test datasets showed that DeepMC-iNABP has a strong advantage in identifying the DRBPs and has the ability to alleviate the cross-prediction problem to a certain extent. The web-server of DeepMC-iNABP is freely available at http://www.deepmc-inabp.net/. The datasets used in this research can also be downloaded from the website.",

Cross-prediction refers to the DBP predictor identifying true RBPs as DBPs, whereas the RBP predictor predicts true DBPs as RBPs. Moreover, they usually ignore the existence of DRBPs. That is because in these independent binary-class classification models, only DBPs or RBPs are used to build predictors of DNA binding or RNA binding, respectively. Thus, the predictors identified either ''DBPs and non-DNA binding proteins (non-DBPs)\", or ''RBPs and non-RNA binding proteins (non-RBPs)\".",

Four categories, ''DBP\", ''RBP\", ''DRBP\" and ''non-nucleic acid binding protein (non-NABP)\", were defined and used for learning the multiclass classification model. By applying the multiclass classification model based on a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network, the DeepMC-iNABP predictor predicts a protein as each of these classes. The DeepMC-iNABP predictor overcomes the problem of cross-predicting because both DBPs and RBPs are used for training the multiclass learning model. DeepMC-iNABP can not only identify nuclei acid-binding protein but also detect DBPs and RBPs, which will help with the functional annotation of proteins. Moreover, because DRBPs as separate class data are used for training, DRBPs can be identified by the DeepMC-iNABP predictor.",

DBP chains were collected by searching reviewed data with the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation keywords ''DNA binding\" and ''NOT RNA binding\", whereas RBP chains were collected by searching reviewed data with the GO annotation keywords ''RNA binding\" and ''NOT DNA binding\". DRBP chains were obtained by searching reviewed data with the GO annotation keywords ''DNA binding\" and ''RNA binding\". Non-NABP chains were collected by searching the reviewed data with the keyword ''NOT nucleic acid binding\". Then, we deleted duplicate chains and filtered the chains with lengths of less than 40 or more than 1,000. The redundancy between each dataset was reduced by the BLASTP program [31] with the bit-score set as greater than 50.0. After data preprocessing, 12,471 DBP chains, 12,068 RBP chains,1,218 DRBP chains and 143,650 non-NABP chains were remained. Then, we randomly selected sequences data to form the final datasets containing 12,000 DBP chains, 12,000 RBP chains,1,200 DRBP chains and 12,000 non-NABP chains. We first split the final dataset into two (training and testing) at a ratio of 10:1.

First, one-hot encoding and deep representation learning with neural networks were utilized to convert the protein sequence into a fixed-dimension matrix of vector embeddings. CNNs have the advantage of selecting good feature, and LSTMs have a good ability to learn sequential data, which is of great importance in protein structure and function prediction [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] .

In DeepMC-iNABP, there are three convolutional layers, and the number of filters in each convolutional layer was set to 128, 64, 32; the number of kernels was set to 10, 5, 3, respectively. Max pooling is added to CNNs following individual convolutional layers. A dropout layer was designed after each convolutional part which helps to prevent overfitting, as thedropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time. The dropout rate was set to 0.2. The output dimension of the LSTM layer was set to 70. All layers used rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function except the output layer. The activation function of the output layer used softmax function. For the optimizer, we chose Adam, and the learning rate was set to 0.001.
