            "text": "Nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABPs), including DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), play vital roles in gene expression. Accurate identification of these proteins is crucial. However, there are two existing challenges: one is the problem of ignoring DNA-and RNA-binding proteins (DRBPs), and the other is a cross-predicting problem referring to DBP predictors predicting DBPs as RBPs, and vice versa. In this study, we proposed a computational predictor, called DeepMC-iNABP, with the goal of solving these difficulties by utilizing a multiclass classification strategy and deep learning approaches. DBPs, RBPs, DRBPs and non-NABPs as separate classes of data were used for training the DeepMC-iNABP model. The results on test data collected in this study and two independent test datasets showed that DeepMC-iNABP has a strong advantage in identifying the DRBPs and has the ability to alleviate the cross-prediction problem to a certain extent. The web-server of DeepMC-iNABP is freely available at http://www.deepmc-inabp.net/. The datasets used in this research can also be downloaded from the website."

Four categories, ''DBP\", ''RBP\", ''DRBP\" and ''non-nucleic acid binding protein (non-NABP)\", were defined and used for learning the multiclass classification model. By applying the multiclass classification model based on a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network, the DeepMC-iNABP predictor predicts a protein as each of these classes. The DeepMC-iNABP predictor overcomes the problem of cross-predicting because both DBPs and RBPs are used for training the multiclass learning model. DeepMC-iNABP can not only identify nuclei acid-binding protein but also detect DBPs and RBPs, which will help with the functional annotation of proteins. Moreover, because DRBPs as separate class data are used for training, DRBPs can be identified by the DeepMC-iNABP predictor."

DBP chains were collected by searching reviewed data with the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation keywords ''DNA binding\" and ''NOT RNA binding\", whereas RBP chains were collected by searching reviewed data with the GO annotation keywords ''RNA binding\" and ''NOT DNA binding\". DRBP chains were obtained by searching reviewed data with the GO annotation keywords ''DNA binding\" and ''RNA binding\". Non-NABP chains were collected by searching the reviewed data with the keyword ''NOT nucleic acid binding\". Then, we deleted duplicate chains and filtered the chains with lengths of less than 40 or more than 1,000. The redundancy between each dataset was reduced by the BLASTP program [31] with the bit-score set as greater than 50.0. After data preprocessing, 12,471 DBP chains, 12,068 RBP chains,1,218 DRBP chains and 143,650 non-NABP chains were remained. Then, we randomly selected sequences data to form the final datasets containing 12,000 DBP chains, 12,000 RBP chains,1,200 DRBP chains and 12,000 non-NABP chains. We first split the final dataset into two (training and testing) at a ratio of 10:1. After this, we kept aside the test set and randomly chose 90% of our training data to be the actual training set and the remaining 10% to be the validation set. The statistical information of the training data, validation data and test data we collected is listed in Table 1 ."

Although a few studies [33, 34] have focused on the cross-prediction problem for the identification of nucleic acid-binding protein, they obtained low recognition precision, possibly due to the limitations of datasets or sequence feature representations, such as small training datasets and manual selection of sequence features. Here, we treat the identification of NABPs as a multiclass learning task. Multiclass classification refers to the prediction of more than two classes; in fact, there are four protein categories containing DBPs, RBPs, DRBPs and non-NABPs. In multiclass classification, we first design the classifier model, then train the model using training data and validation data, and finally predict the collected test data or independent test data into multiple class labels."

First, one-hot encoding and deep representation learning with neural networks were utilized to convert the protein sequence into a fixed-dimension matrix of vector embeddings. CNNs have the advantage of selecting good feature, and LSTMs have a good ability to learn sequential data, which is of great importance in protein structure and function prediction [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In this study, CNN and LSTM were combined for protein sequence feature learning [44, 45] . Moreover, a one-vs.-all multiclass fully connected network was employed to address the cross-prediction problem, in which each of the output nodes represents a different class. More specifically, the network of the DeepMC-iNABP model contains 15 layers, including an input layer, an embedding layer, 3 convolution layers, 3 pooling layers, 4 dropout layers, a long short -term layer, a dense layer, and an output layer."

Furthermore, 109 sequences of the DBP class were identified as RBPs, while 31 sequences of the RBP class were identified as DBPs. However, few non-NABPs, DBPs and RBPs were identified as DRBPs. Moreover, the evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy, were calculated, as shown in Table 3 , to assess the performance of the DeepMC-iNABP predictor on the test data we collected. These results indicate that the evaluation values of DBP, RBP, DRBP and non-NABP are good, especially the classification of DRBP.

The DeepDRBP-2L predictor utilizes a two-level framework, in which the first level detects NABP or not and the second level further identifies the predicted NABP as DBP, RBP or DRBP [34] . In short, the DeepDRBP-2L predictor consists of a binary classifier (the first level) and a multiclass classifier (the second level). Because of the two-level strategy, it can finally achieve the classification of non-NABP, DBP, RBP and DRBP. Thus, we compared with these two existing nucleic acid-binding protein predictors.
