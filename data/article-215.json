[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] As a result, patients with chronic pain interact with the healthcare system frequently; 20% of primary care visits are related to pain. 10 Evidence-based behavioural treatments for chronic pain are largely inaccessible to most Americans, particularly those in rural communities, due to limited availability of services coupled with recent COVID-19 restrictions on therapist-delivered treatments. 11 There is a need to remotely deploy self-administered, evidence-based treatments that leverage cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), long",

[13] [14] [15] [16] Moreover, these selfcontained programs can overcome geographical, staffing and timing barriers of traditional video and in-person visits. Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising evidence-based treatment modality for reducing both acute and chronic pain. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The ubiquity of highperformance computing has reduced both the size and cost of VR devices such that portable VR units are feasible for everyday in-home use. Most VR research has assessed pain only immediately after a VR experience. 18 21-24 Further, most studies focus on mere distraction to impact the experience of pain ('distraction-based VR'); a small minority of studies assess more complex VR modalities that teach extensible skills using CBT principles, guided meditation and biofeedback-based breathing exercises ('skills-based VR').",

Tertiary objectives include studying the impact of VR on patient reported outcomes (PRO) of depression and physical function, as well as biometric variables measured with a wearable sensor. In addition to assessing PRO and biometric data, the study also aims to identify patient-level predictors for VR efficacy. Here we present the protocol as a model for conducting research on using VR to manage chronic pain.",

Randomisation of all 360 subjects will be performed via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (Nashville, Tennessee), 1:1:1 across the three study groups, with random block sizes ranging from 3 to 12 subjects, stratified by site, using tables generated from Stata V.16.1 (College Station, Texas). Block randomisation is implemented in order to ensure that patients are equally assigned to each treatment group and varying the block size reduces selection bias by preventing predictability of the allocation of patients. The randomisation table was created by an independent biostatistician at CSHS. Each arm will include one-third of the total population randomised. Potential participants will be referred by physicians at the designated clinical sites or identified using the Deep 6 AI cohort building software (Pasadena, California), which uses natural language processing to search electronic health record (EHR) data for patients meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria throughout the healthcare system.

For these models, we will estimate least squares means, SEs, treatment differences (in least squares means) and 95% CIs for each time period. Primary inference will rely on treatment comparison of least squares means for day 30, and a p value will be presented for this time period only. The null hypothesis there is no mean difference in the primary endpoint between the treatment groups and the sham control group. Similar analyses will be conducted for all secondary endpoints.",
