[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] As a result, patients with chronic pain interact with the healthcare system frequently; 20% of primary care visits are related to pain. 10 Evidence-based behavioural treatments for chronic pain are largely inaccessible to most Americans, particularly those in rural communities, due to limited availability of services coupled with recent COVID-19 restrictions on therapist-delivered treatments. 11 There is a need to remotely deploy self-administered, evidence-based treatments that leverage cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), long"

Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising evidence-based treatment modality for reducing both acute and chronic pain. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The ubiquity of highperformance computing has reduced both the size and cost of VR devices such that portable VR units are feasible for everyday in-home use. Most VR research has assessed pain only immediately after a VR experience. 18 21-24 Further, most studies focus on mere distraction to impact the experience of pain ('distraction-based VR'); a small minority of studies assess more complex VR modalities that teach extensible skills using CBT principles, guided meditation and biofeedback-based breathing exercises ('skills-based VR')."

Tertiary objectives include studying the impact of VR on patient reported outcomes (PRO) of depression and physical function, as well as biometric variables measured with a wearable sensor. In addition to assessing PRO and biometric data, the study also aims to identify patient-level predictors for VR efficacy.

Two different VR pain reduction programmes will be compared with a control placebo VR program among patients with cLBP. Randomisation of all 360 subjects will be performed via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (Nashville, Tennessee), 1:1:1 across the three study groups, with random block sizes ranging from 3 to 12 subjects, stratified by site, using tables generated from Stata V.16.1 (College Station, Texas). Block randomisation is implemented in order to ensure that patients are equally assigned to each treatment group and varying the block size reduces selection bias by preventing predictability of the allocation of patients. The randomisation table was created by an independent biostatistician at CSHS. Each arm will include one-third of the total population randomised. Potential participants will be referred by physicians at the designated clinical sites or identified using the Deep 6 AI cohort building software (Pasadena, California), which uses natural language processing to search electronic health record (EHR) data for patients meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria throughout the healthcare system. The sites of randomisation will include patient search engine recruitment (Deep 6), orthopaedic recruitment sites, rheumatology recruitment sites and pain clinic recruitment sites."

All three interventions will include 56 modules with a defined sequence of daily sessions. Once they complete the schedule of content sequentially, participants can repeat the experiences as many times as desired.

EaseVRx combines psychoeducation, pain education, breathing training, relaxation exercises and executive functioning games to provide a mind-body approach toward living better with chronic pain (see figure 2 for details). The standardised, prescriptive and reproducible 56-day programme delivers a combination of skills training and CBT-related treatments through scheduled daily virtual experiences. An earlier version of this programme was used in a recently published randomised trial comparing it to an audio control of the same programme. 28 Each VR experience lasts from 2 to 16 min, with an average duration of 6 min."
