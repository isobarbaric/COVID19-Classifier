We also examine how these health behaviours differ by the presence of chronic conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol level, heart disease, diabetes or chronic bronchitis, which can be considered as risk factors for COVID-19. Our results suggest that while on average, people became less precautious during the analysed time period, this is less so for those who are at higher risk. We also document large regional differences in precautionary health behaviours and show that higher-risk individuals are on average more cautious in all regions. We conclude that people adjusted their health behaviours in line with the generally understood risk of the COVID-19 disease. At the same time, our results also point out divergences in the level of willingness to take different precautionary steps.",

Accordingly, some of our everyday activities have changed drastically since the outbreak of the pandemic as governments urged citizens to take precautionary steps, stemming from recommending hand sanitising and mandating wearing a mask in public to staying at home, often forced by a curfew. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we investigate the time patterns of several precautionary health behaviours among the European population above age 50 years during the summer (June and July) of 2020. We can consider this period as an easing phase of the COVID-19 pandemic since it falls between the \"first wave\" (spring of 2020) and the \"second wave\" (autumn of 2020). Although there were heterogeneities across countries, average death rates due to COVID-19 slightly decreased (WHO 2020) and COVID-19-related policies became on average less stringent (Hale et al. 2021 ) over this period.",

Do we see that cautious behaviour of older people is spreading or is it rather fading over time?

Given the substantially larger COVID-19 mortality risk of older people (it was 3.7 times higher in the age group above 60/65 years than in the general population; also, 90 per cent or more of reported COVID-19 deaths occurred in this age group during the first wave of the pandemic in European countries, see OECD and European Union 2020, p. 55.), especially of those suffering from chronic diseases, it is important to understand the dynamics of different health behaviours to curb the number of fatalities due to the virus.",

            "text": "Drivers of health behaviour are complex; ecological models provide a comprehensive framework of the multiple and interacting levels of factors that influence health behaviour, grouped into intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational, community and public policy levels (Sallis et al. 2008; Richard et al. 2011) . Given the substantial negative externalities arising from irresponsible individual behaviour during a pandemic, governments introduced restrictions of individual behaviour in most European countries with varying levels of policy stringency (Hale et al. 2021) . Apart from policy stringency, the likelihood of compliant behaviour also varies both across and within countries. Accordingly, some of the recent scholarly attention has focused on understanding the factors behind adhering to cautious health behaviour under COVID-19. The assessed factors are diverse, and the results are mixed, and some found that in the USA partisanship is the single most consistent factor that differentiates health behaviours (Gadarian et al. 2020) , and others (Harper et al. 2020 ) found no effect of politically relevant variables and named simply the fear of COVID-19 as the predictor of positive behaviour change, i.e. of improved hand hygiene and physical distancing (or, using the terminology of Harper et al. social distancing) . Wise et al. (2020) also reported that the strongest predictor of physical distancing was the perceived likelihood of personally being infected. A Japanese study highlights the importance of awareness and knowledge as being informed about COVID-19 was associated with a more precautious behaviour (Shiina et al. 2020) . Based on a sample of students in Switzerland, Franzen and W\u00f6hner (2021) found that personal interests in staying at home (i.e. having high-risk relatives) increased compliance. Clark et al. (2020) observed that belief in the effectiveness of health precautions against COVID-19 and prioritising one's health in general made a difference. Similarly, Bourassa et al. (2020) demonstrated that physical distancing is associated with conventional health behaviours and healthier habits in general.",

            "text": "The rapidly expanding COVID literature has yet collected less evidence specifically about the behaviour of older people, though Clark et al. (2020) found that age was generally unrelated to voluntary compliant behaviours during the pandemic. In general, the public discourse during the pandemic characterised older people as a rather homogeneous vulnerable group that society needs to protect even at the cost of sacrificing much of their social life and that of other generations as well . Although the ageing process and older people are diverse, their health status, attitudes and behaviour vary (Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani et al. 2011) . For instance, not only actual age but positive views on ageing in general and a younger subjective age (or a more youthful identity) are often associated with health-promoting activities, such as walking Montepare, 2020) . Similarly, self-efficacy, in other words perceived competency, has a beneficial effect on health behaviour, and it may explain part of the relationship between socio-economic status and health status (Grembowski et al. 1993) . Apart from diverging attitudes, the health status of older people varies as well. For example, there are profound disparities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in the European Union by socio-economic status (OECD and European Union 2020). Thus, it is worth studying the heterogeneities of the older age group to better understand their behaviour.",

            "text": "Our simple theoretical framework of individual-level drivers of health behaviour covers the perceived probability of getting infected and the perceived health risk of an infection, which together influence the general level of risk aversion related to COVID-19. Then, deciding about each precautionary step involves a subjective cost-benefit analysis of the behaviour shift. Note that some precautionary behaviours, such as wearing a mask, can have positive externalities by reducing the risk of infecting others (Salani\u00e9 and Treich 2020) . Here, we assume that people take into account only the subjective cost and benefit of each precautionary step, which might include an altruistic motive. We suspect that the perceived health risk is influenced by objective (or wellestablished) risk factors, such as age, chronic diseases and being a male that are all positively related to the health risk imposed by COVID-19 (Ssentongo et al. 2020; O'Driscoll et al. 2021) , and by the knowledge and awareness of these risk factors, which are usually associated with educational level. Regarding the individual-level cost-benefit analysis of changing a behaviour, we have several considerations. First, some precautionary steps are in general less costly than others (i.e. hand washing vs. not meeting family) and thus we expect them to be more widespread. Second, the same precautionary step may impose different levels of costs to different people. For example, we expect that those who are employed and those who live alone are less likely to stay at home and to give up personal social interactions as that would mean a larger sacrifice from them.",

Given the large sample size and variation in interview times, we are also able to demonstrate time trends of average levels of precaution, and we show regional differences in precautionary behaviour across Europe, indicative of the role of the cultural and policy context. Our paper is structured as follows. First, we briefly introduce the data and the health behaviour, health status and control variables we use. Then, we show the time patterns of different health behaviours over the summer, both together and separately for individuals with and without a chronic condition. We also demonstrate regional differences of health behaviour, while keeping the decomposition by chronic condition. Finally, we turn to our linear probability models of different health behaviour changes, where next to the baseline associations some of the regressions allow differing time trends of behaviour by health status and age.

We fit linear probability models of the eight health behaviour indicators using a linear time trend, the presence of the five specific chronic conditions, gender, age, education level, employment status at the time of the outbreak, the binary variable of living alone and country indicators (fixed effects) as explanatory variables.

Also, if leaving their home, 76% always kept distance and 59% always wore a face mask in public. Fifty-three per cent of respondents stayed at home or did not visit other family members and 63% did not meet more than five people outside the household since the outbreak. (These two indicators will be referred to as \"no meeting\" indicators below.) Even the most substantial changes in health behaviour-never leaving home for walking and for shopping since the outbreak-were reported by 31% and 27%, respectively. A gradual loosening of the behavioural changes during the eight examined weeks is especially visible for the two \"no meeting\" and the \"distance in public\" indicators. Meanwhile, the proportion of those who always wear a mask in public or use sanitiser more often seem to increase. Figure 2 shows these descriptive time trends split by the health status of the respondents. People with chronic conditions were in general more cautious. The differences by health status are the strongest for the no walks, no shopping and the two \"no meeting\" indicators, while negligible for hand washing and hand sanitising. The graphs also indicate that regarding the two \"no meeting\" measures, people with chronic conditions-compared to healthy respondents-rather kept their cautiousness during the summer. For the other measures, we do not see clear evidence for diverging time patterns by health status. Figure 3 displays the average values of the health behaviour indicators by country groups and health status. Within each country group and for each indicator, we again see that people with chronic conditions were more careful. The differences by health status are the strongest for the no walks, no shopping and the two \"no meeting\" indicators, while they are negligible for hand washing and hand sanitising. We also see that on average, people in Western and Northern Europe were the least cautious during the analysed period, especially about going for walks, shopping, meeting with family members and wearing masks. We do not see major differences in precautionary health behaviours between Southern and Eastern Europe, although some of them are slightly more prevalent in the South than in the East. ",

Table 2 displays the effect of specific chronic conditions and the time trend after controlling for individual characteristics and country indicators. Diagnosed hypertension and high blood cholesterol increase the prevalence of precautionary health behaviour measures generally by 1-2%points, while the more severe conditions (heart disease, diabetes and chronic bronchitis) increase the first four (main) indicators by 2-9%points but do not generally have a substantial effect on the other four measures.

We do not see such differences by age for the \"distance\", \"mask\" and \"hand washing\" indicators, while the prevalence of hand sanitising even decreases with age. Females, although face smaller objective risk, are more risk averse, and their indicators are 2-7%points higher than those of males. The effect of the level of education is ambiguous as it decreases the main indicators and increases the others.

The two \"no meeting\" and the \"distance to others\" indicators show significant heterogeneities in their trends: they decreased by 8-10%points in the eight weeks for the healthy and only by 4-5% points for the chronically ill population.

The number of COVID-19-related death cases per million population decreased from 0.31 in the first week of our observation period to 0.14 in the fifth week and only went up to 0.19 by the last week (July 27-August 2) (WHO, 2020 statistics, weighted by our sample). At the same time, governments gradually eased the COVID-19-related policy restrictions during this time period, as shown by the stringency indicator of the University of Oxford (Hale et al. 2021) . Our results suggest that the time patterns of precautionary health behaviours differ by the costliness of the behaviours. We do not see Table 3 Linear probability models of health behaviours with bi-weekly interview time effects Robust standard errors in brackets, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. All regressions include the individual-level control variables and country dummies of major changes in the least adapted, most costly behaviours (not going out for walks or shopping). We see decreasing patterns in the costly but more widely adapted behaviours (not meeting with family members, with others and keeping distance in public places). Note that the decreasing patterns might be the joint consequence of the easing of restrictive policy measures, of the decrease of COVID-19-related death cases and also of changing risk attitudes and risk perceptions of individuals. It is beyond the scope of this study to disentangle these various mechanisms. Finally, the least costly behaviours are found to be the most persistent; we even see increasing patterns in wearing mask and hand sanitising. Our analysis also revealed that individuals with a higher health risk due to chronic conditions acted differently and were more likely to take even the costly precautionary steps over the summer across all three European regions. On average, people in Western and Northern Europe were the least cautious during the analysed period. The regional differences cannot be explained by differences in the rate of COVID-19-related death cases or policy stringency as, on average, Western and Northern Europe is characterised by similar cumulative COVID-19-related death rates (as measured by WHO 2020) and stringency indicators (as measured by Hale et al. 2021) as Southern Europe. Also, precautionary behaviours were rather similar in the East and South, despite the lower COVID-19-related death rates and stringency in the East.",

Our findings point to the divergence in the level of willingness to take different precautionary steps since subjective costs of forgoing social interactions are higher than the individual-level costs of increased personal hygiene. We also observe substantial heterogeneities among older people in the level and time trends of their health behaviour as objective risk factors such as a chronic condition or older age affect the level of precaution. From a policy point of view, it is reassuring that more vulnerable people take more efforts to avoid an infection, highlighting the importance of raising awareness about the risk factors related to the pandemic. At the same time, considering the positive externalities of precautionary behaviours, it can be desirable to maintain high levels of precautions even among the less vulnerable groups. Our findings also underline that some of the older people may need more assistance, for example to do the shopping or to fight the mental health implications of loneliness and increased stress during a lockdown.",
