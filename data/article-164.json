Unlike the standard SIR model, SIR-NC does not assume population conservation. Although similar in form to the standard SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to model mortality, and also provides different, and arguably a more realistic, interpretation of the model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC model with the standard, population conserving, SIR model are provided. Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models that include births and deaths are presented and analyzed. Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate these models."

This classical model assumes a community where everyone interacts with everyone in a homogeneous manner and the average behavior of these interactions are known. In contrast, in some new applications, the community interactions are represented by a graph and the interactions happen along the edges of the graph. See for example [10] for models of SIR epidemics on graphs. There are also stochastic models that explictly account for randomness, see, e.g., [2] , [3] . The standard SIR model for a single community is a compartmental model in which the population is divided into sub-populations of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. At time t, let S(t) be the size of the population that is susceptible to be infected by the epidemic, I(t) be the number in the population that is currently infected and carrying the infection, and R(t) be the number that have recovered from the infection and are neither going to infect others nor will be infected again.

More recently, a parametric solution for the general case has been described in [12] .

For example, in the SIR model of (1), it is easy to see that \u03bbS(0) > \u03b3 will lead to a breakout of the epidemic. It is also known that at the end of the epidemic, the number that will not be infected will be strictly greater than 0, i.e., S(t) \u2192 c > 0. Several other key parameters are also of interest, especially if the infections result in the need for hospitalizations and other healthcare resources. The popular phrase in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has been \"flattening the curve\", i.e., to delay and/or reduce the peak I(t). Using the parametric solution of [12] , we can get a closed form expression for the maximum value of I(t) (see (7) in a later section) in the SIR system of (1). However, the time at which this peak is achieved has to be obtained through a numerical solution to an integral equation."

Thus, not surprisingly, application of interventions by suitably modulating either of \u03bb or \u03b3 to achieve specific control objectives is not well studied. 2 In this paper we first make an important and, what we believe to be, a more realistic change to the basic SIR model in which we drop the population conservation assumption of (1) and propose the SIR-NC (for 'Non-Conservative') epidemic model. This is motivated by first recognizing that those that recover neither infect the others nor can they be infected by virtue of having developed immunity. (The SIR model confers immunity on those that have recovered. As of the writing of this paper, 1 While explaining that removing the population conservation constraint would make solutions for the even simpler SIS model impossible, the authors remark \"It would seem that a fatal disease which this models is also not good for mathematics\". 2 We remark here that this kind of control is different from vaccination based control whose effect is to reduce the susceptible population. This has received significant attention in the research literature. reinfections in COVID-19 are rare and the SIR is a very good model. The SIS model and its variants may be used for cases where re-infections are more common.) Thus we can treat R(t) as the part of the population that is 'dropping out' or removed from the system."

The parameter \u03b3 would then be the sum rate of all these. If one wants to focus on, say, the recovered, denoted by R(t), one would then have\u1e58(t) = \u03b2I(t) where \u03b2 < \u03b3 is the recovery rate. Similar formalism will be posited for the dead, the quarantined, etc. Thus our SIR-NC model allows us to model non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) such as early isolation and quarantining of those that are infected through testing. Importantly, this is achieved without the addition of any new compartments to the model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next subsection we introduce the SIR-NC model and present its solution in the following section. In Section 2.1 we develop the model and present Theorem 1 that provides an explicit expression for (I(t), S(t)), the peak value of I(t), and the time at which the peak is realized. The case of time-varying \u03bb and \u03b3 are also included. Theorem 1 is proved in Section 2.2. Several variations of the basic model are discussed in Section 3-analysis of a community with imported infections (Section 3.1), interacting communities (Section 3.2), and the SIR-NC model that allows for natural births and deaths (Section 3. 3) . Numerical examples will be used to illustrate these models. In Section 4 we discuss several control problems over a finite horizon for the SIR-NC model after discussing the control objectives, specifically, minimum cost control problems that control I(t) so as to achieve specific objectives. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 develop the finite horizon continuous time and discrete time control problems. In Section 4.4, we develop a more general multi-objective, multi-community control problem. Illustrative numerical results are also presented."

That would lead to a different dynamics. In other words, suppose that the individual meetings happen on a common Poisson clock with a fixed rate and we choose to observe only those between the susceptible and the infected or the susceptible. Any reasonable continuum limit of this should also re-scale \u03b3 as \u03b3/ N (t) because of the time scaling implicit in the above sampling. Our model is distinct from this scenario in that it requires each person to meet a statistically significant portion of the entire population 'at one go'. This is, for example, what would happen at the workplace, in the school, during the commute, etc. This is also the view in the agent based simulation model implemented in [15] . What this stands for is that the 'atomic' or individual pairwise meetings take place on a faster time scale than the death rate due to the epidemic, which is a reasonable assumption. A simple scenario would be the discrete dynamics S n+1 = S n \u2212 \u01ebS n \u03b6 n ,"

Further, we will use \u03b3(t) = \u03b3 0 (1 + bt) which models a super-exponential increase in testing capacity and isolation. In Fig. 4a , \u03b3(t) is a constant (\u03b3 0 ) and \u03bb(t) has the form above. We plot I(t) for different values of t 1 . We see that an early lockdown (corresponding to t 1 = 15 and 25) only delays the T max but does not change I max . If the lockdown is started close to the peak, it results in 'second wave' with the second peak being lower than the first. A moderate delay in the start of the lockdown (t 1 = 40) arrests the first growth but does not significantly affect I max or T max . If the lockdown starts close to the peak, I(t) comes down sharply but causes a second peak! In Fig. 4b we plot I(t) keeping \u03bb(t) constant, i.e., no lockdowns, and use \u03b3(t) as above. This is to be expected because, the lockdowns only postpone the inevitable. bserve that even a small amount of increased testing and quarantining can be very effective in reducing I max significantly; a 1% increase in the rate of removal per unit time (doubling testing capacity in 70 time units) reduces I max by about 30% whereas a 3% (double capacity in 24 days) can decrease I max by 70%. T max is not affected significantly in this. Finally, in Fig. 4c , we plot I(t) when there is lockdown and also the \u03b3 is increased."

The standard SIR model has been extended to include natural births and deaths. However, almost all the models continue to make the population conservation assumption-the natural death rate is equal to the birth rate and the total population is conserved. The SIR-NC model naturally allows for unconstrained birth and death rates. Thus in this section we describe the SIR-NC model that includes births and natural deaths with no constraints on the rates. However, if we introduce some restrictions on the parameters, not unlike those that are derived from the standard SIR model, we can provide additional insights to the properties of the evolution of the epidemic. Here, we make the natural assumption that all births are susceptible."

In SIR-NC, we have separated the relative time scales of the two processes, but the interpretation remains. While p is more likely to be a feature of the infection and the community, \u00b5 can be controlled through measures such as imposing social distancing and varying degrees of lockdown. Hence we let \u03bb take finitely many discrete levels. Further, as we have argued earlier, the recovered population is viewed as removal. In practice, increasing the removal rate is effected by identifying the infected early, i.e., by increased testing and quarantining of those that test positive.

This explains (30). Inequality (31) is in similar spirit for the discrete control decision of switching: equality holds when it is optimal to switch, inequality holds otherwise.

For the parameters chosen, the switching costs and the running cost of reduced \u03bb was too high for the system to switch \u03bb, thus \u03bb(t) = 1/4 was the control for all the parameters. As we changed a 3 from 1.0 to 1.2, for decreasing \u03b1(t), the change in both I(t) and \u03b3(t) was barely noticeable. This was the case even when \u03b1(t) was held constant at 0.1. However as we changed a 3 from 1.2 to 1.35 the changes were significant both in shape and magnitude of I(t), \u03b3(t), and the total running cost. This can be seen when comparing the plots in Figs. 10 and 11. A higher a 3 induces higher levels of control and hence reduced I(t) this in turn reduced the running cost. Observe that there is an order of magnitude reduction in I(t) and in the cost. Thus a higher 'valuation' for infections induces a higher level control which in turn reduces costs in the long run."

As in [23] , the discrete iteration (which can be viewed as the Euler scheme for (50) with slowly decreasing stepsizes) tracks the asymptotic behavior of (50).

This Non-Conservative SIR or SIR-NC for short, has the advantage of being analytically tractable, leading to explicit expressions in the simple cases, and in addition, being more realistic for lethal pandemics. We also introduced several variations of the basic model, such as inclusion of natural birth and death rates, external inputs, interacting communities, etc. While some preliminary results have been presented for these, they open up many new directions for future work."

After introducing a variety of control objectives and arguing that Model Predictive Control is a natural framework for pandemic control, we propose a finite horizon control problem. First we do so for the original continuous time case, leading to a system of quasi-variational inequalities due to co-occurrence of continuous controls with discrete controls that also have switching costs."
