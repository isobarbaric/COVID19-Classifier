As a result, global cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have increased at an unprecedented rate [2] . The omicron variant can spread easily in individuals even if they have completed their vaccination course. Several mutations in the omicron variant are expected to enable the virus to evade the immune system established by vaccination, resulting in increased infectivity [3, 4] . In addition, a decrease in immunity elicited by vaccines over time, namely waning immunity, may play an important role in the omicron variant's spread [5] . However, vaccines remain effective in protecting against severe diseases caused by the omicron variant, although the effectiveness may have decreased in the omicron variant rather than in previous variants [6] . Understanding the extent of vaccine effectiveness on clinical protection in patients with breakthrough infection caused by the omicron variant is needed to take measures to minimise the damage from the current pandemic."

According to several reports, the omicron variant virus presumably has weakened virulence, which is related to reduced severity, hospitalisation, and mortality [7, 8] . However, the recent explosive increase in the number of omicron variant infections has increased the total number of deaths, and the omicron's spread has not slowed as of 28 February 2022. In this situation, to efficiently use limited medical resources, it is important to predict which patients will go through an unfavourable clinical course and put concentrated efforts into them."

Neutralising antibody responses are highly predictive of protection in vaccinated individuals [14] . However, identifying neutralising antibodies is not feasible for practical use in clinical settings because it is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task. Instead, monitoring antibody levels to spike proteins using commercial kits is more convenient and logistically feasible. Our study provides evidence that antibody level is an important predictor of the clinical course in patients with breakthrough infection by showing a close relationship between low antibody levels and an unfavourable disease course such as fever, hypoxia, pneumonia, CRP elevation, and lymphopenia. Our data fill the gap of missing data on the impact of variable antibody responses to vaccination on the disease course of COVID-19."

We also observed higher antibody levels in vaccine-completed individuals with primary vaccination than in booster-vaccinated individuals (data not shown). However, booster vaccination was not associated with clinical protection in patients with breakthrough infections caused by the delta and omicron variants in this study. We postulate that this finding is attributable to the fact that the indicator of clinical protection used in this study could be sufficiently prevented by the level of antibodies that was mounted by primary vaccination. This study could not evaluate the occurrence of severe outcomes (e.g. mechanical ventilation or mortality) as indicators of clinical protection because of the specific baseline conditions of the included patients.

Second, since our study hospital has specific criteria for admission, which allowed only patients with mild to moderate severity to be admitted, we could not investigate the effects of antibody levels on outcomes such as moving to the severe phase (n=2) or death (n=0). Therefore, further studies involving a larger number of patients with a wide range of disease severity are warranted. Third, the diagnosis of pneumonia in this study was based on chest radiographic findings. Chest radiography is limited in its ability to detect subtle pneumonia.

Relevant variables with a significance level of less than 0.1 through univariate logistic regression analysis or with a clinical significance were included in the multivariable model. The relationship between antibody levels and Ct values was confirmed using a generalised linear model. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.1.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Results A total of 187 patients were admitted to Yongin Severance Hospital between 11 December 2021 and 10 February 2022. Of these, 172 patients underwent tests for SARS-CoV-2 variant type assay. Results of the assay revealed that 79 patients were infected with the delta variant, 82 with the omicron variant, and seven with the undetermined type. There were no cases of reinfection. According to the inclusion criteria for analyses using antibody levels, 106 patients who underwent antibody testing within a defined period were selected from 111 vaccinated patients: 39 with delta variant infections and 67 with omicron variant infections (Figure 1A). Antibody levels were tested at a median of 4 days (IQR 2-6) of symptom onset or diagnosis, and variant-type assays were performed at 4 days (IQR 3-5) after the initial diagnosis (Figure 1B). Of the 161 patients who had the delta or omicron variant infection, 85 (53 %) were women, and the mean age was 54.5 (\u00b118.9) years. Patients with omicron variant infection were younger than those with delta variant infection (p=0.017). The proportion of female patients, distribution of body mass index, frequency of immunocompromised status, or CCI \u22653 were similar among patients with delta and omicron variant infections. Although patients with delta variant infection were more frequently asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (p=0.01), thosewith an omicron variant infection had lower occurrence rates of pneumonia (p<0.001) andAll rights reserved.
