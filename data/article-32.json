            "text": "Strengthening the capacity of midwives and nurses in low-and middle-income countries to lead research is an urgent priority in embedding and sustaining evidence-based practice and better outcomes for women and newborns during childbearing. International and local travel restrictions and physical distancing resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has compromised the delivery of many existing programmes and challenged international partnerships working in maternal and newborn heath to adapt rapidly. In this paper, we share the experiences of a midwife-led research partnership between Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, UK, Zambia and Zimbabwe in sustaining and enhancing capacity strengthening activities remotely in this period. Whilst considerable challenges arose, and not all were overcome, collectively we gained new insights and important learning which have shifted perspectives and will impact future design and delivery of learning programmes.

Despite significant overall research investment, capacity strengthening which 'enhances the abilities of individuals, organisations and systems to undertake and disseminate high quality research efficiently and effectively' [2] has lagged behind other research activities in many LMICs [3] . Commonly, funding and leadership continue to be controlled from institutions based in high income countries (HICs), whose researchers are often characterised as 'parachuting' into LMICs to conduct research [4] . This 'neo-colonial' approach reinforces unequal power relations and hinders development of local infrastructure, support functions and governance structures needed for sustainable research programmes. Inequity is not the only issue, the domination of expertise and intellectual direction from HICs is also likely to negatively impact on research quality and future impact [5] . It is increasingly recognised that effective and appropriate solutions to complex health issues requires meaningful involvement of those living and working in local settings, with a nuanced understanding including barriers and facilitators of change."

Pre-COVID, most activities were delivered face to face based on understanding of the context and participant learning styles, gained during previous capacity development programmes across the partnership. This was facilitated by a variety of contacts; regular country visits were made by the Africa co-ordinator (SW) and UK team, and whole group start-up and annual meetings included training workshops and development reviews. Inperson delivery facilitated high degrees of interactivity which was considered essential for the focus on practical and skills-based content. Master's supervision and some development activities, particularly those targeted at country leads were delivered remotely including blended approaches."

Fortunately, most project-specific training for year three had already been completed at this stage, but potential for increased 'downtime' due to reduced activity was identified, particularly for research assistants J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f employed full-time on the programme. Both UK and country leads were eager to capitalise on the COVID-19 interruption as an opportunity to provide additional training and development sessions. In addition to maintaining momentum in skills development, online contacts were perceived to support relationships and networks amongst the research team, built during the previous 30 months. A brief survey, conducted via email, ascertained interest in remote learning, suggestions and preferences for topics to be covered."

Short sessions were preferred to minimise fatigue and exhaustion frequently reported with remote learning activities [11] . These also accommodated time differences of up to three hours between UK and Africa sites, meaning all were scheduled within normal working hours in UK and Africa.

Despite efforts to foster an interactive approach, some participants still expressed lack of 'connectedness' and facilitators reported negative impacts of lack of visual cues and feedback. Use of the 'chat' function and question and answer sessions addressed this to some extent, use of webcams during sessions was encouraged but was not always possible due to poor internet connections. Some participants attended webinars in groups, where this was permitted, this allowed sharing experiences and small group discussion more effectively. Recent studies have identified the lack of emotional connection between providers and learners, often facilitated by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f subtle non-verbal cues including facial expression and gestures, as a barrier to learning in online environments [15] . Phirangee and Hewitt (2016) observed students increasingly using emoticons, punctuation (particularly exclamation marks) and the 'Like' button, originally developed in social media but incorporated into videoconferencing and communication platforms including Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet to enable reactions during educational activities [16] . These low effort non-verbal supports were perceived to support active expression and engagement and increase feelings of security. Participants in our sessions did not use these extensively, signposting and role modelling by the facilitator could increase awareness and provide an alternative means of communication, which does not interrupt the flow of activities. Careful planning and delivery can, to some extent, mitigate lack of contact during online sessions. However, it is recognised that much benefit from educational activities is also gained from informal and ad hoc contacts with colleagues and facilitators which are difficult to replicate in a virtual environment [17] . Internet quality and availability were also a major issue for some participants, particularly those based in rural areas. The cost of connection using mobile internet was not anticipated as an issue, fortunately funds were available to reimburse research staff for expenses, but accurate costing to support access will be an important consideration for future programmes."

            "text": "Restricted travel has also significantly reduced the NIHR Stillbirth Group carbon footprint, the increased volume of air travel in recent decades is a major contributor to carbon emissions and has numerous other undesirable environmental consequences. Some group members preferred this virtual delivery and increased use of this mode also made the entire programme accessible to more participants across the group and allowed inclusion of external participants. The remote programme J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f also perceptibly increased south to south networking amongst research assistants, stemming from strengthened connections via the WhatsApp group. The transfers of international conferences online, with reduced or free access also increased participation, especially for junior researchers who might lack resources for travel needed to attend in person. Although positive impacts are acknowledged, the wider health and social impacts of the sudden move to home or remote working, including training, are not fully understood. Home working is associated with variable mental and physical health outcomes and there is also emerging evidence that exacerbation of existing social inequities may result, for example where inadequate space, equipment or internet access prevent effective engagement and interaction [18] . Gender roles may also impact on ability and quality of engagement especially where training is accessed from home. Whilst flexibility might present some advantages, women who are home working more often report the lack of physical distance impacts on balancing work with domestic responsibilities, leading to increased stress and exhaustion [19] ."

Materials needed to be carefully adapted to the remote environment, content was continually refined to reinforce elements of interactivity which could be lost during remote delivery. We acknowledge the importance of open discussion around potential issues and innate limitations with remote platforms ideally, including both facilitators and participants. This helped us plan backup strategies and alternative communication modes which were used to minimise technical and access issues more effectively as the programme progressed."
