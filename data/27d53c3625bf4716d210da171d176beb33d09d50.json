Although COVID-19 is a disease with primarily physical implications, the pandemic and the related government-imposed lockdowns have had a profound impact on mental health and psychosocial well-being across the globe. The global populace has been faced with the fear of contracting the virus, the lack of an effective vaccine program, and the potential adverse socio-economic consequences related to unemployment and global decline of economies, and fear of lack of access to essential commodities. These factors have led to a mental health crisis of unprecedented nature, witnessed not only on an individual level but also on the societal level.",

            "text": "A wealth of studies has shown increased burden of mental health problems during the pandemic amongst the general public (please see reviews [1] [2] [3] . Studies have reported greater symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater stress, and lower psychological well-being in general public across the globe, compared to pre-pandemic levels [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Increases in social distress and maladaptive coping styles to manage stress have emerged, with rise in patterns of alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence cases [9, 10] . These negative effects on mental health have been found to be even more pronounced in essential or system-relevant workers, with poor sleep quality and distress being reported additionally [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, children and adolescents have been particularly vulnerable during this period due to exposure to chronic stress, domestic violence and isolation from peers, which has led to increased levels of loneliness in the youth population [14] . This would further enhance the risk of developing mental health disorders in the long-run. Preliminary evidence indicates that women [15] [16] [17] , youth populations [18] , individuals who report poor sleep quality [12, 16] , individuals reporting poor family functioning [15] , and individuals employed full-time [19] may be at an increased risk for mental health problems. Furthermore, a range of psychological risk factors have been found to predict worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic, such as worry [19, 20] , psychological inflexibility [21, 22] , ineffective or maladaptive use of emotion regulation and attention is the variety of sounds occurring in the environment. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be helpful in treatment of several mental disorders [57, 58] . A range of interventions have been developed which have shown efficacy in reducing stress and chronic pain [59] , alleviating depressive symptoms [39] , preventing addiction-related relapses [60] , and improving healthy eating behavior [61] . Further, they have also shown to have a positive impact on psychological resilience [62] , and enhancing factors of social cohesion such as interpersonal functioning [63] . The adaptation of these mindfulness-based interventions to online platforms have also shown significant, small to moderate effects in alleviating depressive and anxious symptoms, stress reduction, and enhancement of mental well-being [44] . Meanwhile, the compassion-based programs, such as MSC and CFT, have been geared towards enhancing socio-affective competencies, such as self-and other-compassion, loving kindness, prosocial motivation, altruism and empathy, in order to further improve personal and social resilience [64] . These compassion-based programs [40, 41, 65, 66 ] are a confluence of mindfulness-based exercises and compassion meditation practices, which often forms an integrative structured multi-component program rooted in explicitly cultivating qualities such as acceptance, care, gratitude and compassion. For example, the MSC program involves exercises aimed at developing compassionate inner voice, dealing with difficult emotions and interpersonal relationships, and living in accordance with core values. Compassion-based programs often involve the combination of more formal meditation practices (such as loving kindness meditation), and informal, interpersonal exercises (such as interpersonal sharing of self-criticizing and loving words).",

This longitudinal study included different types of training modules which allowed for the direct comparison of three different training modules which focused on: 1) attention-based mindfulness practices (Presence), 2) compassion-based socio-emotional practices (Affect), and 3) meta-cognitive socio-cognitive practices (Perspective; for a review, see [68] . The Presence module trained attention-based mindfulness, the Affect module focused on socio-emotional skills such as compassion, gratitude, care and coping with difficult emotions through acceptance, and the Perspective module focused on training meta-cognitive and socio-cognitive skills such as perspective-taking on aspects of self and others. The different modules lasted for 3 months each, and consisted of a combination of classic meditation practices performed alone and partner-based interpersonal exercises. For example, the compassion-based Affect Module incorporated a specific daily exercise called the 'Affect Dyad', along with regular practice of Loving-Kindness Meditation. These specific daily interpersonal exercises, performed online with another partner, were introduced in the ReSource project in the two social modules, Affect and Perspective. These 10-minute daily \"Contemplative Dyads\" focused on explicitly fostering social connectedness and social capacities, such as empathic listening and perspective taking on others [69] . For example, the 'Affect Dyad' is a daily 10-minute, partner-based socio-emotional exercise, which fosters empathic and non-judgmental listening, acceptance of difficult emotions and cultivation of gratitude, while at the same time increasing social connectedness [69] .",

While the attention-based mindfulness module, Presence, was most efficient in increasing attention, body awareness and present-moment focus [70, 71] the compassionbased Affect module specifically targeted increases in positive other-related thoughts [70] , acceptance, self-and other-related compassion [71] [72] [73] , and altruism and prosocial behaviors [74] . Similarly, training-related changes in structural brain plasticity revealed differential patterns. While upon undergoing attention-based mindfulness practices (Presence module) grey matter volume increased in attention-relevant brain areas, after socio-emotional training (Affect module) structural plasticity was observed in limbic-and paralimbic networks associated to empathy and compassion [75] . Interestingly, and in contrast to the attention-based mindfulness module, the training modules including the social intersubjective dyad as daily core practices were most efficient in reducing social stress on the hormonal level after a social stressor [76] . Furthermore, the Affect module was found to positively influence the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies [72] . This indicates that such dyadic socio-emotional interventions may be particularly effective in decreasing social stress and loneliness, while improving social connectedness and socio-affective skills such as compassion and prosocial motivation. This in turn should boost psychological resilience and social cohesion, which are seen as key protective factors for mental well-being.",

Therefore, the singular effects of these dyadic practices are still unknown (with exception of [69] ). Furthermore, these intense training programs, where dyadic exercises are combined with other classical mindfulness meditations, last several months. They require considerable time and manpower to execute, with the participants being required to devote practice time in 3-day retreats in addition to several hours working with instructors over the weeks. Therefore, the present study will also serve as a pilot test for whether these more intensive and complex contemplative and mindfulness-based programs can be condensed into low-threshold, shorter, brief interventions that can be scaled to a larger population at low costs in online app-based formats. Furthermore, although there is considerable evidence to support the efficacy of socioemotional and mindfulness-based interventions on mental health outcomes in regular in-person formats as typically performed in non-pandemic context, there is a dearth of empirical studies focused on investigating their impact as low-threshold online interventions required during a health crisis of global scale such as the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, in the current study we want to compare the efficacy of short-term online socio-emotional versus mindfulness-based online interventions in enhancing mental health, resilience and social capacities. Specifically, in the present study, we will use some of the attention-based mindfulness practices from the Presence module of the ReSource project as part of our mindfulness-based intervention (e.g., breathing, sound and open presence meditations), and compare these to the efficiency of the daily 'Affect Dyad' practice which will form the daily core exercise of the socioemotional intervention.",

However, given the restrictions on physical contact often imposed by the current pandemic, we intend to test the effects of such interventions in an online format. Such online mental trainings would also allow easier scalability of such mindfulness-based approaches outside of a pandemic context. And indeed, a recent review indicated that digital interventions may be particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences in the current pandemic with requirements for social distancing and limited social contact in place [77] . However, most mindfulness-and compassion-based programs require regular in-person training sessions with teachers, at least to some degree. Although there is some preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions using online platforms [44] , there is a paucity of work examining the efficacy of online dyadic socio-emotional interventions. Such brief dyadic interventions, conducted purely online, might be particularly effective in the current pandemic context and also for future large-scale mental health prevention programs conducted on broader scales. As such, the present study would also importantly serve as a pilot for the future application of brief online dyadic socio-emotional interventions that are effectively applied in online-only environments, requiring no in-person contact with trainers.",

Both partners take turns speaking about the bodily experience in these two situations while the other partner listens in a non-judgmental and empathic manner. While the participants elaborate on each situation for 2.5 minutes, they are asked to focus on the recall of the bodily sensations and experience of the emotions generated during the situation with the aim to train interoceptive body awareness.

Breathing meditation (BM), for example, is a classical type of attentionbased meditation which involves 12-minute individual exercise that requires participants to focus their attention on the sensations of breathing [56] . Participants have to sustain their attention on their breath for long stretches of time, returning their attention to their breath when their mind wanders. The crucial aspect is the training of attention and interoceptive body awareness. Participants will also engage in other similar practices which will focus the attention on external experiences, such as mindfulness on sounds where the object of attention is the sounds in the environment. Finally, the participants will also be practicing open presence meditation with the attention being open to focus on all sensory internal and external stimulations being present [78, 79] .

In the ReSource project [67], the effects of mindfulness-based and socio-emotional and socio-cognitive trainings (Presence, Affect, Perspective modules) on social stress reduction measured in cortisol levels during the experience of an acute stressor (the Trier Social Stress Task; TSST) were compared, and only the socio-emotional and socio-cognitive training modules which included the daily 10-minutes partner-based dyad exercises showed reliable effects of stress reduction on the hormonal level [68, 76] . Possible underlying mechanisms of all these observed changes are purported to be a social stress buffering effect of learning through the daily dyads with other people to listen and be listened in a non-judgemental manner and to befriend yourself with your own and others vulnerability by practicing acceptance and self-compassion. Further, changes in use of emotion regulation strategies such as acceptance have been proposed [72, 82] [101] . Those possible mediators will be assessed daily before and after the socio-emotional training intervention to analyze changes and their relation to the expected decrease in stress. In the present study we expect that individuals who undergo the two training interventions will show a decrease in subjectively perceived stress. However, we expect differential changes between the intervention groups in cortisol social stress reactivity after a TSST, and diurnal cortisol stress measured by the cortisol awakening response (CAR) during two consecutive week days in the life of the participants. More specifically, and based on previous research [76], we expect that the socio-emotional Dyad-based intervention as compared to the mindfulness-based intervention will be most efficient in decreasing stress on the hormonal cortisol levels, both for the CAR and acute stress reactivity after a social stressor.",

Several studies have found an effect of mindfulness training on loneliness reduction [102] [103] [104] . In the context of performing daily 'Affect Dyads' in the ReSource project Kok and Singer [69] observed that participants after a given 10-minutes partner exercise indicated that they felt closer to the partner than before. Interestingly, they also showed that subjective connectedness even increased weekly before each Dyad and even if coupled with a new partner still unfamiliar to yourself. Similarly, over the 13 weeks of training of a module, the degree of personal disclosure, that is what participants were willing to share with the other partner, increased steadily. Thus, a sense of shared humanity and connectedness emerged throughout this socioemotional training practices. Therefore, we will also assess the social connectedness to the respective dyad partner before and after the daily dyad as well as the degree of personal disclosure that was shown during the dyad. We also expect changes in thought patterns [105] , affective states [106] and daily loneliness [107] before and after the dyad. Furthermore, we will ask participants on a weekly basis about other variables related to social connectedness, such as the frequency and quality of their social interactions [108] , the sense of belonging [109], common humanity [110], fear of compassion [111] and the social support received in stressful situations [112] . We expect that the socio-emotional training will be more efficient than the mindfulness-based intervention in reducing loneliness and increasing social connectedness. We will assess changes in the above postulated mechanistic variables suggested to mediate the reduction in loneliness in the socio-emotional training.",

Therefore, we will examine pre-post changes in depressive and anxious symptoms in our sample using Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; [113] ) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; [114] ). Previous studies using MBSR and MBCT have shown significant reductions in these symptoms [115, 116] . Similarly, studies employing socioemotional interventions have shown reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety [43, 117] . Although the mechanisms through which these changes occur are not fully clear, there is preliminary evidence suggesting the key role of changes in emotion regulation strategies used [72, 118, 119] . Therefore, in the present study, we expect an intervention-related decline in depressive and anxious symptoms, compared to retest control group, owing to a change in use of emotion regulation strategies such as increase in acceptance and decrease in rumination [72, 73, 120] . Further, we will also examine the mechanistic role of other factors that are purported to be involved in the onset and maintenance of depressive and anxious symptoms, namely cognitive control over emotions [121, 122] , psychological flexibility [123, 124] social support [125] , mindfulness [73, 120] , and worry [126] . Furthermore, daily fluctuations in affective states and thought patterns will be evaluated as potential mediators of intervention-related changes in depression and anxiety. Daily fluctuations in affective states will be assessed using the 'Affect Grid' [127] which measures both the current valence and the affective arousal. Further, we will use 'Cube of Thoughts' [100] to assess the intervention-related changes in valence (positive or negative), temporality (past-or future-oriented) and content (self-or other-related) of thoughts. Previous research has linked fluctuations in affect and thought patterns to be associated with depressive and anxious symptoms [128] [129] [130] [131] . We will examine changes in mediators using the daily and weekly EMA approaches, employing a variety of validated questionnaires (please see Measures section). Lastly, we will also examine changes in key mechanisms of negative attention bias and negative interpretation bias that underlie the onset and maintenance of depressive and anxious symptoms [132] [133] [134] . Both attention bias and interpretation bias will be assessed using the Mouse-Contingent Scrambled Sentences Task [135] .",

We will also examine pre-post changes in psychological resilience in the 3 groups using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; [136] ) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; [137] ). In the current study, we conceptualize psychological resilience both as the ability to adapt to stressful situations and also as the ability to bounce back after a stressor [28, 137, 138] . Previous studies have shown that resilience improves upon undergoing mindfulness-based interventions [62] . A key mechanism underlying this change is purported to be psychological flexibility [123, 139] . Further, socio-emotional interventions have also shown success in enhancing stress adaptation, in terms of stress reactivity, in the face of social stressors [76] . However, the effects on the ability to bounce back after a stressor, in terms of the degree of recovery from stress, remain unclear along with the mechanism underlying these changes. Positive coping styles, use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and psychological flexibility are purported to be some of the core mechanisms underlying resilience [140] . Further, other mechanisms proposed to be underlying resilience processes will also be investigated, namely cognitive control over emotions [141] , self-compassion [142, 143] , mindfulness [144] , and increase in use of adaptive and decrease in use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies [145] . Therefore, in the current study we will examine whether the change in coping strategies, such as enhanced social support, greater use of adaptive emotion regulation techniques such as acceptance, decreased use of maladaptive emotion regulations strategies such as rumination and worry, greater mindfulness and self-compassion, greater cognitive control over emotions, and improved psychological flexibility will predict pre-post changes in resilience in our intervention groups, compared to the retest control group. Furthermore, daily fluctuations in affective states and thought patterns will also be evaluated as potential mediators of intervention-related changes in resilience [146] . We will examine changes in mediators using the daily and weekly EMA approaches, employing a variety of validated questionnaires (please see Measures section). In the current study, we expect both mindfulness-based and socio-emotional interventions to produce to significant changes in resilience. However, we will investigate whether different interventions distinctly impact the two components of resilience, namely the ability to adapt to stressful situations and the ability to bounce back. Further, we again expect these changes in resilience to function through distinct mechanisms, as the type of practice will likely dictate changes in specific mechanistic domains. We expect differential changes in use of coping and emotion regulation strategies and changes in psychological flexibility depending upon the intervention group, which is expected to influence the magnitude of change in resilience in the two intervention groups. For example, while both mindfulness-based and compassion-based programs, such as MBCT and CFT, have been shown to enhance mindfulness, the effect sizes are larger for mindfulnessbased intervention [117] . However, care and compassion-based socio-emotional intervention will perhaps lead to enhanced use of coping strategies such as acceptance and obtaining social support, which will likely impact distinct components of resilience. Therefore, we expect differential effects of the different types of interventions on changes in resilience.",

            "text": "Empathy and compassion. We will also examine pre-post changes in empathy and compassion in the 3 intervention groups. It has long been argued that engaging in mindfulness practice can increase empathic functioning [147] [148] [149] [150] . However, previous findings on the effects of mindfulness interventions are somewhat inconsistent. More specifically, they suggest differential effects of different types of practices on affective and cognitive aspects of empathic functioning, and highlight shortcomings in the use of self-report measures of empathy [151] . In the ReSource project, a specific task was developed, the EmpaToM, to test differential effects of different mental training modules on different aspects of socio-emotional and socio-cognitive functioning such as empathy, compassion and Theory of Mind [152] . And indeed, while the socio-affective training module (Affect) was most efficient in improving compassion, the socio-cognitive module (Perspective) was unrivaled in improving Theory of Mind, also called cognitive empathy or cognitive perspective taking [71] . Thus, we will also employ the EmpaToM to assess differential effects of the two different intervention groups on social emotions and cognition. More specifically, based on previous evidence, a training related increase in compassion can be expected specifically for the socio-emotional 'Affect Dyad' intervention, whereas none of the interventions should induce any changes in Theory of Mind [71] . This expected increase in compassion does not only apply to compassion for others, but also to self-compassion [153] . With regard to empathy, the predictions are more complex, since previous research has clearly shown differential behavioral, subjective and neuronal patterns and mechanisms underlying empathy and compassion [154] [155] [156] . While compassion is based on care and affiliative motivational systems, it is mostly associated with positive affect and warmth, and promotes resilience, empathy, being broadly defined as affect sharing [157] . However, this can also induce negative affect, and even turn into intense feelings of anxiety and dysphoric mood, specifically when a healthy distinction between the self and others is not given [156] . Accordingly, the concept of \"empathic distress\" is a self-focused component of empathic functioning that indicates a strong and aversive reaction to the suffering of somebody else. Particularly, excessive altruism can lead to empathic distress fatigue, a state of burnout that relates to the regular exposure to others' suffering [158] . It has previously been found that empathic distress decreases in individuals who undergo MBSR and compassion trainings [89, 159] . It is expected that the compassion-based socio-emotional mental training is thus decreasing empathic distress aspects while increasing positive affect and (self)compassion. At the same time, the socio-emotional dyadic training is aiming at increasing empathic listening and with that the healthy component of empathy. Furthermore, while underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, differential changes in affect, thought patterns and emotion regulation strategies are also suggested to mediate differential intervention effects on empathy and compassion [160] . Thus, we would expect more positive other-related thoughts and more positive low-arousal affect after socio-emotional training. Besides, augmented interoceptive awareness, i.e., specifically, an increase in using the body for self-regulation, has been associated with mindfulness-based mental trainings such as the Presence module of the ReSource project that require individuals to focus on bodily sensations [83]. Previous research has repeatedly shown a positive association between interoceptive body awareness, alexithymia and empathy, which are mediated through function of the anterior insular cortex [161] [162] [163] . Using different interoceptive body awareness and regulation measures in the ReSource project, Bornemann et al. [83] [84] [85] could show that different types of mental training can indeed increase interoceptive body awareness over the training of several months, and that this increase in interoceptive body awareness and regulation goes along with a decrease in alexithymia and better emotion understanding (see also [164] ). Interestingly, these training-related increases were observed both after mindfulness-based as well as socio-emotional trainings, therefore suggesting that an increase in interoceptive awareness will be a meaningful mediation mechanism in both intervention groups. We will further examine changes in mediators using the daily and weekly EMA approaches, employing a variety of validated questionnaires (please see Measures section).",

Based on previous findings [74, 165, 166] , we expect that altruistic prosocial behavior will uniquely increase as a result of the care and compassion-based socio-emotional mental training. We will employ the Zurich Prosocial Game (ZPG) [166] and monetary distribution tasks that are suitable to measure altruistic behavior (i.e., Social Value Orientation, Social Discounting questionnaire) to test differential effects of mindfulness-based and socio-emotional mental trainings. Since altruistic prosocial behavior is based on a specific set of motivations that are directed towards caring for others [74, 167, 168] , we will investigate whether intervention-related increases in compassion mediate these effects. We further expect that the decrease in empathic distress (see above) and a concomitant increase in positive affect and other-related thought patterns will mediate training-related increases in altruistic prosocial behavior (similar to compassion). Since empathy and compassion can be considered essential for successful and beneficial social interactions [157, 169] , and compassion training may be a useful tool in promoting social relationships [170] , we will test a mediating role of frequency and quality of social interactions in a trainingrelated effect on prosocial behavior. We will examine changes in mediators using the daily and weekly EMA approaches, employing a variety of validated questionnaires (please see Measures section).",

We will also examine the impact of intervention-related changes in epigenetic markers associated with mental health, resilience and social capacities from pre-to post-intervention. Changes in psychopathology and resilience as a consequence of stress exposure can also be reflected in terms of changes in epigenome, such that transcription factor activation embedded by gene regulation and expression changes over time [171] . Epigenetic changes affect the gene transcription, not by changing the genome sequence, but by changing the accessibility of transcription regulators (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications; [172] . In conditions of chronic stress, glucocorticoids acting as transcription factors play a prominent role in inducing permanent epigenetic changes, which is evident through enrichment of the DNA methylation site of the glucocorticoid response in stress-related epigenetic changes [173] . These environment-dependent epigenetic changes are further influenced by genetic factors, such that genes, environment and epigenetics come together to produce changes [174] . Several studies have shown changes in DNA methylation following interventions for various disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [175] [176] [177] . Therefore, intervention-related changes in polyepigenetic risk markers will be evaluated preto post-intervention in the present study.",

            "text": "Inflammation. In addition to neuroendocrine and epigenetic markers of stress during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we will assess a marker of systemic inflammation, i.e., salivary levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein that signals activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. During acute stress, the brain responds with a robust inflammatory response, both centrally and in the periphery, likely to ensure survival during threat of injury [178, 179] . Psychosocial laboratory stress alone has been shown to induce a potent increase in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a, via autonomic nervous system activation and induction of NFkB signaling in immune cells [180, 181] . Glucocorticoids released during stress can exert inhibitory effects on innate immune responses. During chronic stress, however, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) may become resistant to the regulatory effects of glucocorticoids, likely in part due to ever-expression of FKBP51 protein [182] , further promoting pro-inflammatory activation [183, 184] . There are numerous reports documenting increased low-grade systemic inflammation in individuals living under conditions of chronic stress [179] and, especially, loneliness or social isolation [22] . In addition, systemic inflammation is one of the best-replicated findings in children and adults exposed to early adversity [185] . It has been suggested that peripheral cytokines may cross the blood-brain barrier, promoting neuroinflammation and further potentiating stress responses, with ultimate impact on structure and function of neural circuits implicated in behaviors of depression and anxiety [183] . Accordingly, increased levels of systemic inflammation are a cardinal feature of patients with major depression and certain anxiety disorders [186] . Anti-inflammatory medication is considered a viable treatment for affective symptoms in immune-based depression [187] . In addition, psychosocial interventions and meditation may lower systemic inflammation as a final common pathway [188] . Here, we test 1) whether chronic stress related to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, as assessed over the course of the pandemic and associated lockdowns, is associated with increased levels of systemic inflammation, i.e., salivary CRP concentrations, 2) whether this increase is accentuated in individuals with early life adversity, and 3) whether the dyadic intervention ameliorates systemic inflammation with impact on mental and physical well-being. We will explore associations of inflammation with neuroendocrine and epigenetic indices of stress, symptoms and treatment response, as well as GxE interactions.",

This allows us to incorporate extensive information about individual longitudinal change patterns in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion over the period of more than a year during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A broad range of state indicators of those constructs was assessed for 7 timepoints over a period lasting more than a year, from January 2020 to March 2021. In the first phase of the project, participants also provided self-report assessments of personality and behavioral traits (trait) associated with higher vulnerability to stress and mental health problems, resilience and social cohesion. The current study will be conducted in a sub-sample of the participants assessed in phase 1. Please see Fig 1 for a depiction of the sample recruitment for phase 1, detailing dropouts from registration to the completion of the first three timepoints of the first phase of the study. Also, please see Fig 2 for an overview of the schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments. Therefore, the longitudinal assessment of mental health, resilience and social cohesion factors from phase 1 of the project, along with the trait measures assessed in phase 1, will also be used to predict both pretest status and intervention-related changes from pre-to post-test in our variables of interest in phase 2 in an exploratory manner.",

Participants for the first phase of the project were recruited from the population of the city of Berlin, Germany. The main inclusion criteria involved being between 18 and 65 years of age, being able to understand the German language, and to be registered as a resident of the city of Berlin at the time of the assessment. We used a variety of methods for recruitment including sampling 56,000 individuals from the Berlin registration office, flyers and posters, and advertising on social media, in addition to the chainreferral method. The recruitment led to the registration of 7214 individuals to take part in the study. Out of this, only 5877 started the questionnaires, and at every block of questionnaires we saw further dropout in sample. A total of 3681 individuals completed the questionnaires for the first three timepoints of the first phase of the study. Lastly, participants were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria and for data quality reasons, leading to a final sample of 3522 individuals for the first three timepoints of the first phase of the project.

In the Affect Dyad (AD), participants perform a 12-minute partner-based exercise which involves contemplating over the experience of one difficult situation and one situation which incurred gratitude in the past 24 hours. Both partners take turns speaking about the two situations while the other partner listens in a non-judgmental manner. While the participants elaborate on the situations, they are asked to mostly focus on the bodily experience of the emotions generated during the situation. Daily practice of the dyad begins with a moment of silence wherein participants are required to center themselves and let go of the events and feelings experienced during the day thus far. After this, the first partner speaks about a difficult or stressful situation they experienced during the past 24 hours, and the emotions arising in that situation were felt in their body. While the first partner speaks, the other partner remains silent and is instructed to listen in an empathic non-judgmental manner. After speaking for 2.5 minutes about the difficult situation, the first partner then speaks about a situation that made them feel grateful or gratitude experienced in the past 24 hours, and how the emotions arising during this situation were felt in their bodily sensations. The partner once again remains silent and listens with an empathic and non-judgmental stance. Once the first partner finishes speaking about the grateful situation for 2.5 minutes, the entire procedure is then repeated with the second partner as speaker and the first partner as listener. The exercise ends with a moment of silence once again. Participants perform this daily exercise 6 times a week. Prior to each week of daily dyad practice, the participants are randomly paired to one other participant in the Affect Dyad group. The goal of the exercise is to enhance coping with difficult emotions, increase social connectedness, (self) acceptance, empathic and non-judgmental listening and gratitude.",

Participants have to sustain their attention to breath for long stretches of time, and have to return their attention to their breath when their mind wanders. Participants will also engage in other practices, such as attention-based mindfulness on sounds (object of attention is sounds in the environment) and open presence meditation (object of attention is sensations present in the inner and outer environment). Daily practice of the meditation takes place through pre-recorded exercise audios recorded by meditation trainers who guide the participants through the entire 12-minute exercise. The exercise begins with participants being asked to sit in a comfortable position that makes them relaxed yet keeps them awake and aware. They are asked to feel the contact to all the objects that their body rests on, and are asked to cultivate an attitude of dignity and receptivity towards themselves and their body. The exercise encourages them to focus their attention on their breath, and to bring back their attention to the breath when their mind has become distracted or has wandered.

Several empirical studies have provided strong evidence for poor mental well-being outcomes owing to the very high levels of stress and isolation generated as a result of the pandemic and the related lockdowns. The massive social changes induced due to measures such as physical distancing and closure of arenas of social participation, have not only impacted individual levels of stress and vulnerability, but also ushered a change in crucial societal foundation of social cohesion. Therefore, the current study will assess whether brief online interventions aimed at enhancing mental well-being, psychological resilience and social cohesion can reduce individual stress, loneliness and vulnerability and enhance individual psychological resilience, and also improve social capacities and cohesion amongst the various elements of society.",

The project applied intensive, 3-month long, in-person practice of mindfulness-based and socio-affective interventions that led to enhancement of mental well-being, social capacities such as compassion, empathy and prosocial behaviors, and reductions in a range of vulnerability factors such as stress or negative affect (68). In the current study, we plan to test whether such interventions can be beneficial and have measurable effects when delivered in a less intense, purely app-based online format, with only 12 minutes of practice per day over only a few weeks. This could allow for the development of more flexible forms of such interventions to be able to apply these on a larger scale to heterogeneous population samples. As such, we will validate whether brief, daily 12-minute online interventions that last 10 weeks can lead to prevention of maladaptive outcomes such as depression, anxiety, loneliness and stress, and lead to enhanced resilience, mental well-being as well as increased social competencies and cohesion. This will allow us to ascertain whether large-scale application of such interventions, that require minimal time and effort from participants, is feasible or not in terms of application and outcomes. The findings from the present study will also allow us to test whether such brief interventions can be applied to more clinical settings to reduce incidence of development of psychological disorders, such as major depression and generalized anxiety, in the face of more global stressors. Also, two associated questions of interest that will be answered are a) which type of mental training intervention is specifically effective in bringing about changes in which outcomes, and b) whether specific risk groups benefit more from one specific type of mindfulness-based or socio-emotional intervention. Moreover, the study will also clarify whether the biological embedding of stressful experiences, in the form of genotypic and polygenic risk markers of vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion, can be changed or reversed upon undergoing mindfulness-based and socio-emotional interventions. Lastly, the present study will also serve to advance the field of digitalized and personalized mental health interventions, which is increasingly being seen as an alternative to more traditional forms of in-person psychotherapy and interventions.
