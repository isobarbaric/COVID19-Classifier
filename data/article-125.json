To keep the data files permanent, we published all open data to the Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/ dataverse/2019ncov), an online data management and sharing platform with a permanent Digital Object Identifier number for each dataset. Finally, preliminary studies are conducted based on the shared COVID-19 datasets and revealed different spatial transmission patterns among mainland China, Italy, and the United States.",

On March 12, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic due to the rapid increase of cases across the world and growing number of affected countries (WHO, 2020b) . A coordinated global response is desperately needed to overcome this unprecedented challenge (Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020) . Consistent recording of COVID-19-related information is critically important for understanding transmissibility, risk of geographic spreading, routes of transmission, and risk factors for infection (Xu et al., 2020) .

            "text": "There are many open resources related to COVID-19 on daily infection case counts, Twitter data, population mobility data, research papers, and so on. However, those resources have several limitations: (1) the open data are deployed on different platforms without a central collection. It is hard for researchers to discover and integrate the data for their studies. (2) The data sources lack a standard for interoperability. Without a data interoperability standard, the data are heterogeneous, not comparable in their native form. (3) The open data are not deposited following the professional standard for permanent collections. Many data are published on GitHub, the world's leading software development platform without a professional management system for permanent data depository. Some data may only exist on temporary websites for a short period due to limited resource support. As a joint effort by scholars and professionals from the Center for Geographical Analysis at Harvard University, the Geo-Computation Center for Social Sciences at Wuhan University, the China Data Institute, the RMDS Lab, and some other institutions, an initiative on \"Resources for COVID-19 Study\" was sponsored by the China Data Lab project (https://projects.iq.harvard. edu/chinadatalab/resources-covid-19). The objectives of this project are: (1) to provide data support for the spatial study of COVID-19 at local, regional, and global levels with information collected and integrated from different sources; (2) to facilitate quantitative research on spatial spreading and impacts of COVID-19 with advanced methodology and technology; (3) to promote collaborative research on the spatial study of COVID-19 on the China Data Lab, Dataverse, and WorldMap platforms; and (4) to build research capacity for future collaborative projects. This article discusses the methodology and technology for collecting data from different sources, integrating data with base maps and other resources for social, economic, environmental, and health care data, publishing the standard data products on the Harvard Dataverse with unique and permanent Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for those data collections and datasets deposited on Dataverse.

            "text": "The open data resources related to COVID-19 studies that the focus of this article can be classified into the following major categories: infection cases, policy, population mobility, social media, and research articles. A list of popular COVID-19 data resources is presented in Table 1 , including data title, provider, covered region, and update frequency. The 2019-nCoV Time Series Infection Data Warehouse is one of the earliest open datasets after the COVID-19 breakout in China. It focuses on the reported cases in China and scrapes the data from DXY.cn using Python-based crawler with hourly updates (Lin, 2020) . John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) published its coronavirus repository from the beginning of February 2020. It started from case counts in China and later expanded to case counts globally, with an interactive web-based dashboard for tracking COVID-19 in real time (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020) . This dataset is widely used by many organizations. Since March 2020, the novel coronavirus outbreak in Europe became worse, with Italy at the forefront. As of 20 March, Italy is the world's center of active coronavirus cases with 42,681 active cases-more than double the number of active cases of any other countries and exceeding those of China and Iran combined (Worldometer, 2020) . Thus, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers-Department of Civil Protection in Italy is monitoring the situation and publishing province and regional-level case counts in real time on GitHub. It is helpful for scientists to explore the spreading of the virus and make predictions more precisely. With the continuing increase of confirmed cases in the United States, there are several open data sources with daily updated case counts besides John Hopkins University (JHU), such as New York Times (Times, 2020) , including confirmed and death cases at state and county levels. More countries also started to report COVID-19 case counts for their second-level administrative divisions, including Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and so on (Merli\u00e8re, 2020; Wu, Ge, Yu, & Hu, 2020) .",

It provides a systematic cross-national, cross-temporal measure for understanding how government responses have evolved over the period of the disease outbreak (University of Oxford, 2020).

In addition to medical scientists who are developing means for testing, treating, and immunization against novel coronavirus, researchers from other fields collect and share related data (such as state-and county-level confirmed/recovered/ death case counts, population mobility, hospital facilities, and other socioeconomic data) for exploring spreading patterns and impact factors of coronavirus (e.g., policy, environmental, and socioeconomic factors), supporting decision-making and preparedness. Dong et al. (2020) developed an interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time, aiding visualization of the virus transmission in the spatiotemporal context. In the earth science domain, Luo et al. collected temperature data and humidity data to address the role of absolute humidity on transmission rate of the COVID-19 outbreak at province level and found that changes in weather alone does not necessarily lead to decline in COVID-19 case counts (Luo et al., 2020) . Sajadi et al. (2020) predicted spreading and seasonality of COVID-19 using temperature and latitude and pointed out a zone at increased risk for COVID-19 spreading. Wang et al. investigated the influence of air temperature and relative humidity and found that high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, from which they concluded that the arrival of summer and rainy seasons in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 (Wang, Tang, Feng, & Lv, 2020) . To compare the environmental changes before and during the pandemic in mainland China, Liu et al. (2020) investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of Nighttime Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI). In the public health domain, many researchers focus on comparing infected cases before and after the announcement of social distancing policies. Wells et al. estimated the impact of travel restrictions and border control measures and concluded that reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and buy time for public health responses (Wells et al., 2020) . Tian et al. (2020) evaluated travel restrictions of Wuhan City in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak and discovered that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of novel coronavirus from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). Similarly, Chinazzi et al. found that the Wuhan travel quarantine delayed the epidemic progression in mainland China by only 3-5 days and had significant effect at the international scale (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . Transportation data also play an important role in analyzing the transmission of COVID-19. Bogoch et al. (2020) evaluated the potential dissemination of COVID-19 across the world via commercial air travel at the early stage of epidemic and stated that major Asian hubs are the most probable sites of exportation.",

Human mobility causes the spreading of contagious diseases. Meanwhile, the recovered and death cases are closely related to capacity at health facilities. This project also collected medical health facilities data (such as hospital) to support further analysis. Mobile social media, especially those with geolocations, contain valuable data for analyzing human behavior and events in the real world (Fujita, 2013) . Monitoring public opinion and sentiment variations using social media data is also important for decision-makers to track people's reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak, especially what topics people care about the most (Hu, She, Duan, Yue, & Clunis, 2019) . Several studies have shown that climate has close relations with the spreading of COVID-19. Considering the potential relevance of various data in COVID-19 research, we collected different data from various sources, including infection cases, socioeconomic data, social media, scholarly articles, population mobility, global news, health facilities, and climate. Figure 1 presents the framework for collecting and managing these data resources. According to the features of these resources, we applied different methodologies to collect the data. Some resources provide structured data in the format of csv, excel, and JSON, such as COVID-19 infection cases, climate, scholarly articles, and socioeconomic data; some resources provide web service API to access the data, such as Twitter or health facilities POI data; some resources are web pages that do not have data access interfaces, such as Baidu population mobility data, thus web scrapers are developed to collect the data.

For the US data files, such as daily cases and socioeconomic data, the raw data include state and county's Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, thus the data can be matched with the US base maps by the FIPS code. For the China data files, such as China's daily cases, health facilities, climate, policies, and regulations, as well as global daily cases retrieved from JHU, the raw data do not provide province/city codes, thus denoting place name matching is the only way to match the records. Figure 5 presents the matching method. In the data files and base maps, some administrative unit names are spelled the same, thus they can be matched easily. However, when the place names are spelled with variations, we created a mapping list to facilitate the matching. Each row of the mapping list records the same place with different names from data files and base maps. For example, when mapping global cases with a global base maps, the country \"Congo\" in the global daily cases file needs to match with \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" in the base map. Thus, \"Congo\" and \"Democratic Republic of Congo\" will be added as a record in the mapping list. ",

We applied the queen-based spatial weight matrix that defines two areas as neighbors when both share a border or vertex. (Anselin, 2010) . Figures 10-12 show the spatial patterns of confirmed virus cases in mainland China, Italy, and the United States at similar time points. The starting time is chosen to be when the total number of confirmed cases reaches 100 for each country. The dates are January 18, 2020 in mainland China, February 25, 2020 in Italy, and March 2, 2020 in the United States. To explore the spatial distribution patterns of COVID-19 over time, we calculate and visualize results from LISA tests every 10 days. As shown in Figure 10 , the initial hot spot in mainland China is concentrated in Wuhan. After 10 days, the hot spots start to emerge in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong areas. The hot spot in Wuhan spread rapidly to nearby cities and provinces. Since then, these hot spots stay mostly unchanged, which might be related to the strict lockdown policies. The Moran coefficient starts with -0.004 on January 18, 2020, and then rise to 0.553 on January 28, 2020, indicating a strong and positive spatial autocorrelation. On February 17, 2020, the coefficient grows to 0.625 suggesting an increasingly strong spatial autocorrelation. The cases in Italy exhibit similar patterns as shown in Figure 11 . The single largest hot spot remains in north Italy and is gradually expanding to nearby regions. Figure 12 presents the spatial trends in the United States. Small hot spots first appear in the states Washington and California. After 10 days, several other hot spots start to emerge in Michigan, Florida, and New York. These hot spots span rapidly and grow into large regional clusters. The hot spots continue to expand after 30 days. ",

Understanding its transmissibility, risk of geographic spreading, routes of transmission, risk factors for infections, and economic impacts of COVID-19 are among the critical issues for current and future control of the outbreaks (Xu et al., 2020) . Data sharing allows creative innovation from archival datasets, generation of new knowledge, promotion of new discoveries, formulation of new hypotheses, creation of new meanings by connecting existing datasets, and verification of existing results (Aleixandre-Benavent, Vidal-Infer, Alonso-Arroyo, Peset, & Ferrer Sapena, 2020) . This study introduces the process of collecting data from different sources, including daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, global news, social media data, population mobility, climate, health facilities, socioeconomic data, events chronicle, and scholarly articles. To keep the data files for permanent collections, we deposited the data to the Harvard Dataverse, an open online data management and sharing platform with a permanent DOI number for each dataset. Within the first 2 months, the data files have been downloaded over 160,000 times by users from more than 120 countries.",

The hot spots of confirmed cases are diversified in different locations of the United States, including California, Washington, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Illinois. It is important to understand the driving factors of those differences, such as policies, population mobility, health facilities, locations, climate, and so on.
