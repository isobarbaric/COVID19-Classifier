The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more a ected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less a ected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities.",

When the epidemic spreads across national borders and infects people worldwide, it is termed a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, the virus spreading COVID-19, for example, possessed the right characteristics to turn its associated disease into a pandemic: people carrying the virus do not show symptoms for an average of ve days, during which they can spread the virus to others [44] ; its basic reproduction number has been estimated between 1.4 and 5.7, i.e., each infected person in turns infects an average of up to 5.7 people [33] ; up to 44% of patients show no symptoms at all during the infection period, making their diagnosis di cult [29] .",

For this brief introduction, we call the four nucleotides composing the RNA chain with their initials: A, C, G, U. The quickest available test for RNA viruses uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). A popular test consists in collecting a sample of nasal secretions on a swab [7] , looking for an RNA subsequence which is unique to the virus. To identify this subsequence, the tester uses inverse RNA: a sequence of nucleotides which pairs those they are looking for (remember that A pairs with U and C with G). If the sample contains viral RNA, it will pair with the chain injected by the tester. Once the nucleotides are paired, they e ectively transform the single-strand RNA into double-strand DNA. To detect a signi cant presence of the viral DNA, the genetic material goes through an ampli cation process, the polymerase chain reaction [6] . Both transforming RNA into DNA, and amplifying it, cannot happen without certain enzymes, commonly called reagents. While this simpli ed description is enough to introduce our problem, we refer the reader to the reviews of Bustin [4] and Freeman, Walker, and Vrana [16] for a more accurate description of the rRT-PCR technique. Figure 1 is an example of a protocol for rRT-PCR tests used by the United Kingdom's National Health Service. During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory capacities and reagent availability have become the bottleneck for increasing the number of tests in much of Europe, North America and Asia [13, 1, 43, 27] . Therefore, health authorities need to optimise the allocation of resources to their test laboratories, starting from the distribution of reagent and the assignments of testing tasks. With this work, we use tools from Operational Research to help decision makers maximise the number of tests they can conduct while limited by reagent availability and logistic constraints.",

To this end, we do not consider transport, production, storage, raw material, order placement, personnel, nor opportunity costs, which instead have a prominent role when optimising commercial supply chains and production processes. In the standard case, in fact, the aim of the planner is pure cost minimisation [30] and satisfying the demand in full could even be sub-optimal, if the cost of producing one more unit is larger than the opportunity cost of missing a sale. Other approaches commonly used in production planning include multi-objective optimisation in which cost minimisation is tackled together with secondary objectives, such as demand satisfaction [26] , steadiness of production rates [40] or environmental performance [2] . Even in the healthcare sector, if considering times when authorities are not responding to an emergency, costs are taken into account. For example, Zhao et al. [48] consider a drugs production planning problem in which they minimise both costs (avoiding over-production of drugs) and the duration of the trial. Other works (e.g., [10, 14] ) have considered the production and supply optimisation problems in the clinical area, but have focused on production and distribution of drugs in \"normal\" times, rather than during an emergency response to a sudden epidemic event.",

The capacity of the central lab limits, in this case, the number of total expected positive results coming from all other labs in the country.

The rst uses the o cial numbers released by Italy's \"Dipartimento della Protezione Civile\", which we refer to as Real Data. Next, we consider the output obtained by the Hierarchical Model, under the following hypotheses. Swabs collected in a region cannot be sent to other regions, but can be allocated to any laboratory within the collection region (for this reason we label this data as Model -Regional). In modelling terms, this corresponds to setting \u00b5 l 1 l 2 = 1 if and only if, for two labs l 1 , l 2 \u2208 L, there is a region L k such that l 1 , l 2 \u2208 L k . We use this hypothesis to model how testing happens in Italy, with local laboratories and regional \"reference laboratories\" collecting swabs from all-over the region and providing double checks before non-urgent hospital admissions (emergency patients are admitted even before test results are ready) and discharges. Also remind that the Italian healthcare system is managed on a regional basis, with ample autonomy given to the local health authorities but little inter-regional interaction [15] . We assume that labs can procure reagent from their geographically closest factory, and that procurement is optimised by a planner deciding the quantities of reagent sent to each laboratory, to maximise the number of tested swabs. This assumption re ects how Italian regions were procuring supplies autonomously, before the central government created and rendered operational a COVID-19 Commissariat which also acted as a national procurement centre [11, Art. 122 ].",

            "text": "Because news sources and press releases by regional health authorities (we found statements by authorities of Basilicata, Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Marche, Lombardia, Piemonte, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicilia, Toscana, Umbria and Veneto, i.e., 12 out of the 20 Italian regions) hint that reagent was a major bottleneck in expanding test capabilities, we expect this model to be able to increase the number of swabs tested even if it does not allow inter-regional swab reassignment, just by optimising reagent assignment. Figure 5a shows how laboratories cluster within each region: an edge between two laboratories means that they belong to the same region. Finally, we consider the output obtained from the Hierarchical Model, but allowing for reallocation of swabs between laboratories in di erent regions. This assumption e ectively means that regional daily demand can be shared across regions. Because swabs would need to move within a short time (e.g., overnight) we put limitations on the inter-laboratory distance that allows swab transfer. We consider three thresholds of 100Km, 200Km and 400Km and we denote the corresponding data as Model -100Km, Model -200Km and Model -400Km. (We make an exception for the island region of Sardinia, for which moving swabs outside of the region would be unfeasible even if there are other laboratories within 400Km.) Figure 5b shows how laboratories can transfer swabs when using the 200Km threshold. Compare Figures 5a and 5b to note how inter-regional collaboration gives a central planner more opportunities to move swabs between regions in case there should be a day with a demand peak in a particular area. We refer the reader to [35] for the full description of the instance generation process and to [34] for an interactive dashboard presenting the results of the analysis. Figure 6 shows the number of swabs tested, day-by-day, when using our proposed models Regional, 100Km, 200Km, and 400Km. Note how Model -400Km fully uses the system's capacity during the last period of the time horizon, where the number of tested swabs becomes a at line. During some days, a model with fewer lab transfer capabilities gives more tested swabs than a model in which more transfers are allowed. For example, on April 6, using Model -400Km results in fewer tests than Model -200Km and Model -100Km. This is not surprising if we consider that the models maximise the number of swabs tested over the whole planning horizon, even if this results in fewer tests on any particular day. Table 1 reports detailed results of the analysis. Each row corresponds to one day, and the columns list the real data and the results obtained using the model. Columns #tests report the number of swabs tested during that day. Columns %gain are the percentage gains obtained using the models, compared to the number of swabs actually tested in Italy in the described period. The last row gives aggregate results for the whole country. Note how using optimisation techniques results in a testing capacity increase between 14% and 39%, under the hypotheses explained above. In particular, assuming that tests in Italy were largely limited by the unavailability of reagent due to a poor allocation of supplies and low inter-regional collaboration, optimising these two aspects can allow to perform up to 250 000 more tests (the increase between Real Data and Model -400Km) during 13 days. Figure 7 shows example results from the Regional and 400Km models, for four representative Italian regions from the north (Piemonte and Emilia-Romagna), the centre (Lazio) and the south (Sicilia) of the country. Each Model with intra-regional (orange column) and inter-regional (green, pink and blue lines) swab transfers. line inter-regional transfer radii considered are 100, 200 and 400Km. chart reports the number of swabs analysed per day. Note how, for three of the four regions, the results of the Regional model agree with the real data, validating our modelling assumptions and hinting that regions managed resources locally e ciently. In all four regions, during the last period of the planning horizon, the models use the full laboratory capacity and their curves appear at, i.e., the limiting factor is not reagent availability anymore, but structural limitations such as testing machines or lab personnel. Note how, in Sicily during the middle period, the 400Km model provides a solution with fewer tested swabs than the Regional model and the Real Data, for two days. However, there was a catch-up on the tests during the last part of the planning horizon, resulting in more tests carried out in total.",

A better testing capacity depends on both structural factors (such as a strong reagent industrial base) which require long-term decisions, and organisational factors (such as more inter-regional collaboration) which are in uenced by operational decisions. Figure 9 shows the percentage of swabs tested within the end of the time horizon, over all the swabs collected and available for testing. In other words, if the planner manages to allocate swabs to laboratories in such a way that all swabs are tested within the considered time horizon, then this percentage would be 100%. Each chart corresponds to one parameter; we use line charts for the seven numeric parameters, and box plots for \u03bb PP and \u03bb TS , which are categorical. In each chart, the x axis reports the value taken by the parameter. The axis reports the percentage of swabs tested when solving instances generated with the corresponding parameter. For the line charts, the solid line denotes the average percentage of swabs tested over all instances generated with the given parameter value, while the shaded area is the 95% con dence interval obtained via bootstrapping (using 1000 iterations). For the box plots, each box denotes the two central quartiles, the horizontal line is the median, and whiskers extend to the rest of the distribution. Figure 9 : Variation in the percentage of swabs tested ( axis), when varying each parameter (x axis). In each chart, the line shows the average over all instances generated with the given parameter value and the shaded area around the line is the 95% con dence interval. For parameters \u03bb PP and \u03bb TS , as they take categorical values, we show a box plot instead of a line plot. The central line indicates the median, the box spans the two central quartiles, while whiskers extend to the rest of the distribution (excluding outliers).",

The average percentage of swabs tested when \u03bb PP = steady is double than when \u03bb PP = bumpy. Recall that a factory in our model can represent a real production site, but also a warehouse or a shipment from abroad. A physical factory will be able to maintain a steadier production rate, while relying on shipments will resemble more the \"bumpy\" scenario. The analysis, thus, hints to the fact that a solid industrial sector and a well-function supply chain can have the greatest impact on testing capacity; not necessarily because they allow to procure more reagent in total, but because they provide a steadier ow of it. A country that cannot count on such production capacity can mitigate the adverse e ects of irregular supply with larger orders (see the positive impact of parameter \u03bb FP ), more inventory capacity and a quick dispatch of reagent to labs.",

Other two factors which impact the amount of swabs tested are lab capacity and the degree to which regions can share this capacity by transferring swabs between each other. Parameter \u03bb LC clearly in uences testing capabilities: for \u03bb LC < 1 largely less than half of the swabs are tested within the end of the time horizon. When \u03bb LC \u2265 1, i.e., when the total lab capacity is at least as large as the average demand, gains are marginal, as exhibited by the curve attening in Figure 9 . It is at this point that we would expect capacity sharing via increased inter-regional collaboration to have the greatest e ect. The extent at which capacity is shared depends on parameter \u03bb LL . It might appear, looking at Figure 9 , that the impact of \u03bb LL is small. However, if we divide the analysis of its impact between instances with \u03bb LC < 1 and instances with \u03bb LC \u2265 1, the situation is di erent, as reported in Figure 10 . Note how the curve referring to instances with \u03bb LC \u2265 1 is much steeper, corresponding to a larger percentage increase in swabs tested. We can conclude that countries with insu cient lab infrastructures should primarily focus on procuring test machinery and training personnel to carry out rRT-PCR tests.

Allowing transshipments produces an increase in swabs tested, from 43.30% to 45.85% on average (an increase of +5.03%), placing parameter \u03bb TS 's impact behind several others. We suspect that the reason is that there are few cases in which moving reagent in one direction gives di erent results compared to moving swabs in the opposite direction, as mentioned in Section 5.2. Transshipments' e ect is larger if we focus on instances with bumpy reagent production. In this case they increase the number of swabs tested by +11.14%. This result suggests that transshipments can smooth irregular production patterns: a country which cannot procure reagent steadily should increase internal collaboration by moving both swabs and reagent. The percentage of swabs tested decreases when there are fewer, larger regions (parameter \u03bb L\u00d7R ). This is because, with fewer regions, the impact of one region being critical, i.e., with larger demands m it , is proportionally larger. The e ect of region size is rather modest, as indicated by a small regression coe cient associated with \u03bb L\u00d7R . Regarding the planning horizon length |T |, its impact is unclear. On one hand, a longer time horizon allows more opportunities for optimisation. On the other hand, there is a reduction in tested swabs when moving from |T | = 5 to |T | = 7, which is hard to explain. In practice, a planner would want to balance the advantages usually conferred by longer-term planning with the quality of the demand predictions that he can obtain from epidemiological models. Finally, while the signs of the regression coe cients in the two regression analyses tend to coincide (meaning that parameters which have a positive impact on the number of swabs tested also have a positive impact on shortening wait times), the signs disagree for parameters \u03bb L\u00d7R and |T |, making it di cult to derive actionable recommendations for decision makers based on these two parameters.

However, because antibodies persist in the blood even after a patient does not host the virus any longer, health authorities use immunological tests for mass-screening of populations (including asymptomatic patients) with the aim of assessing the prevalence of the virus, the level of population immunity and other epidemiological dynamics. It would be interesting to study not only how to increase capacity for immunological tests, but also to study the problem of selecting the patients to test with higher priority, in order to create an accurate epidemiological picture of the population while using a restricted supply of antibody tests such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [41] or neutralization assays [45] .",
