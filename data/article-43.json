            "text": "The genera Pestivirus, Hepacivirus and Flavivirus are grouped together in the family Flaviviridae. Pestiviruses are bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV-1, BVDV-2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus of sheep (BDV). The single-stranded RNA genome of pestiviruses contains one long open reading frame (ORF) with about 4000 codons. The putative polyprotein is cleaved co-and post-translationally by host cell-and virus-encoded proteases. The existence of a chymotrypsin-or trypsin-like serine protease in the N-terminal domain of pestiviral nonstructural protein NS3 (p80) was predicted by comparative amino acid pattern analyses [1, 2] . Subsequently, transient expression studies in the T7 vaccinia virus system [3\u00c05] and expression via baculovirus recombinants [6] provided experimental evidence for this assumption. The studies revealed that NS2-3 (p125) as well as NS3 are proteolytically active serine proteases. The serine protease domain residing in NS2-3/ NS3 is essential for processing of the polyprotein downstream of NS2-3 and, with respect to genomic localization, function and amino acid motifs is homologous to the NS3 serine proteases of hepaciviruses (Chapter 688) and flaviviruses (Chapter 687)."

            "text": "Within the family Flaviviridae, the existence of unprocessed NS2-3 as a mature viral protein is unique for pestiviruses. It was demonstrated for BVDV and CSFV that uncleaved NS2-3 is essential for the production of infectious virions [7, 8] . Moreover a cellular chaperone of the J-domain family can induce NS2-3 cleavage in cis or in trans [9] . It turned out that this chaperone acts as cofactor of a viral autoprotease residing in NS2 [10, 11] . The limiting amounts of this cellular cofactor available in the infected cell are responsible for the observed temporal modulation of NS2-3 cleavage by the NS2 protease [12] . Accordingly, in noncytopathogenic (noncp) pestivirusinfected cell cultures efficient NS2-3 cleavage and thereby NS3 release is only observed in the first hours after infection. Even though uncleaved NS2-3 is present in pestivirus-infected cells, certain pestivirus isolates have evolved mechanisms for a highly efficient release of NS3 from the polyprotein (see Further Reading below). Interestingly, high-level expression of NS3 is correlated with cytopathogenicity of the respective viruses."

At P1 0 Ala is found in almost all pestiviral isolates at the NS4A-4B site; isolate Bungowannah [20] is an exception coding for Ser at this position.

The N-terminal part of NS2 is highly hydrophobic leading to anchoring of NS2/NS2-3 to intracellular membranes. It is assumed that the C termini of NS2-3 and NS3 are identical. Protein sequencing approaches identified Gly1590 (numbering according to noncp BVDV strain SD-1 [25] ) as the N terminus of NS3 of two cp BVDV strains [14, 15] . The genome structures of cp pestiviruses imply that also in most other cases Gly1590 represents the N-terminal amino acid of NS3 [13] . Accordingly, NS2-3 and NS3 of BVDV exhibit lengths of 1137 and 684 amino acids, respectively. While NS3 starting with Gly1590 is catalytically active at all cleavage sites, N-terminal truncation of NS3 by only 6 amino acids led to a strongly reduced cleavage selectively at the NS4A-4B site [17] . After a deletion of the Nterminal 20 amino acids only NS3 and a minor amount of NS5B were released from the polyprotein. An N-terminal truncation by 45 amino acids finally interfered also with the cis-cleavage at site NS3-4A. The minimal NS3 serine protease domain shown to be active in trans on an NS5A-5B substrate encompasses so far 209 amino acids [17] . However, it should be pointed out that for pestiviral RNA replication the authentic N terminus of NS3 is essential [26] ."

            "text": "For flaviviruses and HCV the minimal length of a catalytically active NS3 serine protease is about 180 amino acids [27, 28] . Thus the length of the serine protease is very similar for all members of the Flaviviridae. A model developed by Gorbalenya and coworkers ([29] ; see also Bazan & Fletterick [1] ) proposed for the pestiviral protease a catalytic triad consisting of His1658, Asp1686 and Ser1752. Mutagenesis studies revealed that His1658 and Ser1752 are indispensable for all cleavages mediated by the NS2-3/NS3 serine protease. In contrast, Asp1686 was not essential for cis cleavage at the NS2-3/NS3-4A site but for all other cleavages. An exchange of Ser1752 by Cys led to a protease with significant (cis) activity at the NS2-3/NS3-4A site. Interestingly, also the replacement of Ser1752 by Thr yielded detectable cleavage at this site even though at strongly reduced levels [17] . This unusual finding is reminiscent of an earlier report [30] for the capsid protease of Sindbis virus (Chapter 504), an alphavirus of the family Togaviridae underlining the similarity between these proteases as proposed earlier."

NS4A has a length of 64 amino acids [4, 5] ; the cofactor function has been mapped to a 38-amino-acid peptide in the middle of NS4A [5] . NS4A is essential at least for the cleavages at the NS4B-5A and the NS5A-5B sites [4] . It is still unclear whether the NS4A cofactor is also essential for the cleavages at the NS3-4A and NS4A-4B sites. N-terminally truncated NS4A-4B no longer encompassing an active NS4A cofactor domain was no substrate for the NS2-3/NS3 serine protease; however, in this assay cleavage could not be restored by co-expression of authentic NS4A (Tautz, N., unpublished data). Accordingly, the cofactor requirements in this processing step are still to be determined."
