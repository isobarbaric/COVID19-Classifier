In fact, there are numerous examples throughout history in which convalescent serum was used with some degree of success to treat an array of diseases, including rheumatic fever [16] , scarlet fever [17] , mumps [18] , measles [18, 19] , chickenpox [18] , and pneumococcal and meningococcal infections [20] (Fig 1) . Most notable use was during the Spanish Flu pandemic (1918 to 1920) , where meta-analysis studies showed a significantly reduced mortality risk in patients treated with convalescent serum [8, 12] . However, with the advent of antimicrobials, by the middle of the 20th century, the use of serum therapy had declined. Nevertheless, the interest in passive antibody therapy has been renewed periodically when new epidemics or pandemics have emerged. One example is during the Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an infected laboratory worker recovered after transfusion with convalescent plasma containing anti-EBOV antibodies. Similarly, in 1979, patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever virus treated with convalescent plasma had a lower mortality rate compared with subjects treated with normal plasma, and similar results were reported for subsequent epidemics of the disease [21] . Over the following decades, convalescent plasma therapy was successfully employed during the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic (2009), the H5N1 avian flu epidemic (2003), as well as during the EBOV outbreak in West Africa in 2013.

            "text": "The convalescent plasma therapeutic approach is based on the principle of passive antibody therapy, a short-term strategy whereby antibodies from the blood of someone who recovered from an infection can be administered to protect or treat another person [6, 21] . Effectively, the end goal is the same as vaccines, making antibodies against a specific infectious agent readily available. For instance, a vaccine relies on the host immune cells (B lymphocytes specifically) to produce antibodies after antigen recognition and signal amplification by the immune system, a process that may take weeks [24] ; on the other hand, in the case of passive antibody therapy, the process is expedited by providing a patient with immediate immunity when the premade antibodies are given. Therefore, for COVID-19 patients, the expedited approach could prove lifesaving. Nevertheless, this advantage does not come without caveats, as immunization with passive antibody therapy is typically of shorter-term protection, in part because of the half-life of antibodies in circulation [25] and lack of new production by B lymphocytes. Today, passive antibody therapy relies primarily on pooled immunoglobulin preparations that contain high concentrations of antibodies. In contrast, plasma has been used emergently in epidemics in which there is insufficient time or resources to generate immunoglobulin preparations [21] ."

However, potential COVID-19 donors must meet several eligibility criteria that ensure the donor has antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and lacks the presence of other types of infections [21, 27] . Additionally, only plasma with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) are used. Once collected, plasma can be tested and administered within hours, following conventional donor-patient blood compatibility typing [27] . In addition to rapid mobilization, this therapeutic approach is also versatile in applicability as it can be used for prophylaxis or treatment, as illustrated in Fig 2. In the case of prophylaxis, a subject considered at high risk for infection (because of age or underlying medical conditions or who is likely to be in contact with people with COVID-19) could be administered convalescent plasma or neutralizing antibodies for protection against infection. Alternatively, plasma can be administered to treat subjects who have contracted the infection but have not made sufficient antibodies against the virus yet in order to augment their immune response, improve disease course, and enhance recovery [21] . However, it is important to note that passive antibody therapy is most effective when administered prophylactically or implemented early after the onset of symptoms [21] ."

            "text": "Although convalescent plasma therapy is considered a relatively safe therapeutic modality, there are some potential risks [12] . One theoretical complication that may arise is an antibodymediated proinflammatory disease enhancement known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), whereby antibodies that developed during a prior infection exacerbate severity of the disease [12, 28] . The transfer of these antibodies may aberrantly activate fragment crystallizable (Fc) or complement receptors, increasing recruitment of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to the site of infection and causing severe tissue damage [29] [30] [31] . Additionally, the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies may exacerbate viral endocytosis or phagocytosis into host cells via Fc receptors, potentializing viral replication [29, 32] . However, although this phenomenon is well known with Dengue and other viral diseases, there have not been any reported ADE cases with the use of convalescent plasma for SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 [12, 29, [32] [33] [34] [35] . Nevertheless, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the role of the recipients' immune response [12] . Transmission of the virus through transfusion is another concern; however, the risk is relatively low because of strict transfusion protocols, and when used for treatment purposes, the recipient is already infected [12, 36] ."

Apheresis is an automated technology that allows for selective collection of a blood fraction while other components can be transfused back to the donor. Therefore, for donation of convalescent plasma, plasmapheresis is recommended because it is highly efficient and approximately 400-800 mL of plasma can be collected in a single donation, providing 2-4 units of convalescent plasma for transfusion [21] . There are some practical and logistical limitations for the implementation of a large-scale convalescent plasma transfusion program such as training of study personnel, recruitment of donors, and transport of plasma to hospitals, as well considerations for plasma shelf-life and half-life of antibodies in the plasma [21, 36] ."

By analyzing key safety metrics following transfusion of convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, the incidence of serious adverse events was found to be <1%, and the 7-day mortality incidence was 14.9%. These early indicators are encouraging and highly supportive of the use of convalescent plasma as a rescue therapy in hospitalized patients, given that the reported fatality rate of COVID-19 among patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) is 57% [37] . In fact, the low risk indicated by the study support expanding the use of convalescent plasma therapy in less ill individuals [6] ."

Although its efficacy and safety have not yet been fully proven, convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients is projected to be a safe and potentially effective therapy for prophylaxis and treatment. However, it is critically important to perform rigorous randomized controlled trials to confirm efficacy and safety and to provide evidence for improved meaningful clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, despite the nuanced challenges, the substantial evidence of benefit with use for prior viral infections offers strong precedent for convalescent plasma as a therapeutic approach. Importantly, efforts should be focused not only on evaluation of the feasibility of plasma treatment for infectious diseases but also ensure that use of convalescent plasma therapy takes place according to ethical and controlled conditions."
