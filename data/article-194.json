In contrast, adults aged 18-49 years have made up 13%-23% of patients hospitalized with influenza over the past 5 seasons [5] . In this convenience sample, approximately 14% of adults aged 18-49 years had no underlying medical conditions. Although in-hospital deaths were rare, 22% of these healthy, younger adults were admitted to the ICU, and 17% required invasive or noninvasive respiratory support, excluding oxygen administered by nasal cannula. These findings suggest that adults aged 18-49 years without underlying medical conditions can experience severe COVID-19-related illness. While evidence shows that older age and certain underlying conditions are risk factors for severe COVID-19 [2, 3] , the mechanisms behind severe COVID-19 in younger adults without underlying conditions is not well understood. Emerging evidence suggests that biological factors may explain why some individuals develop severe COVID-19 and others do not. One biological factor that may explain individual differences in COVID-19 severity is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a known receptor of coronavirus that facilitates entry of the virus into host cells [6] such that individuals with higher levels of ACE2 may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence suggests that ACE2 levels may be influenced by sex hormones, with males showing increased ACE2 expression compared with females [7] . These sex differences in ACE2 and the role of sex hormones have been offered as potential biological explanations for the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in males [7, 8] . In our analysis, we found that approximately 74% of adults aged 18-49 years without underlying conditions who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were males. These findings suggest that, in the absence of underlying conditions, male sex may increase the risk of severe COVID-19, leading to hospitalization and the need for intensive care in adults aged <50 years [8, 9] ."

[10] , and our earlier report [3] indicate that COVID-19 disproportionately affects minority populations including Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic Black or African American persons. In the present study, we found that although Hispanic or Latino persons represent only 16% of the 18-to 49-year-old population under surveillance within the COVID-NET catchment area, 42% of hospitalized adults aged 18-49 years without underlying conditions in the COVID-NET study sample were Hispanic or Latino. To determine whether our convenience sampling over-selected for Hispanic or Latino persons, we compared the proportions of patients aged 18-49 years who were Hispanic or Latino among those with and without completed medical chart abstractions, and found the proportions to be 35% and 42%, respectively, indicating that we did not over-select Hispanic or Latino persons. (Supplementary Table 2 ). One possible explanation for the observed disparities is that younger Hispanic or Latino adults are overrepresented in occupations with limited opportunities for social distancing [11, 12] , which may place them at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 There are several limitations to this analysis. Since SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted at the discretion of healthcare providers, COVID-NET may not capture all COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. We included a convenience sample of hospitalized patients with a discharge disposition and for whom completed medical chart abstractions were available; therefore, our findings may not be representative of all patients aged 18-49 years who reside within the COVID-NET catchment area or hospitalized with COVID-19. Although COVID-NET covers about 10% of the US population, its limited geographic coverage means that the findings may not be generalizable to the US population. While detailed chart abstractions were conducted to ascertain the presence of underlying conditions at admission, it is possible that persons from certain racial and ethnic minority groups may have had undiagnosed underlying medical conditions due to limited healthcare access, leading to possible misclassification and inclusion of some patients in our analysis with undiagnosed medical conditions."
