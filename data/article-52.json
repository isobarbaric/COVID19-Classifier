            "text": "Objective To systematically identify and critically appraise the methodological quality of pediatric guidelines applicable to management of COVID-19 in India. Methods Pediatric COVID-19 guidelines applicable to India, published until 30 April 2021, were identified through a systematic search across ten databases. Each was critically appraised for methodological quality using the AGREE-II tool, by at least two appraisers. Median (interquartile range) of the total score and domain-wise scores were calculated, and compared for Indian vs. foreign guidelines, updated vs. original versions of guidelines, and those developed earlier vs. later in the pandemic. Results A total of 62 guidelines was identified. Only 8 (12.9%) were published in India. The overall AGREE-II score ranged from 4.7% to 72.8%; with median (IQR) 37.9% (29.4, 48.6). This suggested overall low(er) methodological quality. The median (IQR) domain-wise scores were as follows: Scope and Purpose 66.0, 45.8). This suggested diversity in quality of different aspects of the guidelines, with very low quality in the critical domain of methodological rigor. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall scores of Indian vs. foreign guidelines, updated versions vs. original versions, and those developed earlier vs. later in the pandemic. Conclusion The currently available pediatric COVID-19 guidelines have low methodological quality, adversely affecting their credibility, validity, and applicability. Urgent corrective strategies are presented for consideration."

Governmental agencies, public health institutions, and professional societies, struggled to meet the challenges of the pandemic by rapidly developing guidelines to assist health care providers and the public [2] ."

Such guidelines produce evidence-based recommendations, coupled with judgements on the evidence strength and quality [2] . In contrast, the urgency created by the pandemic resulted in the publication of a large number of documents bypassing the formal process, but labelled as guidelines [3] . Sadly, these well-intentioned (and sometimes helpful) documents may not be entirely trustworthy, due to methodological limitations, or conflicts of interest [2] . In some situations, they may result in implementing strategies that are not only ineffective, but possibly harmful [4] . The situation is worse for pediatric guidelines owing to the limited quantity and quality of primary evidence in children. Therefore, many pediatric guidelines have either been extrapolated from adult studies or are based on 'expert opinions,' adversely affecting their reliability. Even well-developed guidelines are generally applicable for the healthcare settings for which they are developed. However, during the COVID pandemic, many guidelines developed for entirely different settings were freely extrapolated to other settings."

First, is the problem unique to COVID guidelines? Most COVID-19 guidelines were developed under challenging circumstances of a raging pandemic by a hitherto unknown virus, urgent need for guidance despite lack of robust evidence, and the need for policy-makers and healthcare professionals to take action. However, this perception is belied by the authors' observation that guidelines developed later during the pandemic also did not show better methodological quality, nor did those that were revised or updated. Further, these are specific processes for the rapid development of guidelines to meet public health emergencies [23, 24] . In addition, comparison of guidelines developed for viral outbreaks causing public health emergencies, showed that the methodological quality of COVID guidelines was inferior to those developed for outbreaks of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, and Zika virus [25] . These diverse pieces of evidence suggest that the COVID-19 guidelines are somehow especially inferior in quality. The second question is why this is happening. It could be because COVID-19 spread much faster (compared to previous outbreaks), affected the whole world (compared to limited geographies in other public health emergencies), and involved millions of people, pressuring Governments and healthcare systems to respond urgently. However, these theories still do not explain why more recent guidelines failed to reflect better methodological quality."

Some may argue that even if more robust methodology (consuming greater time and resources) had been employed, the resultant guidance may not have been different. This view is inappropriate for two reasons. Studies have shown that guidelines developed with inadequate methodology resulted in discrepant recommendations even for a limited set of interventions [22, 26] , often promoting therapies later conclusively proven to be ineffective [22, 27] and recommended not to be used. The ethical, clinical and economic consequences of such practices have also been highlighted [1] ."

            "text": "The authors wondered whether the AGREE-II tool could be somehow inadequate or inappropriate for COVID-19 guidelines, given the unique context and challenges. This question is relevant because guidance documents developed by prestigious guideline agencies also had low scores. In this context, it is worth noting that some items in the tool are open to interpretation, resulting in variable scoring. Further the tool itself lacks a provision for awarding an overall score. After completing the item-by-item assessment objectively, appraisers are expected to provide two subjective judgements viz. their assessment of the quality of the guideline, and whether they would recommend using the guideline [5] . Further, there is no absolute cut-off score that categorises guideline quality as 'high' or 'low', although higher scores reflect better quality, and vice versa. Despite this, some experts use cutoffs such as 60% as a minimum criterion to consider guidelines in their practice; and some classify 70% as the threshold for high(er) quality. On account of such challenges, some authors suggested alternate tools for critical appraisal of COVID-19 guidelines, with a focus on the implementation context [28, 29] , but these also have limitations and inconsistencies. What is the way forward? The authors believe that it is essential to improve guideline quality, with attention to methodological and other issues that can limit bias during Fig. 3 Correlation coefficient of the scores assigned by two appraisers for each of the 62 guidelines. The x-axis shows the guidelines, and the yaxis the correlation coefficient (rho) development. Some issues may be relatively easier to resolve than others. For example, almost all the included guidelines scored poorly in the domain of 'editorial independence', on account of poor reporting of funding sources and sponsors. For guidelines developed without vested interests, this should be relatively easy to rectify. Other issues are more complex, requiring methodological expertise to frame questions, conduct systematic reviews, appraise evidence, and use it to develop recommendations. Needless to mention, the process of evidence-based guideline development is resource intensive. Therefore, an alternate approach could be that guidelines need not be separately developed by each and every healthcare agency. Instead robust evidence-based guidelines developed by agencies recognized for producing trustworthy guidance, can be considered for implementation in local healthcare settings. The international collaborative 'COVID-19 Recommendations Map project' provides a detailed catalogue of methodologically-appraised guidelines and recommendations, through a single user-friendly portal [2, 30] . Instead of developing new local guidelines, stakeholders can enhance efficiency by accessing the available guideline recommendations and then deciding to adopt (without modifications), or adapt (with locally appropriate modifications) them."

The key aspect of guideline appraisal was conducted in a robust and transparent manner, minimizing several sources of bias. There are several limitations, notably searching through a limited number of databases, restricting to English language guidelines, excluding guidelines applicable to both adults and children, and curtailing the search till 30 April 2021. The nature of the AGREE-II tool, and its application by appraisers with varying levels of expertise and experience can also create observer biases."
