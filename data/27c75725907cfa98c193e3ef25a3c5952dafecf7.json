Fundamental work at the interface of engineering and medicine has allowed nanomedicines to deliver therapeutic small molecules and nucleic acids more efficiently. While nanomedicines are used in oncology for immunotherapy or to deliver combinations of cytotoxics, the clinical successes of gene silencing approaches like patisiran lipid complexes (Onpattro\u00ae) have paved the way for a variety of therapies beyond cancer. In parallel, the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the potential of mRNA vaccines to develop immunization strategies at unprecedented speed. To rationally design therapeutic and vaccines, chemists, materials scientists, and drug delivery experts need to better understand how nanotechnologies interact with the immune system. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the innate and adaptative immune systems and emphasizes the intricate mechanisms through which nanomedicines interact with these biological functions.",

Examples of ligands include various components of the wall of bacteria and fungi like lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and various \u03b2-glucans 12 Other important ligands of opsonic receptors are proteins of the complement system which will be described in more details below. Finally, apoptotic corpse receptors detect conformational changes in the phospholipid membrane of apoptotic cells.

The NOX2 enzyme consumes protons from the lumen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anions able to further degrade pathogens.

TLRs are a family of transmembrane proteins highly conserved between species. Until now, 10 human and 12 murine TLRs have been identified 18 . TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are found on the plasma membrane. In collaboration with coreceptors, they bind lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipopeptides, peptidoglycans, and bacterial flagella by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The binding of LPS to TLR4 and its coreceptor MD2 induces internalization 18 . Intracellular TLRs (3, 7, 8, and 9) are expressed in endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum, and can be recruited to the phagosome to sense its content. Examples of molecules that can be sensed by intracellular TLRs are single and double-stranded RNA, as well as CpG DNA motifs. These molecules are ligands for TLR7/8 (sRNA), TLR3 (dsRNA), and TLR9 (DNA). Activation of TLRs by their ligand induces J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cascades of signaling events which can translate into a type 1 interferon response or the production of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1)] 18 .

For nanoparticles with no steric protection (i.e., high intrinsic clearance), independent studies showed that augmenting the injected dose resulted in non-linear increase in blood exposure [42] [43] [44] [45] . This phenomenon was attributed to the limited quantity of opsonins available in the bloodstream 42 or to the saturation of liver Kupffer cells and other phagocytes [43] [44] [45] . Interestingly, for nanoparticles which have lower affinity for the MPS due to their steric protection (i.e., PEGylated), increasing the dose within a 100-fold range did not prolong circulation times 43, 44 .

Likewise, in a thorough and elegant study, Nikitin and colleagues 52 proposed that pre-dosing rodents with allogeneic anti-erythrocytes IgG2a could prolong the circulation times of various colloidal systems, including PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin. The forced clearance of red blood cells, 12 h before the injection of nanomedicines, resulted in increased circulation times compared to animals primed with vehicle. Although particles with very high clearance benefited the most from the phenomenon, forced clearance of erythrocytes appeared to induce a 1.6-fold increase in the blood exposure of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin 52 .

Using a variety of techniques, including intravital imaging, they showed that the clearance rates of gold nanoparticles significantly increased when a minimum threshold of 10 12 injected particles per mouse was reached. Doses above this number resulted in decreased J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f accumulation in macrophages and increased tumor deposition, for gold and silica nanoparticles, as well as PEGylated liposomes 53 . To further showcase the relevance of this threshold, one single administration of a fixed quantity of PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes (ca. 5\u00d710 12 particles, 2 mg/kg of doxorubicin) had significantly increased antitumor efficacy when delivered with a large quantity of empty particles (ca. 5\u00d710 13 empty particles). Time will tell if this threshold can translate to humans by allometric conversions, and whether the phenomenon, obtained with single dose administrations, holds true for multiple dose regimens used in the clinics.",

The C3a protein does not directly interact with the pathogen but is involved in recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages to the site of infection. The classical pathway involves the binding of C1q protein to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins found on the surface of pathogens (IgM or IgG). C1q also bind to lipid A, \u03b2-sheet amyloid fibrils, pentraxins, and apoptotic cells 61 . The lectin pathway differs from the classical pathway only in the initial stimuli responsible for the conversion of C4 into its bioactive fragments. Instead of relying on the presence of surface antibodies, the lectin pathway is initiated by lectin binding to mannose residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids, or by ficolins binding to N-acetylated surfaces.

Interestingly, they J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f showed that the adsorption of the protein clusterin (apolipoprotein J) on the surface of nanoparticles could inhibit the in vitro uptake in macrophages by >70% 79 . In our own hands, preincubation of PEGylated nanoparticles with clusterin before intravenous injection to healthy mice resulted in increased blood circulation times only for particles with very low PEG densities (<20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 ) 46 . In the same work, we also showed that nanoparticles with low steric protection were cleared much faster in transgenic mice which did not express apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein responsible for lipid trafficking in the blood. It is therefore possible that clusterin and other apolipoproteins, which interact physiologically with hydrophobic biological constituents, bind to the surface of nanoparticles with low PEG densities to somehow stabilize them.

While C57bl/6 mice exhibit a general susceptibility to type 1 polarization, the response of BALB/c mice is biased toward type 2. In a very interesting study, the teams of Bear and DeSimone 87 have compared the clearance of nanoparticles in type 1-and type 2-biased mouse strains. During the 2 h that followed the intravenous injection of cylindrical, negatively charged, 300-nm PEG-hydrogels, type 1-biased mice (C57bl/6 and B10D2) had at least a 4-fold higher blood exposure than their type 2 counterparts (BALB/c and DBA2) 87 . These differences were also noticeable for 30-nm quantum dots, but not for 6-\u03bcm microparticles. The authors ascribe these distinctions to a higher expression of mannan receptors on the surface of phagocytes from BALB/c mice, compared to C57bl/6 animals. It is unclear how this phenomenon translates to other materials. In this experiment, the clearances of the studied materials were relatively fast, as all had <25% of the initial signal remaining in the blood 2 h after injection 87 . Independently, we also compared the pharmacokinetics of 90-nm polymer nanoparticles with different PEG densities in BALB/c and C57bl/6 mice 46 . Over 6 h after intravenous injection, the blood exposure observed with nanoparticles with low steric protection (i.e., 15 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 ) was approximately 1.8-fold higher in C57bl/6, compared to BALB/c mice. Interestingly, these differences disappeared for nanoparticles with slower clearances 46 . Altogether, this suggests that differences J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between type 1/2-biased strains might be more important for nanoparticles which are quickly removed from the circulation than for longer-circulating systems.",

Three intravenous injections of these sophisticated nanovesicles to C57bl/6 mice bearing subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma, resulted in increased tumor levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12, and reduced amounts of IL-10, strongly supporting a shift toward a type 1 response 92 . In this metastatic-prone cancer model, treatment with nanovesicles was able to prevent cancer recurrences after surgical tumor ablation and significantly prolong survival. Interestingly, the nanovesicles were much less potent in a triple-negative breast cancer model (4T1 cells) implanted in BALB/c mice. To achieve comparable efficacy in these type 2 biased animals, encapsulation in nanovesicles of cyclic GMP-AMP, a strong ligand of the intracytoplasmic pattern receptor STING, was necessary 92 . During their journey, if dendritic cells sense sufficient danger signals from the internalized pathogen (e.g., activation of TLR by DAMPs), it will upregulate the costimulatory protein B7 involved in the activation of T cells. Free antigens from the extracellular fluid can also passively drain to lymphoid organs where they can be internalized and presented by residing dendritic cells or B cells 96 . Some evidence also exists that monocytes can enter tissues without differentiation, up-regulate expression of MHC class II molecules, take up antigens and deliver them to lymph ",

Seminal studies in the 1990s showed that steric J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f protection on the surface of liposomes31,32 and polymer nanoparticles33 decreased unwanted distribution to the liver and the spleen, and prompted enhanced blood circulation times in rodents. This spurred interest in studying the in vitro interactions of nanoparticles with monocytes 34,35 and macrophages 36 , and eventually their distribution in the organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in vivo. Walkey et al. 36 evaluated the uptake of gold nanoparticles with different poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) densities in cultures of reticulum cell sarcoma (J774A.1 cells, a cancerous cell line resembling macrophages). After 4h of incubation in vitro, they reached three conclusions: 1) the cellular uptake of nanoparticles with no/low PEGylation (<32 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 ) was higher than that of nanoparticles with denser steric protection, 2) the uptake of larger particles (60 and 90 nm in diameter) was more efficient than that of smaller colloids (15 and 30 nm), and 3) cellular uptake became independent of the presence of surface proteins as the density of PEG on nanoparticles increased. Looking at human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, Bisso and colleagues 37 similarly confirmed that in vitro internalization increased with larger diameters until ca. 200 nm, and that protein adsorption could increase or decrease uptake based on the nanoparticle characteristics. Interestingly, in other in vitro settings, incubation of neutrophils with gold nanorods 38 , cationic silica nanostructures 39 , inorganic calcium phosphate nanoparticles 40 , or cationic lipid nanoparticles 41 triggered the rapid degranulation of extracellular traps.

Upon contact with the surface of pathogens, these proteins are cleaved in sequence and their enzymatic functions are activated, triggering a self-amplifying cascade. The deposition of complement proteins on pathogens decorates them with signals that facilitate phagocytosis and send messages to cells of the adaptive immune system. These proteins are called opsonins. Fragments of the complement cascade which do not bind to the pathogen can also act as chemokines and trigger effects more systemically.The two key components of the complement cascade are the C3 and C5 proteins which are responsible for most of the biological effects of the cascade. These proteins are cleaved into smaller fragments (C3a/C3b and C5a/C5b) by three well-known activation mechanisms: the alternative, classical, and lectin-mediated pathways. Each activation route leads to the formation of distinct C3 and C5 convertases, molecular complexes responsible for the conversion of C3 and C5 into their activated fragments(Fig. 3A).",

Likewise, lipid nanoparticles encapsulating siRNA lose their gene silencing properties in vitro in the absence of ApoE, and in vivo in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice81 . Finally, we showed that, irrespective of PEG coverage, the circulation times of polymer nanoparticles in animals that did not express the receptor for low density lipoproteins (Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 ) were longer than those observed in wildtype animals46 . Further investigation might therefore consolidate a more definitive role for apolipoproteins in the biological fate of nanomedicines.Finally, two recent reports highlighted the possible importance of \"natural\" antibodies on the fate of nanomedicines82,83 . These antibodies are non-specific immunoglobulins which circulate in the blood in the absence of infection. In vitro incubation of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (LipoDox\u00ae), PEGylated liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde\u00ae), and carbohydrate coated iron oxide nanoparticles (FeraHeme\u00ae), resulted in decreased complement activation, when the plasma of healthy donors and breast cancer patients was depleted of antibodies by exposure to protein A 82 . Complement activation could be restored with the reintroduction of polyclonal IgGs, but not monoclonal (non-specific) trastuzumab.

T cells can only recognize peptides with a length of 10-30 amino acids94 .Therefore, APCs specialize in intracellularly processing danger signals and presenting representative segments on their surface via dedicated transmembrane proteins, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. , MHC molecules are highly polymorphic (i.e., large differences exist between individuals) and represent a unique and necessary footprint used by lymphocytes to discriminate between self and non-self.Two categories of MHC molecules exist: MHC class I molecules present what is inside the cytoplasm, and MHC class II what has been phagocytosed. In other words, class I provides surveillance against cellular distresses that are replicating in the cytoplasm (including pathogens), while class II molecules are used by phagocytes to display what they have internalized 95 . Because all nucleated cells can be infected, MHC class I molecules are ubiquitous. In contrast, mostly professional APCs present MHC class II molecules. For reasons inherent to their effector functions detailed below, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells recognize antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules, while CD4 + helper lymphocytes bind only peptides on MCH class II complexes (i.e., interact with APCs).Antigen presentation is implicated in three important immune functions: 1) the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells toward an antigen-specific response (APCs are mostly dendritic cells), 2) the T-dependent production of antibodies (APCs are B cells, in lymphoid organs), and 3) the response of effector T lymphocytes (APCs are mostly peripheral macrophages)85 . The first two functions exploit the mobility of antigens and immune cells through the lymphatic circulation to facilitate contacts between dendritic cells and lymphocytes(Fig. 4). Peripheral dendritic cells that have internalized a pathogen and sensed inflammatory signals, notably the presence of IFN-\u03b3, can migrate toward lymph nodes to present antigens to na\u00efve lymphocytes.The presence of chemokines, notably ligands of the receptor CCR7 expressed on dendritic cells and lymphocytes, coordinates the movement of both populations towards the lymph nodes6 .",

Costimulatory signals originate from the binding of lymphocyte receptors to proteins on primed APCs, notably the involvement of the receptors in the CD28 superfamily which act as stimulatory (CD28, ICOS) and inhibitory (PD-1, CTLA-4) immune checkpoints. Cytokines can originate from the lymphocyte itself (e.g., in an IL-2-dependent autocrine loop) or from surrounding cells (e.g., CD4 + cells help the expansion of CD8 + cells).",

The first step of the humoral response involves the binding of an antigen to a B cell receptor exhibiting the correct specificity 105 . This happens when free antigens diffuse to the follicle of the lymph nodes or when blood-borne pathogens reach the spleen. The mechanisms of B cell activation differ based on whether the antigen is a globular protein or a larger polyvalent pattern. After binding their specific B cell receptor, antigenic proteins are internalized by na\u00efve B cells and traditionally presented on MHC class II molecules. While these events are not enough J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to stimulate the production of antibodies, they induce phenotypic changes in the B cell's chemokine receptors and initiate its migration toward the T cell zone of the lymphoid tissue 105 . At this location, the activated B cell presents its surface antigen to a differentiated CD4 + T follicular lymphocytes sharing specificity for the same antigen. Prompted by the secreted cytokines and the activation of its own CD40 by the T cell's CD40L, the antigen-specific B cell proliferates, forming a germinal center in the follicle. There, under the influence of T helper lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells, B cells undergo a series of hypermutation and selection events which translate into the development of antibodies with very high affinity toward the antigen. Under continuous stimuli from CD40 and cytokines (notably IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6), B cells eventually adopt a plasma cell phenotype able to secrete antibodies.",

            "text": "used 80-nm protein nanoparticles derived from the papaya mosaic virus to trigger a polarizing IFN-\u03b1 response in tumor-bearing animals. Injected intratumorally, these nanoparticles act as TLR7 agonists and induce the production of interferon gamma inducible proteins-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and other inflammatory cytokines. The ensuing tumor infiltration of CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocytes translates into prolonged survival in a model of B16F10 melanoma 120 . Importantly, in the same model, the treatment with the nanoparticles synergized strongly with anti-PD1 antibodies. The authors ascribe this synergy to the increased capacity of their J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f nanoparticles to prime CD8 + T cells, which can freely exert their cytotoxic effect in the presence of checkpoint inhibitors.More recently, other systems have been proposed to potentiate the therapeutic inhibition of immune checkpoints and further mitigate the ability of cancer cells to stall cytotoxic lymphocytes. For example, nanomedicines exhibiting polyvalent PD-L1 surface ligands were shown to be have higher affinity and selectivity than free antibodies toward cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo121 . In parallel, targeted nanoparticles were also used to silence PD-L1 expression and significantly decrease tumor volume in a murine model of non-small cell lung cancer122 .Beyond implications of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, Oberli et al.123 described lipid nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA that were able to efficiently transfect phagocytes to express protein antigens. Their rationale was that proteins expressed in the cytoplasm of APCs could be presented to CD8 + cells and induce clonal expansion. In vivo screening of a small library of nanoparticles (composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, surfactants, and ionizable and PEGylated lipids) identified formulations which resulted in the prevalence of antigen-specific CD8 + lymphocytes123 . Using a mock reporter luciferase mRNA, they showed that subcutaneously injected lipid nanoparticles transfected ~5% of the dendritic cells in the draining lymph node, ~3% of the neutrophils and ~1% of the macrophages. mRNA encoding the tumor antigen TRP2, transfected using a formulation which contained the TLR-agonist LPS, resulted in prolonged survival in a B16F10 melanoma model123 . Similar strategies, combining mRNA to other TLR agonists, like the small molecule R848, have also been proposed[124].In clinical oncology, T cells can be transfected ex vivo with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to confer them specificity toward tumor cells, irrespective of their original receptor configuration 125 . Reinjection of autologous transfected CAR T cells to a patient results in large numbers of tumor-specific lymphocytes that can fight the cancer, without the need for antigen presentation and clonal expansion. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u00ae, Novartis) and Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta\u00ae, Kite/Gilead) are examples of CAR-T cell technologies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S.-FDA) which cost upward of 300,000 $ per patient. To palliate to the complex and costly process of transfecting autologous cells ex vivo, CD3-targeted polymer-based nanomedicines to transfect the CAR to T cells in vivo have been proposed 126 . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Intravenous injection of these antibody-coated nanomedicines containing mRNA resulted in efficient transcription in approximately 8% of the splenic T cells, 3% of macrophages and 2% dendritic cells. Expression was transient and lasted for approximately 7-10 days. Using the cancer specific 1928z CAR, the authors showed that weekly intravenous injections could significantly prolong survival of immunocompetent mice models of leukemia and solid tumor 126 .",

The preclinical development of such technologies often necessitates the use of immunocompromised models which do not fully embody what occurs in immunocompetent hosts. For this reason, interactions of nanomedicines with the immune systems are sometimes overlooked. Likewise, while the clinical successes (and failures) of nanomedicines might provide some understanding on how to develop drugs that will help patients the most, many of the commercialized products are highly cytotoxic. With such agents, deconvoluting the effects of the drug from those of the carrier remains difficult.
