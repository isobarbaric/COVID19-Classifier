The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and the World Health Organization (WHO) states that in 2020 over 2.3 million of Africa's people were suffering from acute food insecurity [1] . Eighty percent of food production in Africa relies on smallholder farmers who have little access to and/or cannot afford advanced farming technologies [2] . Many factors can exacerbate the vulnerability of people to food insecurity. These include but are not limited to violent insurgencies and counterinsurgencies leading to displacement and livelihood disruptions, limited state presence, and competition over access and use of agricultural land and natural resources [3] . Extremes in climate variability due to climate change and degraded resources attributed to overuse and abuse of the land are also stressors that make sufficient production difficult to achieve [3, 4] ."

The progress made in recent years regarding the UN SDGs has either halted or regressed worldwide [5, 6] . In Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restraint measures are driving countries toward an economic and social crisis where not only health care but all spheres of life are affected, including food security. Most African countries rely heavily on local commercial and subsistence agriculture production for food security. Despite this, even before the pandemic, many regions and countries of Africa were food insecure. The SOFI report identifies an increase of 3% in the number of hungry people in Africa; in a period of only one year, from 2019 to 2020 (21% of the population), the increase was the sharpest in Western Africa [1] ."

The restrictive measures put in place to reduce the risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus have increased the food insecurity of many individuals [11] . Given that women have such a prominent role to play in agriculture and food security, it is possible (likely even) that they have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic in terms of food security. For example, and as documented in the latest report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021, the gender gap in the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity has increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, as women were 10% more likely to be moderately or severely food insecure than men in 2020 as compared to 6% in 2019 [1] . It has been reported that, even prior to the pandemic, women faced higher levels of food insecurity than men [1] . Women often are burdened with responsibilities linked to unpaid work (e.g., providing care), or in food system-related roles [12, 13] ."

Furthermore, few articles address food security and how it affects other issues that in turn affect women (e.g., pregnancy, mentalhealth, and well-being). We wanted to extract as much information as possible about the issues related to gender disparity linked to food security in this context using both scientific literature (using a PRISMA protocol) and grey literature (government and humanitarian group reports) to better understand the current view of the situation and especially identify the knowledge gaps. This research project assesses the impact of the pandemic and the measures implemented on food security and on gender relationships within communities within the pillars of food security (availability, access, utilization, and stability) in rural Burkina Faso and Senegal. Therefore, we expected that results from this review contribute to this research project to inform policy makers and humanitarian providers about how pandemics and various types of restrictions might affect food security to draw lessons for future pandemics."

Folayan et al. reported mixed results when interviewing 4439 Nigerians (53% of whom were women and 80.9% of whom had tertiary education) [25] . Overall, women and men reported similar financial losses (when no other variables were considered-with men reporting slightly higher at 58% compared to 55% for women). Food security was similar between men and women, with only 1% more women reporting being food insecure than men (21% vs. 20%). Overall, the odds of males being more food insecure were found to be lower than females; however, the authors admitted that gender was reported but not investigated to its fullest extent. Additionally, respondents who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their daily life were mainly those with a primary school education. A separate gender analysis within this sub-sample was not conducted."

However, these statistics must be interpreted carefully, as only 7/26 of those interviewed were women. The authors go on to suggest that this may have been due to women having higher workloads (e.g., care economy) due to restrictions and the inability to attend markets. It is also worth noting that individuals interviewed were mainly university staff, employed, and living in an urban setting, which does not necessarily give an accurate representation of the situation, as surveys would not have represented more vulnerable populations such as rural subsistence farmers, women-headed households or individuals that are not highly educated. Iddi et al. reported that 12% of Ghanaians surveyed through an online questionnaire about stress levels linked to well-being felt stressed about the possibility of getting COVID-19, thus causing food insecurity [21] . The study group was mainly composed of young people (56% under 34, 86% under 44, and 44% having no children), 79% lived in urban Ghana, 98.7% possessed a post-secondary education level, and 72% were employed by the government. Males and females' feelings in this group were found to be quite similar. A more inclusive interview process (e.g., all ages, all occupations, inclusive of rural environments) would present a clearer picture as to the current situation. Furthermore, HSRC echoed a similar sentiment regarding the lack of disaggregated data being a problem in South African studies [28] . Thus, disaggregation of any data that reports on women and men is an urgent need for future research."

Although better than using data that are not disaggregated, looking at the gender issue at the level of head of household does not necessarily present a complete understanding of the situation that women face. For example, Ibukun and Adebayo conducted interviews to evaluate the state of food security at the household level during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria [26] . Gender was not specifically analyzed, and results indicated that, education level income, and wealth status determined whether households reported being food insecure-of which more than half reported being severely food insecure. Moreover, the authors report that 10% of households in the North are female headed as opposed to 25% of the households in the South. The difference is significant and demonstrates that regional discrepancies may occur, and research should be conducted and reported accordingly so as not over-generalize. Furthermore, such studies completely omit the male and female relationships and how decisions are made within a household. This concern underlines the need for on the ground analysis of the conditions and the importance of interviewing women and men separately, as conditions can differ greatly."

Their simulations indicated a higher impact on female poverty (increase by 5% from 46% to 51% in the severe scenario). Some of the model inputs relied on 2012 statistical data (e.g., poverty rates), and it wasn't clear whether they accounted for any sort of government COVID-19 and food security assistance that could have been applied. It must also be understood that the model itself is still just predictive and not necessarily a reflection of what is happening. In addition, the simulation looks at the impact on household poverty and does not provide direct information about food security within households."

Their conclusions were based mainly on predictions from past crises and evidence of gender disparity in other contexts (some from the 1990s). The complexity of highlighting gendered differences due to the social-construct of the concept of \"foodworry\" should be noted. Maula recommended that more work needed to be done towards collecting, reporting, and disseminating better data surrounding gender impacts, as the data were poor [15] . It is therefore difficult to confirm that gender inequalities continue to happen at the alarming rate with what is currently being reported in the literature, (even though many would agree that it is) or if COVID-19 is aggravating current situations."

Liverpool-Tasie et al. conducted surveys focused mainly on hidden components of food supply chains and how they were negatively affected during initial pandemic stages [26] . While only two points were given concerning impacts to women, they were related to loss of employment and therefore a critical component of food security (e.g., Nigerian fish businesses went from supporting 20% to 2% female employment between February-pre-pandemic and April; however, males were also impacted, but to a lesser extent, with total man workers dropping to 20% from 50% during same period). In South Africa, interviews (n = 40; women = 22, men = 18) provided insight into women vs. men farmers [29] . While in general there were no formal reports about differences in gender, the study found that only women farmers lost access to land (n = 2), and five out of six farmers who had to halt production completely were women (two women farmers voluntarily stopped work to stay at home to care for family). In both articles, results suggest that women are losing their jobs more readily than men. Future research should examine the reasons and how jobs are lost i.e., whether women are leaving of their own free will or whether they are laid off in greater proportion than men."

However, Tom and Chipenda [30] did not offer actual evidence of such occurrences and a few documents seemed to base their predictions on global statistics [17, 32, 37] , which did not necessarily provide an actual picture of the current conditions in Africa. Breakfast's and Nomarwayi's predictions of increased violence linked to food security and the pandemic suggested that this was more likely to occur in rural settings, where police presence was typically lower, indicating a need to target future research in such settings [14] . Overall, the number of predictive documents that reported increases in female and male inequalities underlined the urgent need for research focusing on on-the-ground, real-time evidence collection in African nations, particularly in rural regions. Understanding how women deal with food insecurity, pandemics, and power struggles can also define how these factors impact their health and capacity to continue providing, especially for their children."

The main issue with this article was that while women versus men were considered in the initial baseline survey, data were combined in the follow-up survey, making it impossible to determine who was most affected. While Saalim et al. presented a very structured PRISMA media review that focused somewhat on women and pandemic food security specifically, the authors made many predictions based on information gathered from the previous Ebola epidemic [19] . Much of the media reviewed used terms such as \"at-risk\" or \"serious concerns about\" when referring to the safety and security of women. Children might have been the most vulnerable in terms of food security and violence (assumingly, both girls and boys were reported together). They only mentioned one article that reported gender-based violence both before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., in Liberia). However, upon closer investigation, they did not provide clear details on comparisons between pre-and post-COVID numbers. Their study showed that the media, although mainly anecdotal in nature, reported a great deal of information concerning current gender-based disparities. Caution should be taken when using media materials, as there could be bias. A media-review should be used with a critical eye on the sources of the materials."

            "text": "There are several limitations that apply to this study, including the decision to completely disregard media reports. In some cases, media reports may be the only way to access information that applies to some of the more remote areas of Africa, especially during the pandemic. The lack of evidence-based information from remote rural areas and/or vulnerable populations does not mean that these individuals are not experiencing insecurities and inequalities, only that they have not yet been reported on reliability or formally recognized. Saalim et al., for example, used such a media review [19] . They identified women and children as the most discussed vulnerable groups in media during the pandemic and food insecurity and poverty as cross-cutting issues for the vulnerable populations. While their data may suggest self-reporting for occurrences of gender-based violence and other health issues, bias may exist in such analysis and may not explain the root causes of the issues."

            "text": "This review shows that a clear disparity exists in the number of available statistics in terms of how many studies and reports disseminate clear and consistent gender information. Obtaining data that include separation by sex as well as actual methodological reporting is crucial to better understand the situation on the ground and push for the implementation of gender-sensitive policy changes. Since PRISMA protocols were used to search the English literature, it may also be beneficial to conduct searches for French language publications, including more local journals, given that many West African countries are mainly French speaking. During any pandemic or other disasters, there is a tendency to rapidly acquire data to demonstrate impacts without having a detailed understanding of the conditions on the ground. Unfortunately, most measures, policies and even aid are based on such rapid assessments that do not consider gender issues, power relations between men and women, and social classes, among many aspects of a crisis such as a pandemic."

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic in Africa has exposed the need to better understand what is happening on-the-ground in terms of the food insecurity and other inequalities faced by women. There is a need to explore not just how we think individuals may be affected but how they are being effectively affected, and how to create better reporting options and support for occurrences of gender-based violence and the like. There is an urgent need to better understand the needs of individuals, particularly women (e.g., farmers, caregivers, traders) and to apply gender specific variables/questions to all research that seeks to address socially negative, pandemic-related effects on their health, wellbeing, and conditions due to food insecurity. When investigating concepts such as food security, there is an additional need to address all four pillars (i.e., availability, access, utilization, and stability), as each pillar is intimately connected to the other."

            "text": "This study investigates what is currently known about the association between the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the restrictive measures and the effects on food security, and gender disparities as they exist in Africa. Results demonstrated that disparities exist in the reporting of data regarding rural versus urban and women versus men. It was further found that a large portion of the literature focuses on predictions surrounding what may happen during the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which predicted women would be subjected to increased inequality. No literature was found about the impact of the pandemic-related stress on power relationships between genders. Less literature investigated actual evidence that supported what was being predicted; however, reporting disparities between gender within communities and households and a general lack of on-the-ground, well-designed, evidence-based research suggests that we are missing the full picture. The study also highlighted a lack of evidence and studies conducted in West Africa, and furthermore an absence of studies on gender impact during COVID-19 in Burkina Faso and Senegal, especially on women, their food insecurity, and their health. Further studies that focus on collecting disaggregated data from rural settings that also consider media reports prior to designing research questions is recommended."
