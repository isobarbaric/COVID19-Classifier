        "text":"Summary of data publicly reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Date: 5\/3\/23 [Note: We will be updating this report every month, depending on the continued availability of the data.] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 6 months of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age. See AAP policy. In this report, drawing on data posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 5.3.23, the AAP reports progress in vaccinating US children, including the 50 States and District of Columbia. The report covers the vaccine data available for children 6 months-4 years, and the longer-term data for children 5-11 years and for children 12-17 years of age. See link below to download the full AAP report. Note: Individual state web sites may have additional or more recent information. Children Ages 6 Months-4 Years: As of May 3, 2023, the CDC recorded: 2.2 million US children ages 6 months-4 years have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 13% of 6 months-4 year-olds This past week about 7,000 received their first vaccine dose. About 14.9 million children 6 months-4 year-olds had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 3% to 45% receiving their first dose. Children Ages 5-11 Years: 11.2 million US children ages 5-11 have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 39% of 5-11 year-olds 9.2 million US children ages 5-11 completed the 2-dose vaccination series Representing 32% of 5-11 year-olds About 17.4 million children 5-11 had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. The past week about 6,000 received their first vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 17% to 83% receiving their first dose. Children Ages 12-17 Years: 17.9 million US children and adolescents ages 12- 17 have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 68% of 12-17 year-olds 15.3 million of US children and adolescents ages 12- 17 completed the 2-dose vaccination series Representing 59% of 12-17 year-olds About 8.3 million children 12-17 had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. The past week about 5,000 received their first vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 40% to 100% receiving their first dose. Portion of US Children who have received vaccination: Across the total of US children 6 mos to 17 years, approximately 56%, 40.5 million children, have not received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

        "text":"On May 11, 2023, the United States ended the Public Health Emergency (PHE) that was declared over three years ago to organize government resources and establish policies needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. After three years of weekly reporting on the number of child COVID-19 cases in the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association (CHA) will be sunsetting the weekly state COVID-19 reports. Origins of the Report The report was created in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic to measure how COVID-19 was affecting children in the United States. The CDC had begun providing national data on COVID-19 cases, but timely, regular data on pediatric cases were not available. Thus, we turned to data provided by states and territories and began to collect information from their web sites for the most current pediatric data. By compiling this information we could track the number of child cases weekly, as well as provide publicly reported case numbers for children at the state level. Changes in Data Available Over the past three years this report has provided a unique and valued resource to understand the impact of COVID-19 on children, and to understand trends in volume of cases and geography as COVID-19 variants emerged. The data in the report have always been limited by variations in how states categorized and reported COVID-19 cases. Beginning in 2022, as home COVID-19 tests became widely available, an increasing portion of COVID-19 cases were likely unreported. In 2023 an increasing number of states reduced the frequency of reporting and updating cases. As the end of the PHE approached, these trends intensified, and many states announced their posts were ending. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 with indicators that are available. However, given the decreasing access and reliability of data on the number of child COVID-19 infections, this weekly report was sunset May 11, 2023. We will continue disease surveillance as we do for other infectious diseases. Final Summary As of May 11, 2023, nearly 15.6 million children were reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports. Over the past three years, the highest number of child cases reported in a week was over 1.1 million for the week ending January 20, 2022. Since the pandemic began, children represented 17.9% of total cumulated cases. The portion of reported cases that were children ranged from a low of 2.0% the week ending April 16, 2020 to a high of 28.9% the week ending September 9, 2021 (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). On May 11, an additional 6,848 child COVID-19 cases were reported. Over the past 6 months, weekly reported child cases have plateaued at an average of about 24,000 cases, while in the past month the average reported weekly cases have dropped further to about 9,000. These trends parallel the pattern and decline that has been reported for adults. It remains important to address the long-lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth. The AAP compiled a snapshot of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and provides resources to help pediatricians support them.

Let's Get Started Transcript Transcript Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today, we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia in Chicago. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer also in Chicago. Andrea, welcome back. Garcia: Hi, Todd. Thanks for having me. Unger: So hard to believe, but it is officially November. And I guess it's a bit of an understatement to say that we're not as far along as we thought we would at getting people vaccinated and protected for a potential winter surge. Andrea, what's going on with that? Garcia: Yeah, so there was a survey of nearly 15,000 people that was presented to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week. And that survey showed that just over 7% of adults and just about 2% of children have received that updated COVID vaccine. And that was as of October 14. So the uptake has been slow, even in populations that we know are at most risk for severe illness from COVID. Only one in five people aged 75 and older have been vaccinated along with about 15% of those aged 65 to 74. Unger: All right, I guess numbers that low really beg for understanding. Andrea, do you think this is just a matter of people being over it, not aware of the vaccine? What gives? Garcia: Well, that could certainly be part of it, but it's likely that people still don't understand the risk of COVID, especially certain populations. According to the CDC, we are still seeing more than 1,200 people dying of COVID each week. That number is still higher than we would like it to be. About 16,000 people were hospitalized with COVID in that week ending October 14. And that's a much smaller number compared to the nearly 23,000 hospitalizations at the same time last year and the more than 44,000 in 2021. It's still not 0, not even close. And there's differences between populations. Hospitalizations among adults aged 75 and older are two to three times higher than for those in that 65- to 74-year-old age group. And we also continue to see those disparities in who's getting sick. So hospitalization rates are the highest among native American, Alaska Natives and Black Americans. And those observed disparities could be the result of multiple factors. I think one of them is the fact that less than 1% of native American and Alaska Natives and 7.6% of Black Americans have received the vaccine as of October 14. Unger: So just to reiterate statistic you mentioned there, 1,200 people dying from COVID a week. Maybe that just\u2014we've lost our sense of perspective about just how many people that is certainly relative to the other numbers that maybe people are used to hearing. It's a lot of people. So important to get the vaccine. Andrea, we talked a few weeks ago about some of the issues with the rollout. Does the bumpy rollout that we were experiencing have something to do with the low numbers? Garcia: Well, that certainly hasn't helped the situation. And we've talked previously that most people should be able to get the vaccine at no cost either through private insurance, through Medicare or Medicaid. Government programs have made the vaccines available for free to children and also to adults who are underinsured or uninsured. And that's at least through the end of December 31, 2024. Still, many people are reporting trouble getting the vaccines at pharmacies, being charged fees, or even mistakenly being turned away. And as we discussed a couple of weeks ago, at some of the pharmacies, the demand has outstripped supply, which has led to canceled appointments. And we know doctor's offices are also frustrated. They're ordering fewer quantities. So aren't prioritized for distribution. We are hearing that that is starting to improve. So hopefully, we'll begin to see those vaccination rates go up. Membership Moves Medicine\u2122 Free access to JAMA Network\u2122 and CME Save hundreds on insurance Fight for physicians and patient rights Join the AMA Today Unger: So, Andrea, I guess what we're saying is there is an access issue here. Is that the only problem that we're really seeing? Garcia: No, absolutely not. I think that's only part of the problem. And if we look at that same CDC survey, about 38% of adults said they would not choose the vaccine for themselves and about the same percentage are saying that they would not have their children immunized. So it doesn't really matter how accessible and widely available these vaccines are if people aren't willing to get them. I think another part of the problem may be confusion. Although the recommendations are pretty straightforward, we know that they're not necessarily being heard by the public. And as you know, this is the first year we have three respiratory virus vaccines available at the same time, which may be adding to the confusion. People likely have questions about things like optimal timing and whether or not the vaccines can be co-administered. This is where physicians can really play a key role by talking to their patients, answering their questions, letting them know when and where to get the shots that they're eligible for and that they need. Unger: So we have this background or backdrop of very slow vaccine uptake. And at the same time, we're seeing a new variant emerging. Is this something that we should be concerned about? Garcia: Yeah, this didn't make many headlines, but there is a new COVID variant to keep an eye on. It's called HV.1. And according to CDC data that came out last Friday, it has already replaced EG.5 as the country's most dominant variant. HV.1 now makes up about 25% of COVID cases, which is up from about 1% at the beginning of August. EG.5 is now at 22% of cases. That's down from 24% at the start of October. Both of these are descendants of the XBB variant. And as a reminder, the updated COVID vaccines target XBB.1.5. Experts say that these new vaccines should offer cross protection against the currently dominant strains. Unger: So even more reason to get vaccinated. Andrea, what do we know about this new variant? Does it cause different symptoms, more severe illness? Garcia: Well, the only thing we really know right now is this could be slightly more adept than EG.5 at spreading among people or infecting those with prior immunity to COVID. So far, it's not causing alarm. It's pretty much in line with how we expect the virus to evolve. Most scientists don't seem too concerned about versions of Omicron that look similar to those that we've seen before, which is the case here. Unger: Good. Seems like a piece of good news. And we need that. So we have some more good news, believe it or not, this time about long COVID. Andrea, tell us more about that. Garcia: So it's actually both good and bad news. But let's start with the good news first. There was a small study on long COVID that was published last week in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. It found no evidence of ongoing infection or brain damage among patients with persistent symptoms. This is going to be a relief to many long COVID patients, who often report those symptoms of fatigue and memory loss or impaired concentration and brain fog. According to the study findings, there were no significant differences in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid for immune activation or brain injury biomarkers compared with those in the control group. So this suggests that long COVID is more likely a consequence of events that occurred during that acute phase of the illness rather than an ongoing viral infection or persistent inflammation of the central nervous system. Unger: You mentioned some bad news possibly. What are we hearing there? Garcia: Well, there was a second study that was published in BMC Infectious Diseases. And researchers in Norway examined registry data to assess the prevalence and risk factors for long COVID at least three months after an infection. So they looked at more than 50,000 people who tested positive for COVID between February of 2020 and 2021. They were compared with more than 485,000 uninfected matched control participants. They found that COVID survivors had higher rates of most studied symptoms compared to the controls. And the greatest risk was shortness of breath, fatigue, memory loss and headache. Researchers specifically found the risk of fatigue or shortness of breath more than doubled 3 to 12 months after COVID compared to the control group. Researchers also noted that the likelihood for memory disturbance; other respiratory symptoms; pain in the abdomen, chest or musculoskeletal system; and headache were significantly higher in that COVID group. So we may not see that lasting brain damage. But some people can certainly expect to experience certain symptoms months or even up to a year after infection. Unger: All right. And this long COVID is an area of great interest. We're going to continue to keep a close eye on that and update you further. We talked a lot about the new COVID shots and the challenges with distribution over the past few weeks. Some of this is because the commercialization of those vaccines. The same thing is now happening with COVID treatments. Andrea, what does that mean? Garcia: Yeah, so starting today, November 1, certain COVID treatments are no longer going to be purchased and distributed by the government. And they will end up being pretty expensive. Pfizer is pricing their five-day course of Paxlovid at around $1,400. That doesn't mean that's what people are going to pay out of pocket. Many Americans will still be able to access those pills at no cost. For now, that's because millions of taxpayer funded courses of the pills are going to remain in pharmacies, hospitals and doctors' offices across the country. When those supplies do run out, that's when people with private insurance will start to notice co-pays for those treatments. Under a new agreement between Pfizer and the federal government, people on Medicaid, Medicare and those without medical insurance will not pay any out-of-pocket costs for the treatment. And that's through the end of next year. Pfizer is also going to offer co-pay assistance for the treatment through 2028. The VA, the DOD and the Indian Health Service will also be able to access Paxlovid that the government has on hand. Unger: Andrea, is Paxlovid the only treatment that's affected by this commercialization issue? Garcia: No, it's not. The less commonly used COVID-19 treatment Lagevrio, which is manufactured by Merck, also hits the commercial market. At the time of this filming, Merck hasn't confirmed the list price for that. They did say, however, that they will make that treatment free to patients who without assistance could not otherwise afford the product. Unger: All right, well, thank you for that update. Andrea, as always, great to have you here for our weekly check-in. That wraps up today's episode.

Let's Get Started Transcript Transcript Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia in Chicago. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer also in Chicago. Welcome back, Andrea. Garcia: Hi, Todd. It's good to see you. Thanks for having me. Unger: Well, we're about to head into the big Thanksgiving holiday week. And it's one of the busiest travel periods all year. The CDC announced that it will be conducting additional monitoring at all major airports. Andrea, tell us more about that and what it's going to mean for travelers. Garcia: Yeah. So this additional monitoring is being conducted through the CDC's Travel-based Genomic Surveillance Program or TGS and that began during the pandemic. And it acted really as an early warning system to detect new COVID variants. That program really consists of a couple of different approaches. One of them is voluntary nasal sampling of arriving international travelers. There's airport iterator drain sampling. And then airplane wastewater sampling. According to the CDC, that TGS program has been remarkably effective at detecting many variants entering the U.S. up to six weeks before they have even officially been reported nationwide. Earlier this month the agency said that they're expanding a pilot program and that's going to include testing for flu, RSV and other respiratory viruses. Unger: Good work, CDC. Andrea, tell us more about how the pilot expansion is going to work. Garcia: Yeah. So we know that there are seven international airports that participate in the COVID surveillance efforts. Under the pilot, TGS is going to be expanding to test for more than 30 bacteria antimicrobial targets and viruses. And that's specific to four airports, so Boston, San Francisco, Washington Dulles and JFK in New York. The pilot is going to last for several months. And it's time to come ahead of the winter months when we know those respiratory viruses are circulating more heavily. CDC says that this expanded program could potentially help prevent tens of thousands of infections. Unger: Wow. That is very smart. Andrea, you said expanded testing and monitoring. Let's talk about how we go beyond that. We know that vaccines are also another big tool here in the armament. What does the CDC say about getting vaccinated ahead of the holidays? Garcia: Yeah. So in an interview with CBS News I think it was about a week ago Dr. Mandy Cohen, who we know is the director of the CDC, said that best window to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family before any gathering is about two weeks out, because we know it takes 1 to 2 weeks for COVID and flu vaccines to boost immunity. However, given where we are now, we know we're just days away from Thanksgiving. It's important to keep in mind that it's never too late to get vaccinated and protected against these respiratory viruses, which we know can cause severe illness and even death in some populations. As we've talked about before, the CDC expects to see flu, COVID and RSV circulating at the same time this season. We know that high vaccination levels can help lessen the severity and impact of these diseases. And this year we're lucky because we do have vaccines available for all three viruses for the first time ever. Unfortunately, we still have a ways to go to reach those high vaccination levels. Unger: Andrea, last time we talked we hadn't seen a significant rise in RSV, COVID or the flu yet. Is that still the case? Garcia: Well, according to the flu review put out by CDC most recently we know that flu activity is now increasing in most parts of the country. That's most noticeable in South Central, the Southwest and the West Coast regions. We also know that RSV and COVID cases are increasing in some jurisdictions. We have a new COVID variant called HV.1 that we do need to keep an eye on. It's just been a few short weeks and HV.1 has become the variant responsible for most COVID cases here in the U.S. As a reminder, CDC recommends that everyone six months and older get that updated COVID vaccine and this year's seasonal flu vaccine. And a common question is can they be administered together? And the answer to that is absolutely, yes they can. Unger: Andrea, one of the things we've talked about over the past few weeks is just overall low vaccination rates. And one of the reasons that underlies that has been kind of a rocky rollout that we experienced with the updated COVID shot and supply shortages that we ran into with the RSV vaccine. Any updates there in terms of how that's been going? Garcia: Yeah. There has been some good news for parents who we know have been trying to protect their babies against RSV. Last week, we heard the CDC announce the release of more than 77,000 additional doses of Beyfortus, that's that long-acting monoclonal antibody that is designed to protect infants from severe RSV disease. These additional doses are going to be distributed immediately to physicians and hospitals through both the VFC program and commercial channels. That should help improve availability of the shot for eligible infants, particularly those at risk of severe illness. CDC and FDA have said that they're going to continue to be in close contact with the manufacturers to help ensure the availability of additional doses through the end of this year and into early 2024 to try and meet that demand. CDC is asking physicians to prioritize those doses for those infants that we know are at highest risk during this period of constrained supply. That includes young infants up to six months and American Indian Alaska native infants among other groups. And at the same time, CDC and FDA are also encouraging physicians to use that RSV maternal vaccine, which is not facing those same supply challenges as the monoclonal antibody, that can help protect babies against RSV before they're born. Unger: All right. Well, staying on the topic of children and vaccines, a new report came out that provided insight on overall vaccination rates among children. Andrea, what are the key takeaways there? Garcia: Well, Todd, it's not particularly good news. According to a recent report from the CDC, the childhood vaccine exemption rate, that's the number of kids who are not getting their routine childhood vaccines, has reached an all-time high. That report specifically looked at kindergartners whose parents or caregivers have opted them out of vaccines. And CDC found that as a national average 3% of children entering kindergarten in the 2022-2023 school year were granted a vaccine exemption from their state. This is the highest vaccine exemption report ever reported in the U.S. 41 states saw a rise in exemption in 10 states including Arizona, Hawaii, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, that exemption rate was over 5%. And Idaho had the highest exemption rate with more than 12% of children entering kindergarten with a vaccine exemption in 2022. CDC indicates that exemption rates over 5% increase that risk for outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases like measles, mumps, and polio. Unger: These are really concerning statistics. Andrea, do we have any idea why this is happening? Membership Moves Medicine\u2122 Free access to JAMA Network\u2122 and CME Save hundreds on insurance Fight for physicians and patient rights Join the AMA Today Garcia: Well, this specific report did not go into the reasons for that increase in exemptions. Given this, it's not really clear whether they reflect a true increase in opposition to the vaccine, vaccine hesitancy or if parents are asking for non-medical exemptions because of barriers to vaccination or if there are even other factors involved. I think CDC is trying to get a better understanding of the reasons at play so it can use that information to inform policy that will help increase vaccination rates and stop a reoccurrence of diseases that we know are preventable. Unger: Speaking of preventable diseases, syphilis has been making headlines. However, it's not in the way that you would think. It's affecting newborns. Andrea, what's going on there? Garcia: There has been an alarming increase in syphilis infections in newborns. When a pregnant person with syphilis passes the infection to the baby during pregnancy, we know that's called congenital syphilis. According to a CDC report, more than 3,700 babies were born with syphilis in the U.S. in 2022. That's a 32% increase from the year before and a 1,000% increase from 2012. Syphilis, if left untreated in a pregnant person, can have devastating consequences for the baby. Babies born with congenital syphilis in 2022, about 300 of them died or were stillborn. In addition to stillbirth, we know that untreated syphilis can damage the baby's organs and bones and harm vision and hearing, which we know can lead to lifelong health problems. Unger: Andrea, any idea why this is happening now? Garcia: We know that each congenital syphilis case is considered a never event. It's a tragic outcome that should never happen because it's nearly always preventable if it's caught and treated in time. According to the CDC, newborn syphilis occurs when people who are pregnant don't receive that timely testing and treatment during pregnancy. It's a single course of penicillin given at least a month before the end of pregnancy and that nearly always prevents infected mothers from passing the bacteria to their babies. But the CDC findings show that almost 90% of congenital syphilis cases in 2022 could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment. More than 50% were among people who tested positive for syphilis during pregnancy, but they didn't receive that timely inadequate treatment. 40% were among mothers who received no prenatal care and that has to change. Unger: Andrea, what can physicians do about this particular problem? Garcia: So there's a need to really focus on reaching those at-risk populations and getting them screened and tested. CDC is really encouraging treatment following a rapid syphilis test during pregnancy if there's a chance that patient might not be available for follow up care. They're also recommending rapid syphilis testing and treatment in places like emergency departments and syringe service programs, prisons and jails, as well as maternal and child health programs. There's an education piece here that needs to focus on prevention. We need to address syphilis before pregnancy in counties where we know there are high syphilis rates. And we need to proactively screen sexually active women and their partners who have risk factors for syphilis. CDC called this a failure of the U.S. health system. And I know that we are seeing too many people who are not being tested and treated for syphilis. Unger: And that's definitely something we'll be hearing more about.

        "text":"AMA News Wire What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 oral antivirals The federally declared COVID-19 public health emergency has ended, but the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still circulating. Previously, there was a rise in cases due to the Omicron variant followed by its subvariants XBB.1.5, EG.5 and FL.1.5.1, among others. And while there is an ongoing need for people to stay up to date on their COVID-19 i vaccine, two antiviral oral treatments are available. Yet patient confusion remains about who is eligible and how these treatments work. Advancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA Two oral antivirals\u2014Paxlovid and molnupiravir\u2014are available for treatment of COVID-19. Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Paxlovid\u2014a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir\u2014is the first oral antiviral pill to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe illness, including hospitalization or death. It is also authorized for use in children 12 or older who are at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. About 250,000 courses of Paxlovid are being administered per week. Molnupiravir is also authorized for adult outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines. In this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious diseases physician, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills. There are two options There are two options \u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known as Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d \u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she said, noting that when this antiviral \u201centers the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d \u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently approved for use in all adult patients and authorized in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d They prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death \u201cPaxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d \u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d The pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure \u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d \u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, these two medications really only cover those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said. Severe COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care \u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d \u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d \u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Paxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets As a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tablets of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d \u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is. \u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Molnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules \u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said. Some side effects are expected Some side effects are expected \u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness,\u201d she said.

Consult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant \u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d \u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d Breastfeeding is also not recommended during treatment with molnupiravir and for four days after the final dose. \u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d Not everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills \u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d \u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d Get vaccinated against COVID-19 Get vaccinated against COVID-19 \u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. \u2026 Prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d Those who are 6 months or older are eligible to receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine and should get it as soon as possible. This is a universal recommendation, similar to the flu vaccine. For those 5 or older, a single dose of the updated vaccine is all they need, regardless of previous vaccination status and even if they\u2019ve never had any previous COVID-19 vaccinations. This is because anyone 5 or older likely has some COVID-19 immunity, either through previous vaccination, infection or both. Meanwhile, those who are immunocompromised need a three-dose prime and at least one updated shot. They can also get additional doses if their physician recommends it. Younger children\u20146 months to 4 years old\u2014may need a multi-dose regimen, with two doses of Moderna, or three doses of Pfizer. The updated vaccine may be an addition to or part of that initial series. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe,\u201d Dr. Choi said. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines \u2026 will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die.\u201d \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated \u2026 as completely as possible against COVID-19,\u201d she said.

        "text":"New research in this week\u2019s MMWR finds that most nursing home residents haven\u2019t received an updated COVID-19 vaccine or the new RSV vaccine. This year, for the first time, vaccines are available to protect older adults in the United States against all three fall\/winter respiratory illnesses: flu, COVID-19 and RSV. Older Americans who are not vaccinated are at greater risk of serious illness. Leading up to this virus season, and throughout the fall, CDC has worked with other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and health care partners to address vaccine access issues and encourage uptake. CDC was a key participant in the Long Term Care Facility Summit on October 18, 2023, which was co-hosted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy. In addition to other activities, CDC regularly: Monitors all reports and data about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. Convenes bi-weekly calls with long-term care partners to address challenges\/develop solutions. Works to improveequitable access to vaccines by connecting manufacturers with long-term care pharmacies to prioritize vaccine distribution for the Bridge Access Program. Distributes a weekly newsletter with respiratory virus resources and information specific to long-term care providers. (e.g., toolkits, FAQs, clinical resources, vaccine confidence resources) Supports the education of partners through participation in speaking engagements and webinars. Engages with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) toidentify solutions to address feedback from long-term care partners around billing and reimbursement challenges which have been a barrier to vaccine administration. As a result, CMS issued a letter to plans and pharmacy benefit managers to outline the concerns and provide guidance on ways to improve practices. Health care providers can continue to do their part by offering recommended vaccinations to residents. Nursing homes are encouraged to collaborate with state, local and federal public health, and long-term care pharmacy partners to address barriers contributing to low vaccination coverage. Vaccination is a key way to prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death from flu, COVID-19 and RSV.",

        "text":"While federal officials declared the public health emergency over in 2023, the pandemic response yielded important lessons and best practices related to child welfare financing that can be carried forward into non-pandemic times. The State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020 Child Welfare Financing Survey, conducted by Child Trends with support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Casey Family Programs, provided some insight into this topic.[1] In particular, the survey asked states about how the pandemic had impacted child welfare agency expenditures and whether it had contributed to any new or creative uses of funding. National findings are available in the SFY 2020 Child Welfare Financing Survey report. For this brief\u2014and to more fully explore the financing-related lessons that emerged during this time of great disruption\u2014Child Trends identified and interviewed child welfare agency staff from five states that completed the SFY 2020 Child Welfare Financing Survey to discuss, in more detail, how they navigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child welfare financing.

        "text":"Post-Covid Changes in Employer-Provided Benefits and Flexibilities That Shape Child Care Options and Needs Among Latino Parents With Low Incomes In response to the pandemic, many industries provided more employer-sponsored benefits and adopted more flexible policies; if they remain in place, such offerings might better support parents\u2019 child care options and needs moving forward. We analyzed data from the 2020 and 2021 Business Response Survey (BRS) to explore how the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes responded to the pandemic in terms of these benefits and flexibilities. The BRS is a new survey initiated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2020 to gather information about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected business operations. More generally, the BRS seeks to provide timely information about how the economy responds to various events. Our analyses look at changes in benefits and flexibilities across industries in three domains: the availability of sick leave and paid time off, the flexibility of schedules, and the availability of remote work. Figures 3-6 show the percentage of business establishments within each industry that increased or started new practices across these domains. In interpreting these results, note that the publicly available data do not provide baseline or pre-pandemic information. When possible, we provide baseline numbers from other sources to help contextualize the BRS findings. Additionally, we show the national average included in all BRS tables to benchmark the results and to provide a comparison point for how the industries and occupations that employ Latino parents with low incomes deviate from this average. Importantly, the specific industries included in the publicly available BRS estimates are not consistent across years and outcomes examined. For example, some BRS tables combine the health care and social assistance industries while others show them separately. Similarly, administrative and support; waste management; and agriculture, forestry, and fishing are not shown in all BRS tables. Thus, the industries included in Figures 3-6 are not always consistent. Sick leave and paid time off Figure 3 shows the percentage of business establishments within each industry that started providing sick leave during the pandemic, or that increased the amount of sick leave provided. We know from prior research that, pre-pandemic, the majority of private sector workers had access to sick leave (73%),31 although this percentage varies among the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes. For example, at the higher end, 84 percent of workers in the education and health services industries and 79 percent of those in manufacturing and transportation had sick leave in 2019. At the lower end, only 45 percent of employees in the food services industry had pre-pandemic sick leave. For the other industries in which Latino parents with low incomes work\u2014such as construction, administrative and support and waste management, other services, and retail trade\u2014this percentage ranged from 58 to 65 percent, respectively.32 As shown in Figure 3, the majority of businesses in the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes did not start or increase sick leave in response to the pandemic. However, of those that did, social assistance (20%), manufacturing (19%), transportation and warehousing (17%), health care (17%), and retail trade (15%) industry businesses did so at a rate higher than the national average (of 14%). Post-pandemic, nearly one quarter (23%) of Latino fathers with low incomes and roughly 40 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes work across these industries. With the exception of retail trade, these are also the industries that, pre-pandemic, were above the national average in the percentage of workers with access to sick leave. However, most Latino parents with low incomes are employed in the remaining industries, which were below the national average in the likelihood of starting or expanding sick leave in response to COVID. Figure 3: Most businesses within the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes did not start or increase sick leave during the pandemic Distribution of the percent of business establishments that started or increased sick leave, by the top industries employing Latino parents with low incomes, 2020 Figure 4 shows the percentage of private businesses by industry that started providing additional paid leave for dependent care (either at all or in addition to what was already in place) because of the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, in 2017-2018, 66 percent of workers had access to paid leave of any kind (e.g., personal, medical, family care, etc.), although this percentage was lower for workers in construction and service occupations (36% and 43%, respectively).33 Very few businesses across the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes initiated paid leave for dependent care due to the pandemic (see Figure 4). Approximately 10 percent of businesses in the manufacturing and social assistance and health care industries started additional paid leave for dependent care, which is higher than the national average (6.5%). About one quarter (26%) of Latina mothers with low incomes and 9.5 percent of Latino fathers with low incomes work in these industries. However, less than 6 percent of businesses across the other industries\u2014those that employ roughly half (51%) of Latino fathers with low incomes and 30 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes\u2014started this benefit, including only 4 percent of businesses in the accommodation and food services industry. Figure 4: Most businesses within the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes did not start providing additional paid leave for dependent care as a result of the pandemic Distribution of the percent of business establishments that offered additional paid leave for dependent care, by the top industries employing Latino parents with low incomes, 2021 Work schedule flexibility The COVID-19 pandemic led some businesses across industries to adopt new policies around work arrangements and schedules that may allow for more employee flexibility or control\u2014via job sharing, voluntary reduction in work hours, compressed or alternative work schedules, and flexible or staggered work hours. This type of flexibility was generally quite rare pre-pandemic. Data show that roughly 11 percent of private sector workers had a flexible schedule pre-pandemic, and that this offering was generally lowest in many of the industries that employ the majority of Latino parents with low incomes (e.g., administrative and waste management services, retail, construction, and accommodation and food services).34 As shown in Figure 5, the most adopted schedule flexibility was the implementation of flexible or staggered work hours, although this varied across industries. Nearly one third (31%) of businesses in the educational services industry started this practice, compared to only 16 percent of businesses in the construction and transportation-warehousing industries. Post-pandemic, roughly 40 percent of Latino fathers work across these industries. For businesses in the other industries that employ many Latino parents with low incomes, the adoption of flexible work arrangements or staggered work hours was similar to the national average (24.6%). Voluntary reductions in work hours and compressed\/alternative work schedules were the next most frequent schedule flexibilities adopted in response to the pandemic. These changes were adopted by 13 to 20 percent of businesses in the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes\u2014somewhat higher than the national average. However, the transportation-warehousing and construction industries\u2014employing over 40 percent of Latino fathers with low incomes and nearly 6 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes\u2014were below the national average in adopting this flexibility. Job sharing was a very rare practice across the industries that employ most Latino parents with low incomes\u2014just 1 to 5 percent of businesses in these industries started this practice. At the high end, 5 percent of businesses in the accommodation-food services industry implemented job sharing, which is higher than the national average of 2.6 percent. Notably, post-pandemic, this industry employs 9 percent of Latino fathers with low incomes and 17 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes. Figure 5: The adoption of flexible or staggered work hours was the most common schedule flexibility adopted as a result of the pandemic Distribution of the percent of business establishments that implemented flexible schedules, by the top industries employing Latino parents with low incomes, 2021 Telework Prior to the pandemic, nearly 70 percent of Latino fathers and almost half of Latina mothers with low incomes worked in industries that did not offer telework options (<30% of businesses in these industries offered telework compared to nearly half of businesses across the private sector more broadly)\u2014including accommodation and food services; agriculture, forestry, and fishing; retail trade; construction; and other services (BRS data not shown). As shown in Figure 6, most businesses across these industries did not offer new telework or expand their telework opportunities as a result of the pandemic. Nationally, 30 percent of businesses started or increased telework arrangements during the pandemic. Businesses in educational services, social assistance, manufacturing, and health care were above the national average in providing this flexibility, ranging from 60 percent of businesses in educational services to 30 percent of businesses in administrative and support and waste management services. These industries employ roughly 10 percent of Latino fathers and 30 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes. However, only 4 percent of businesses in the accommodation and food services industry started or increased telework. This industry employs 9 percent of Latino fathers and 12 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes. Figure 6: Most businesses in the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes did not start to offer telework or change telework arrangements Distribution of the percent of business establishments that started or increased telework arrangements, by the top industries employing Latino parents with low incomes, 2021 Conclusion Our analysis presents the first national portrait of the industries and occupations that employ Latino parents with low incomes and how these shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the majority of Latino parents with low incomes work in certain industries and occupations such as construction, accommodation and food services, and personal care and service, among others. This occupational segregation has been highlighted by other research and largely reflects persistent discrimination in hiring and other barriers that limit employment opportunities.4,6 Our analysis shows that the industry and occupational distribution of Latino parents with low incomes remains largely unchanged from pre- to post-pandemic for mothers and fathers, with one notable exception: A higher percentage of Latina mothers with low incomes work in the transportation and warehousing industry post-pandemic, relative to pre-pandemic. In general, Latino parents with low incomes work in industries and occupations with limited employer-provided benefits (e.g., the ability to take sick or dependent care leave) and in which parents usually work nonstandard hours, have little control over their schedules, experience schedule instability, and are unable to work remotely.8,19,27 While the pandemic influenced some businesses across these industries to offer increased benefits and work schedule flexibilities, our analysis shows that, post-pandemic, the majority of businesses within the industries employing many Latino parents with low incomes have either not started offering benefits or have not increased benefits that allow parents to better meet family and child care needs. For example, the industries that were least likely to start additional paid leave for dependent care during the pandemic employ nearly one third of Latina mothers and almost half of Latino fathers with low incomes. Additionally, nearly 70 percent of Latino fathers and 40 percent of Latina mothers with low incomes work in industries that were below the national average in starting or increasing telework during the pandemic. To the extent that the broader business community increased or started job flexibilities, these changes\u2014with few exceptions\u2014did not take place in the industries employing most Latino parents with low incomes. This finding suggests that, following the pandemic, Latino workers with low incomes may have even less access to employer-provided benefits and flexibilities relative to other workers than they did pre-pandemic. Notably, Latino parents with low incomes born outside the United States are overrepresented in jobs that lack these flexibilities and benefits, including construction, accommodation and food services, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations. Implications for child care These findings have important implications for parents\u2019 ability to find child care, particularly in the formal sector,8 and for their ability to respond to child care disruptions. Pre-pandemic, parents with low incomes already experienced frequent child care disruptions, including lack of availability or closures of child care arrangements, lack of affordability, or safety concerns.13 These disruptions have been exacerbated post-pandemic.13,20 After the onset of the pandemic, 30 to 40 percent of Latino households with children under age 12 reported child care disruptions. In Spring and Summer 2022\u2014well into the recovery and roll-out of vaccinations\u201417 percent of Latino households reported child care disruptions.20 These disruptions are costly: Pre-pandemic estimates found that Latino parents with low incomes lost one week of wages per quarter, on average, due to child care disruptions.13 Indeed, other research indicates that many parents coped with child care disruptions by altering their work arrangements, missing work, cutting hours, or leaving the labor market. Post-pandemic, roughly one third of Latino parents responded to child care disruptions by cutting hours. Compared to all parents, Latino parents were less likely to use paid leave and to supervise their children while working as a way to cope with these disruptions.20 Some research, consistent with our own work, finds that Latino parents work in industries and occupations that do not provide leave or the option to telework. In supplementary analyses not shown in this brief, we found that, post-pandemic, roughly 9 percent of employed Latina mothers with low incomes who were absent from their job in the prior week missed work due to child care disruptions; pre-pandemic, this figure was 4 percent. Implications for social service programs supporting child care needs Our findings also have important implications for social services programs designed to support the child care needs of working parents with low incomes, including the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which provides subsidies to states, territories, and tribes to administer child care programs for workers with low incomes. Research shows that parents who work in jobs with little flexibility and unstable, unpredictable, and nonstandard work schedules\u2014such as the jobs held by many Latino parents with low incomes\u2014are less likely to use child care subsidies than others.35 This occurs, in part, because these parents rely less on center-based care and more on family-based care or other informal care arrangements that offer flexibility and are available during nonstandard hours,35 even though attendance at center-based care is not required to receive subsidies.24,35,36 Additionally, features like unstable hours and forced part-time work, which may limit eligibility for child care subsidies, are more prevalent in the industries and occupations that employ Latino parents with low incomes.b,24,25,27,37 These limitations may even be exacerbated in the post-pandemic era if increased flexibilities\u2014such as the voluntary work reductions adopted in the industries employing one third of Latino fathers and two thirds of Latina mothers with low incomes post-pandemic\u2014put parents below state minimum work hour requirements. As a result of the pandemic, many state CCDF programs adapted their requirements (e.g., minimum hours and income limits). Future research should examine how these changes\u2014coupled with changes in the job characteristics of Latino parents during the pandemic\u2014shaped Latino parents\u2019 subsidy eligibility and use. The lack of benefits and flexibilities disproportionately experienced by Latino parents with low incomes might also negatively affect their participation and success in other important social service programs, including workforce training and education programs. Evidence from participants in the Health Profession Opportunity Grants (HPOG) Program\u2014which offers training in health care professions for TANF recipients and other adults with low incomes\u2014found that participants who are working parents or caregivers struggle to find child care options that are flexible, open during nontraditional hours, and allow them to fulfill their work and educational obligations. Findings from HPOG and other programs underscore that success for working parents and caregivers in this and similar training programs likely depends on having adequate support systems from family and friends and, importantly, on flexibility at work and school\u2014which many occupations do not offer.38,39 As we show here, this lack of flexibility is particularly acute for Latino parents with low incomes. Ultimately, while the pandemic did not substantially change the industry and occupational distribution of Latino parents with low incomes\u2014or result in increased flexibility to support parents\u2019 child care needs\u2014it did negatively affect the child care industry, exacerbating child care disruptions.20 This is particularly problematic for Latino parents with low incomes, who continue to be concentrated in industries and occupations with limited flexibility to respond to family care needs and disruptions in their children\u2019s care. Future research should do more to understand how the post-pandemic work environment affects the child care choices available to Latino parents with incomes, their occupational choices, and how these may change in the future. Evidence suggests that employment of Latino parents with low incomes is, with some exceptions, expected to grow most across some of the industries and occupations that offer little flexibility.40 More research should also consider heterogeneity within the industries that employ Latino parents with low incomes\u2014for example, it could consider the ways in which job quality, job characteristics, and the ability to cope with child care disruptions differ among workers who are unionized and those who are not. Finally, future research should focus on understanding how the job quality characteristics described in this study affect human service programs\u2019 ability to serve parents with low incomes and what policy changes may be necessary to better achieve this goal.

The terms are used to reflect the U.S. Census definition to include individuals having origins in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, as well as other \u201cHispanic, Latino or Spanish\u201d origins. b Because many parents with low incomes who have unstable or unpredictable work schedules often face varying hours and forced part-time work\u2014where parents work fewer hours than desired\u2014their eligibility for subsidies may depend on state guidelines regarding income limits and minimum work hours.25,37 For example, in 2020, nearly 40 percent of states had minimum work (or education) hour requirements for child care subsidies that ranged from a monthly average of 15 to 30 hours per week, although policies vary widely by subgroups (i.e., single parents, TANF recipients, foster parents) and across states.

        "text":"This article first appeared on our sister site, Contemporary OB\/GYN. Neonatal outcomes do not significantly differ between newborns born to unvaccinated women compared to women who received inactivated vaccines for COVID-19 before conception, according to a recent study published in JAMA Network Open. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 868,000 new cases of COVID-19 and over 3700 deaths between June 26 and July 23, 2023, making COVID-19 a continuous global health concern. COVID-19 vaccination offered protection among multiple populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including pregnant women. COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with morbidity and mortality in mothers and infants. As COVID-19 vaccination does not increase morbidity risk, the WHO recommends pregnant women received vaccination. However, most information about vaccines is based on mRNA vaccines, with little data available on inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. To evaluate the impact of inactivated vaccination within 3 months before conception on neonatal outcomes, investigators conducted a cohort study including all singleton live births from March 1 to June 30, 2022, at Tianjin Central Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Newborns in the vaccinated group were born from mothers who received their initial COVID-19 dose prior to conception, while those whose mothers did not receive vaccination before or during pregnancy were in the unvaccinated group. Data on COVID-19 infection was obtained through questionnaires, and gestational age was determined by ultrasound or last menstrual period. What You Need to Know The study found that neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, did not significantly differ between newborns born to women who received inactivated COVID-19 vaccines within 3 months before conception and those born to unvaccinated women. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a significant number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths between June 26 and July 23, 2023, emphasizing the continued global health concern posed by COVID-19. The study suggests that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, and the investigators recommend that women planning for pregnancy receive the COVID-19 vaccination. This recommendation is particularly relevant for inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. Exclusion criteria included missing consent, non-singleton birth, invalid or incomplete COVID-19 vaccine information, untargeted COVID-19 vaccine receipt, incomplete clinical information, COVID-19 vaccination more than 3 months before conception, and any dose of vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy. Primary outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Secondary outcomes included very preterm birth, late preterm birth, low birth weight, very low birth weight, neonatal bacterial infection, and mortality. There were 856 neonates included in the analysis, 369 of which were in the vaccinated group. Higher education levels and rates of unplanned pregnancy were observed in the vaccination group, as well as decreased rates of assisted reproductive technology use. Rates of preterm birth, SGA, and NICU admission did not differ between the vaccinated and unvaccinated group, even after adjusting for maternal characteristics. Very preterm birth, late preterm birth, low birth weight, very low birth weight, and neonatal bacterial infection also did not differ between groups. No cases of mortality were observed. These results indicated COVID-19 vaccination does not impact newborn outcomes. Investigators recommended women preparing for pregnancy receive COVID-19 vaccination.

        "text":"At the end of November, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) granted approval for ARCT-154, a self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine for initial vaccination and booster for adults 18 years and older. Arcturus Therapeutics is in an exclusive partnership with CSL Seqirus, CSL\u2019s vaccine subsidiary, and is manufacturing the ARCT-154 vaccine. The companies are developing novel mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and influenza.1 \"Today's approval marks a historic and exciting milestone as the first sa-mRNA vaccine in the world to be registered, and supports CSL's promise to protect global public health,\" Jonathan Edelman, MD, senior vice president, Vaccines Innovation Unit, CSL, said in a statement. \"We are committed to working with health authorities around the world to ensure this important vaccine technology will be available to people at risk for COVID-19.\" 1 The approval is based on positive clinical data from several studies, which included an ongoing 16,000 subject efficacy study performed in Vietnam as well as study from booster trial. In previous reporting from Contagion, topline data from the booster study demonstrated higher immunogenicity results and a favorable safety profile compared to a standard mRNA COVID-19 vaccine comparator. What You Need to Know In November, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) granted approval for ARCT-154, a self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine. Arcturus Therapeutics is collaborating with CSL Seqirus, CSL\u2019s vaccine subsidiary, to develop novel mRNA vaccines targeting COVID-19 and influenza. ARCT-154 belongs to the self-amplifying mRNA platform, which differs from traditional mRNA vaccines. T The booster study was a phase 1\/2 randomized, observer-blind trial conducted in both the US and Singapore, and included 36 adult participants who were previously immunized with approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as a primary series. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive one booster dose on day 1 of either the ARCT-021, ARCT-154, or ARCT-165 vaccines, all of which encode the SARS-CoV-2 full-length S glycoprotein of, respectively, the ancestral strain in native conformation, a prefusion-stabilized B1 variant including the D614G mutation, or the Beta variant. Immunogenicity was assessed as neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain, and a panel of variants measured by pseudoviral microneutralization assay on Days 1, 15, 29, 91, 181, 271, and 366. All 3 vaccines induced robust neutralizing immune response against the D614G variant at Day 29 with geometric mean fold rises (GMFR) from pre-booster levels of 20.0, 36.7 and 23.5 after ARCT-021, ARCT-154, and ARCT-165, respectively. ARCT-154, a leading candidate, induced a broad, cross-neutralizing immune response, which persisted up to one-year post-booster with no further boosting. Similar trends were observed for other variants including Beta, Delta, Omicron BA1, Omicron BA2, and Omicron BA4\/5. Additional exploratory testing confirmed cross-neutralization against emergent BQ11 and XBB15 Omicron sub-lineages with GMFRs of 12.8 and 3.4, respectively, at Day 29 post-booster. The sa-mRNA Platform The Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform protects against infectious diseases by instructing cells in the body to make a specific protein, stimulating the immune response, and leaving a blueprint to recognize and fight future infection. However, sa-mRNA makes copies of the mRNA which generates the production of more protein compared to an equivalent amount of mRNA in a vaccine. The companies report the technology has the potential to create more potent cellular immune responses and increase duration of protection, while using considerably lower doses of mRNA.1 Reference 1.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.contagionlive.com\/view\/identifying-post-viral-syndromes-such-as-long-covid",
        "text":"Long COVID continues to be an ongoing public health issue. \u201cLong COVID includes a wide range of ongoing respiratory, neurologic, cardiovascular, and other symptoms that can last for weeks, months, or years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estimates of long COVID incidence among nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19 range from 7.5% to 41%.\"1 Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) offers some similarities in that its etiology remains unknown, and it cannot be officially diagnosed or cured. One commonality for everyone dealing with CFS is the overwhelming fatigue that can impact them by significantly reducing people\u2019s quality of life. And without a diagnosis and a specific set of treatment(s), this open-ended condition, could linger for months or even years. Right now, Long COVID can often present like chronic fatigue syndrome, and there is a wide array of symptoms. Fatigue is certainly one of the lingering symptoms for Long COVID and there is no definitive testing to diagnose this post-viral syndrome. This presents problems for both people afflicted by it, but also clinicians as they are challenged to treat symptoms but not able to pinpoint the diagnosis. However, one company, Virax Biolabs, is looking to help in diagnosing Long COVID with its proprietary T-cell testing platform, ViraxImmune, with the intention of providing an immunology profiling platform. \u201cWe're actually focusing now on Long COVID, post viral syndromes, chronic fatigue, and T cell exhaustion. We\u2019ve provided some T cell diagnostic indications along these lines that allow us \u2014at an early stage\u2014identify patients who are suffering from any of these diseases,\u201d said Virax Biolabs Chief Scientific Officer Tomasz George, PhD. \u201cWe can provide this test that's quite easy to use. It's an established technique that's present in most laboratories. And it will allow us to detect associated chronic inflammation and T cell exhaustion associated with these post viral syndromes.\u201d George explains they are looking for cytokines and markers of inflammation to detect Long COVID. \u201cWe take a blood sample from them, we treat that blood sample with a sequence of peptides, that's associated with the COVID virus. And what this does is it can activate memory T cells in the blood that then go on to release cytokines that are specific to the infection with long COVID, we can then detect these cytokines and signs of inflammation.\u201d ViraxImmune is a proprietary T cell testing platform to determine whether an individual will be able to mount a robust response to an infection. T cell tests are more informative than antibody and antigen testing as T cells provide long-term immunity to pathogenic threats. With a better understanding of immune status and consultation of a physician, patients will be equipped with information to make personalized proactive and protective decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all against viral threats, according to the company. Contagion spoke to George recently and he explained further how they apply their testing platform to identify Long COVID, and the company\u2019s long-term plan to use its technology in identifying post-viral syndromes.

        "title":"What Is the Difference Between the Flu and COVID-19?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/story\/what-is-the-difference-between-influenza-and-covid-19",
        "text":"While every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies. Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions. Courtesy, NIAID Influenza and the coronavirus disease COVID-19 appear to be very similar. After all, both are respiratory diseases, and they are transmitted via contact with infectious respiratory droplets. Beyond that, however, they differ in important ways. What are some of these differences, and why do they matter? Contagiousness One difference between COVID-19 and influenza is that the former appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. A person infected with influenza spreads the disease to another 1.3 individuals. For COVID-19, an infected person spreads illness to another 2 to 2.5 persons. Severity of illness and death rate COVID-19 also appears to cause more severe illness more frequently than seasonal influenza. Part of this difference may be attributed to the fact that COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus, against which humans have no immunity. By contrast, many people have at least some degree of immunity against seasonal influenza, enough to prevent hospitalization and complications in most instances. Along those same lines, COVID-19 is deadlier than influenza. The mortality rate of influenza is roughly 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be about 1.4-4.5 percent, with risk of death being significantly higher for older persons than for younger individuals. Seasonal nature Seasonal influenza, as its name suggests, tends to come and go as the weather changes. Influenza viruses circulate year-round, but the number of new influenza cases generally increases in the cooler months and tapers off in the warmer months of the year. This does not mean that cold weather causes the flu; rather, cool weather, by bringing people indoors, along with other changes, is a contributing factor. It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away. COVID-19 is a new disease, and there are many millions of people worldwide who have not yet been exposed. This deep reserve of potential hosts could fuel sustained transmission through summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Many factors, however, determine seasonality of diseases, and more time is needed before conclusions can be drawn about whether COVID-19 is a seasonal illness. Causative agent A more obvious difference between influenza and COVID-19 is in their causative agents. Influenza viruses belong to a virus family known as Orthomyxoviridae. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which is classified in the family Coronaviridae. Both families consist of RNA viruses, but they differ particularly with regard to the protein layer that encapsulates the RNA. More specifically, influenza viruses express two surface antigens (foreign proteins)\u2014hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)\u2014which trigger an immune response. The exact form of these antigens changes every now and then, resulting in the periodic emergence of new, more virulent influenza viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic. The surface of SARS-CoV-2 does not have these antigens. Rather, similar to other types of coronaviruses, its outer surface is studded with glycoprotein spikes, which give such viruses a crownlike, or coronal, appearance. Spike glycoproteins are responsible for triggering the immune response, and they carry out the critical function of enabling the coronavirus particle to enter cells, where it then replicates.",

This is the conclusion reached by an international research team analysing the situation during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. The cleaner air has ensured that less soot has been deposited on the glaciers, resulting in 0.5 to 1.5 mm less snow melting per day. The rapid retreat of glaciers and the loss of snow cover already pose a threat to the sustainable water supply of billions of people in Asia who live in the catchment areas of rivers such as the Indus, Ganges and Yangtze. If emissions of air pollutants such as soot could be reduced to at least the level of the lockdowns, snowmelt could be reduced by up to half. A switch to clean energy supplies and lower-emission modes of transport would therefore bring significant benefits for sustainable water supplies, agriculture and ecosystems in large parts of Asia, the researchers write in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/news-releases\/1029787",
        "text":"Through an international collaboration, scientists at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital leveraged data science, pharmacology and structural information to conduct an atomic-level investigation into how each amino acid in the receptor that binds adrenaline contributes to receptor activity in the presence of this natural ligand. They discovered precisely which amino acids control the key pharmacological properties of the ligand. The adrenaline receptor studied is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, and this family is the target of one-third of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Thus, understanding how GPCRs respond to natural or therapeutic ligands is critical for developing new therapies with precise effects on receptor activity. The work was published today in Science. To understand how a watch works, one might take it apart, piece by piece, and study the role played by each component in its timekeeping function. Similarly, in a protein such as a GPCR, each amino acid might play a different role in how the protein responds to an external signal. Researchers at St. Jude, in collaboration with scientists from Stanford University, the University of Montreal, the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cambridge University, investigated the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) by substituting one amino acid at a time to understand the contribution of each amino acid in this receptor to mediate a signaling response. \u201cScientists learn how genes contribute to cell function by disrupting them one at a time. We asked, \u2018Why don\u2019t we take this one level deeper? Let\u2019s understand how every amino acid contributes to the functioning of a receptor by mutating them, one amino acid at a time,\u2019\u201d said co-corresponding author M. Madan Babu, PhD, from St. Jude\u2019s Department of Structural Biology, Center of Excellence for Data-Driven Discovery director and the George J. Pedersen Endowed Chair in Biological Data Science. \u201cThrough evolution, every amino acid in the receptor has been sculpted in some way or another to ensure that it binds the natural ligand, in this case adrenaline, and elicits the appropriate physiological response.\u201d Finding function in the form GPCRs are proteins that span the cell\u2019s membrane and connect the outside of the cell to its internal environment by transmitting external signals to the inside of the cell. In the case of the \u03b22AR, adrenaline binds to the GPCR on the part outside of the cell, inducing a response inside the cell. When a ligand binds, it causes changes in the shape of the receptor, especially in the intracellular region of the receptor where a G protein binds. The binding sites for the ligand and the G protein are on opposite sides of the protein but connect through a complex network of amino acid contacts that span the entire protein. Conformational (shape) changes within the GPCR activate the G protein to trigger a downstream signaling response within the cell. Through effects on multiple tissues and GPCRs, including the \u03b22AR, adrenaline can trigger the fight-or-flight response, such as during an adrenaline surge. To understand the role of each amino acid in a GPCR, Franziska Heydenreich, PhD, now of the Philipps University of Marburg, the lead and co-corresponding author of this project, mutated each of the 412 amino acids in the \u03b22AR. She then evaluated each mutant\u2019s response to the ligand adrenaline and determined the classical pharmacological properties of efficacy and potency. Efficacy measures the maximum response a ligand can elicit, and potency measures the amount of ligand required to elicit half of the maximum response. The aim was to reveal, on an atomic scale, how each amino acid contributes to these pharmacological properties. \u201cSurprisingly, only about 80 of the more than 400 amino acids contributed to these pharmacological properties. Of these pharmacologically relevant amino acids, only one-third were located within regions where the ligand or G protein bound to the receptor,\u201d Heydenreich said. \u201cIt was fascinating to observe that there are some amino acids that control efficacy, some that control potency and then there are others that affect both,\u201d Babu said. \u201cIt means if you want to make a more potent or efficacious drug, you now know there are specific residues that the new ligand needs to influence.\u201d The researchers also noted that the individual contribution of each residue to efficacy and potency was not equal, implying even more opportunities for fine-tuning drug responses while designing new therapeutic ligands. \u201cEfficacy and potency have been measured for numerous ligand-receptor signaling systems for several decades. Now we can understand how specific amino acids in a protein\u2019s sequence can influence these pharmacological properties,\u201d Babu explained. \u201cA fascinating aspect of the results is that potency and efficacy can be regulated independently of each other through distinct mechanisms. This provides a basis for understanding how genetic variation influences drug responses among individuals,\u201d Michel Bouvier, PhD, co-corresponding author from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and General Director of the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer of the University of Montreal added. A beautiful network Prior research illustrated the structure of both the active and inactive states of the \u03b22AR. Building on this knowledge, the researchers embarked on a new investigation. They explored whether the two-thirds of pharmacologically relevant amino acids previously demonstrated to be not involved in ligand or G-protein binding might play a role in the transition between the active and inactive states of the receptor. \u201cWe systematically started looking at every residue contact unique to the active state,\u201d Heydenreich said, \u201cto understand whether all the amino acids that make an active-state contact are important.\u201d The researchers developed a data science framework to integrate pharmacological and structural data systematically and revealed the first comprehensive picture of GPCR signaling. \u201cWhen we mapped the pharmacological data onto the structure, they formed a beautiful network,\u201d said Babu. \u201cIt provided new insights into the allosteric network linking the ligand binding pocket to the G protein binding site that governs efficacy and potency.\u201d Added Brian Kobilka, co-corresponding author and the 2012 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry from Stanford University School of Medicine. By understanding GPCR signaling at the atomic level, the researchers are optimistic that they can begin probing even deeper \u2014 to see the transient sub-states between the active and inactive conformations and to explore the conformational landscape of proteins. \u201cWe now know which mutants to go after, those that only affect efficacy, potency or both,\u201d Heydenreich said. \u201cNow, we can perform molecular dynamics calculations and single-molecule experiments on those mutants to reveal the exact mechanisms by which the allosteric network influences efficacy and potency to mediate a signaling response. This is a direction we are pursuing through a St. Jude Research Collaborative on GPCRs that includes PIs from several institutions.\u201d Babu explained. Apart from these \u201cdriver\u201d residues that are involved in mediating active state-specific contacts and affect pharmacology when mutated, Babu and his colleagues intend to probe other key findings revealed by this work. They aim to study \u201cpassenger\u201d amino acids that, despite making contacts in the active state, do not affect efficacy or potency when mutated. They are also interested in \u201cmodulator\u201d residues that don\u2019t mediate active state-specific contacts but alter pharmacology when mutated. Their data science approach, integrating structural information and pharmacological measurements, isn\u2019t limited to the \u03b22AR. It can be extended to any GPCR to enhance our understanding of the mechanics governing this crucial class of drug targets.

Notify me Receive an email when it is updated You just subscribed to receive the final version of the article Background: Among the advantaged population with clinical cure of chronic hepatitis B, chronic inactive hepatitis B virus carriers (IHCs) and nucleoside analog-experienced patients have similar serological manifestations. This study established non-interferon-treated groups as control to compare the efficacy of Peg-IFN\u03b1-2b in achieving clinical cure between IHCs and NA-experienced patients. Method: Total 270 patients were enrolled in this observational study, the IHCs cohort had 55 patients received Peg-IFN\u03b1-2b (Peg-IFN group), and the other 70 patients did not receive any antiviral treatment (Untreated group). Patients treated with NAs were divided into two groups, one group (70 patients) receiving NAs add-on Peg-IFN\u03b1-2b therapy regimen (NAs add-on Peg-IFN group), and another group (75 patients) continuous NAs monotherapy (NAs group). The primary endpoints are the HBsAg clearance and HBsAg seroconversion at 48 weeks and 72 weeks. Results: At 48 weeks, 65.5% (36\/55) and 52.9% (37\/70) patients got HBsAg clearance in Peg-IFN group and NAs add-on Peg-IFN group (P=0.156). HBsAg seroconversion was achieved 47.3% (26\/55) of Peg-IFN group, 34.3% (24\/70) of NAs add-on Peg-IFN group (P=0.141). Followed up to 72 weeks, 36 patients in the Peg-IFN group achieved HBsAg loss (65.5%, 36\/55), and 33 patients in the NAs addon Peg-IFN group achieved HBsAg clearance (47.1%, 33\/70) which significantly higher than the Peg-IFN group (P=0.041). And the HBsAg seroconversion rates in the Peg-IFN group and NAs addon Peg-IFN group at 72 weeks were 45.5% (25\/55) and 32.9% (23\/70) (P=0.151). No patient got HBsAg clearance or seroconversion in NAs group and untreated group. Furthermore, the receiver operator curve showed baseline HBsAg <72IU\/ml, the declination of HBsAg more than 80% and 98% from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks provide good prediction for HBsAg clearance. Meanwhile, 77% patients with baseline HBsAg<100IU\/ml got clinical cure at 48 weeks. Conclusion: Peg-IFN\u03b1-2b results in high rate of HBsAg clearance and seroconversion both in IHCs and NA-experienced patients, especially, for those patients who HBsAg below 100 IU\/ml.",

        "text":"We report the scintillation spectra of Ar\/CF 4 mixtures in the range 210\u2013800 nm, obtained under X-ray irradiation for various pressures (1\u20135 bar) and concentrations (0%\u2013100%). Special care was taken to eliminate effects related to space charge and charge recombination, so that results can be extrapolated following conventional wisdom to those expected for minimum ionizing particles under the typical electric fields employed in gaseous instrumentation. Our study sheds light into the microscopic pathways leading to scintillation in this family of mixtures and reinvigorates the prospects of use in next-generation scintillation-based chambers. 1 Introduction Since their introduction in 1974 (Nygren, 2023), time projection chambers (TPCs) have proved to be one of the most effective ways of detecting particles and reconstructing their trajectories. The versatility of these devices, being compatible with B-fields, allowing readout flexibility and a wide range of density media (from some 10\u2019s of mbar up to 10\u2019s of bar, liquid or even solid phase), makes them the perfect tool to study many different phenomena in particle physics (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al., 2018). Gas-based TPCs commonly operate with admixtures of noble gases with some molecular species, chiefly CH 4 , i-C 4 H 10 , CF 4 or CO 2 . TPCs make use of these additives to reduce the spatial spread and collection time of the primary ionization, minimize photon and ion feedback and, in general, to attain a greater stability. Among them, CF 4 exhibits some particularly interesting properties such as intense and broadband scintillation in the range 150\u2013750 nm under primary (Pansky et al., 1995; Morozov et al., 2010; Morozov et al., 2011) and secondary (field-assisted) (Fraga et al., 2003; Morozov et al., 2012; Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2016) particle excitation, and very low electron diffusion (Christophorou and Olthoff, 2004). The VUV-visible scintillation yields induced by \u03b1 particles in pure CF 4 are found in the range 1,000\u20133,000 ph\/MeV (Pansky et al., 1995; Azmoun et al., 2010; Morozov et al., 2010; Lehaut et al., 2015), optical gains well above 104 have been reported in CF 4 -based mixtures in Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz (2016), while diffusion coefficients have been shown to remain at the thermal limit up to pressure-reduced drift fields as high as 1 kV\/cm\/bar (Christophorou and Olthoff, 2004). Based on the aforementioned observations, CF 4 by itself makes an interesting TPC gas [and has been used to that aim before, e.g., (Takahashi et al., 2011; Battat et al., 2014)]. In fact, CF 4 either pure or admixed with other elements is of great contemporary interest to the optical imaging of rare processes in low-pressure gases (Baracchini et al., 2020; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2023). Ar\/CF 4 admixtures, in particular, have been pioneered by the Fraga and Fraga group at Coimbra already in the 00\u2019s for optical imaging (Fraga et al., 2001; Fraga et al., 2002), and revived recently in an optical-TPC demonstrator equipped with a triple-stack of gas electron multipliers (GEMs), (Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz, 2016; Brunbauer et al., 2018). These works consistently showed a higher optical gain compared to pure CF 4 , with indirect evidence for wavelength-shifting reactions between Ar states and the CF 4 scintillation precursors. Besides the enhanced performance of Ar\/CF 4 mixtures for GEM operation, argon is considerably more cost-effective and environment-friendly than CF 4 . Compared to a traditional wavelength-shifter like N 2 , main advantages of CF 4 are its strong scintillation in the visible range together with a much lower electron diffusion, potentially allowing sharper and brighter tracks from CMOS and CCD cameras, e.g., when instrumenting optical TPCs in the field of nuclear physics (Pomorski et al., 2014; Zimmerman, 2023). Argon has another characteristic relevant to modern instrumentation: it is the element of choice of the DUNE experiment, where it acts simultaneously as target and detection medium both at its far and near detector complexes (Abi et al., 2020). Specifically, an argon-rich high pressure TPC capable of reconstructing low-energy hadrons (down to 10\u2019s of MeV, at least) has been proposed by the collaboration (Abed Abud, 2023). It is called to be the first detector to ever record neutrino interactions in a sparse medium, with 4\u03c0 coverage and broad particle identification (PID) capabilities. In this context, enabling time-tagging through the primary scintillation produced in neutrino interactions, while preserving the argon medium as pure as possible (to avoid parasitic neutrino interactions), is the subject of ongoing investigations (Amedo, 2021; Sa\u00e1-Hern\u00e1ndez, 2023). Time tagging is an essential asset in the study of neutrino oscillations with TPCs as it is used for spill-assignment, absolute estimate of the drift distance and time-of-flight determination of the emerging particles (Manly et al., 2021). With this in mind, we performed a systematic study of the primary scintillation in the Ar\/CF 4 system down to trace-amounts of the molecular additive, in order to better understand its wavelength-shifting capabilities. For that, a spectroscopic analysis was carried out under X-ray irradiation at varying pressures and CF 4 concentrations, at electric fields and ionization densities for which space charge and charge\/light recombination effects are negligible. Following conventional wisdom (e.g. Menzel, 2014; Azevedo et al., 2018), measurements in these conditions should represent a good approximation to the scintillation by minimum ionizing particles, a typical metric for characterizing the response of a particle detector. The present work is structured as follows: in Section 2 the experimental setup and procedures are described, Section 3 compiles the scintillation spectra of the pure gases and Ar\/CF 4 admixtures; in Section 4 we present a minimalistic kinetic model that describes the observations to good accuracy, and we finally end with a comparison with previous results and a summary of our main conclusions in 5. 2 Experimental setup Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the experimental setup. Measurements were performed on a CF63 aluminum-cube serving as a vessel, irradiated with X-rays from a copper tube at 40 kV. The chamber had an entrance window of 1 cm-diameter made of a thin aluminum foil of 50 \u00b5m thickness which was facing the tube. Inside the chamber, an electrifiable cylindrical volume was placed, with 3 cm in diameter and 0.75 cm in height. Its upstream electrode served as a cathode and was made from the same foil as the window. A semitransparent Cr-mesh served as the anode, evaporated on top of a collimating lens (OceanOptics 74-UV) leading to a multi-mode optical fiber (UV-VIS, 600 \u00b5m core) and finally coupled to an OceanOptics FX UV-VIS CCD spectrometer sensitive in the 210\u2013800 nm range. The photon spectrometer was calibrated using a lamp with reference light sources for the UV and the visible regions, coupled to the anode mesh. Both calibrations were merged at around the 300 nm mark. FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1. Schematic drawing of the experimental setup used to conduct the measurements. The x-ray tube is shown to the left, the high-pressure vessel housing the electrifiable scintillating cylinder is shown at the middle. The spectrophotometer is shown to the right. Upon excitation and ionisation of the gas, electrons and ions were collected by means of an uniform electric field, the current being read at the anode with a Keithley picoamperemeter (model 6487). The maximum of the X-ray bremsstrahlung spectrum, when accounting for the absorption in the materials interposed up to the ionization region, was estimated to be at around 12 keV, a characteristic energy for which the X-ray mean free path is 14 cm in argon and 62 cm in CF 4 , in standard conditions (Berger et al., 2010). Even for argon at the highest pressures employed in our measurements (5 bar) the mean free path is as large as 2.8 cm, leading to \u00b110%-level variations within the ionization volume. The size of the ionization cloud (\u03c3) caused by the tortuous trajectory of the ejected photoelectron amounts to about 0.2 cm\/P[bar] in argon (see, e.g., Smirnov, 2005; Azevedo et al., 2016), smaller than the chamber dimensions and negligible in the high pressure data. The additional spread stemming from electron diffusion along a 0.75 cm drift-path, when considering electric fields at full charge-collection, can increase the above figure up to 0.16 mm in the radial direction [Pyboltz, (Al Atoum et al., 2020)]. This situation corresponds to pure Ar at 1 bar, with other conditions involving yet smaller charge spreads by roughly a factor of 1 \/ P [ b a r ] as the pressure increases, and up to another factor of ten as CF 4 concentration increases. Overall, inside the collimated region, ionization can be thus regarded as uniform throughout these measurements, for practical purposes. To exclude space charge and charge-recombination effects, data was taken at no field and at a field high enough to guarantee full charge-collection (Figure 2-left). Along this line, additional measurements were performed for different X-ray intensities too (e.g., Figure 2-right). Under the assumption of uniform irradiation within the collimated region of the scintillation cell (of area A = \u03c0*0.52 cm2), the positive-ion space-charge density (q e \u22c5 dN\/dV| ion ) relates to the steady-state current at full collection through: I sst = 2 q e d N d V ion \u22c5 A \u22c5 \u03bc \u22c5 E ( 2.1 ) with q e being the electron charge, \u03bc the ion mobility, E the electric field, and the factor 2 accounts for the equal sharing of current between ions and electrons. The mobilities were evaluated from the ones measured for the Ar+ ion in Ar in case of pure argon (Walter et al., 2008) and from the ones measured for C F 3 + in Ar in case of Ar\/CF 4 (Santos et al., 2018). Accordingly, the positive-ion space charge ranged in these measurements from 6 pC\/cm3 (for pure CF 4 at around 1 bar and the lowest X-ray intensity) up to 225 pC\/cm3 (for either pure Ar or CF 4 at around 5 bar, and the highest X-ray intensity). At 1 bar these values are about a factor of 4 below those employed in earlier measurements performed under \u03b1 particles in Morozov et al. (2011), and reported to be recombination-free (see Supplementary Appendix for a detailed comparison). Even the highest pressures explored in this work barely exceed the ionization densities studied earlier, which leads us to believe that recombination is negligible in present conditions. The lack of strong deviations from a proportional behavior in Figure 2-right for different intensities of the X-ray tube adds further support to this. FIGURE 2 FIGURE 2. Exemplary scans in electric field and X-ray intensity. Left: current at the anode of the scintillation cell as a function of the applied electric field up to reaching full-collection, for different currents of the X-ray tube (pure CF 4 at 1 bar). Green lines represent identical space charge conditions (i.e., same degree of field distortion by positive ions) according to the parameter \u03b1 introduced in (Palestini and McDonald) and discussed in Section A of the Supplementary Appendix. Right: current at full charge-collection (right axis) and associated ionization density (left axis) calculated using (2.1) as a function of the current of the X-ray tube for CF 4 at 1 and 4 bar (light and dark blue) and pure argon at 2 and 5 bar (red and orange). Each of them was fitted to a proportional trend. (Given the different ion mobility and electrical fields, there is not a global common conversion factor from ionization density to current so each data series includes an additional multiplicative factor in order to transform the right-axis value into the correct one). In order to exclude any space charge effect from the positive ions, the analysis procedure sketched in Palestini and McDonald (2023) was applied. It follows, as discussed in Supplementary Appendix (Section A), that field distortions once the current reached saturation (full collection) were typically at the 5%-level or below (with a maximum field distortion of 15%) during the measurements. The resulting iso-space-charge lines (green dashed, in Figure 2-left) suggest that space charge is the main variable driving the current vs. field behaviour. In the absence of space charge, the extent of fringe fields inside the chamber was evaluated through an axisymmetric finite-element simulation with the COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae package (COMSOL, 2023). As shown in Figure 3-bottom, the electric field is uniform over a region slightly exceeding 2 cm, considerably larger than the size of the ionization volume (collimated down to 1 cm at the chamber entrance -green dashed lines). The values of the electrical potential in 3D, together with the equipotential curves, are shown in Figure 3-top. FIGURE 3 FIGURE 3. Results from an axisymmetric COMSOL simulation, with the X-ray beam impinging from the positive z-axis. Top-left: geometry model and electric potential in 3D. Top-right: cross-section at mid-chamber and equipotential curves. Bottom: electric field component perpendicular to the electrodes at mid-chamber (symmetry plane of the cylinder), as a function of the distance from one of the chamber walls. Prior to the measurements, the chamber was pumped down to 10\u22124 mbar. Ar\/CF 4 mixtures were studied at a volume fraction of 100\/0, 99.9\/0.1, 99.8\/0.2, 99.5\/0.5, 99\/1, 98\/2, 95\/5, 90\/10 and 0\/100, and pressures from 1 to 5 bar. The purity of the bottles was 4.5 (CF 4 ) and 6 (Ar), so the overall purity of the studied mixtures was between 5.5 and 6 (i.e., 1\u20133 ppm contamination). The chamber was first filled with CF 4 until the desired partial pressure, using two pressure\/vacuum gauges, namely, a Pfeiffer Vacuum PCR 280 Pirani\/Capacitance and an MKS pressure transducer, for the readings. Afterwards, argon was admixed. Gas circulation was dimmed unnecessary for proper mixing, as the concentration could be verified by sampling the gas into a residual gas analyzer and waiting for the ratio of the pressures of the species to stabilize. This agrees with the notion that the forced flow of argon gas, being dominant by at least a factor 10 in volume, drives the mixing in such a small chamber. For the lowest CF 4 concentrations, that would be limited by the accuracy of the sensor, the filling was done at high pressure and diluted until the target concentration was achieved. Deviations from the target CF 4 concentrations [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 100]% were quantified through a linear fit and associated uncertainties. Although the target values will be used as plot descriptors in the following, the calibrated values will be used when presenting systematics as well as for model fitting: [0, 0.096 \u00b1 0.015, 0.28 \u00b1 0.024, 0.434 \u00b1 0.026, 0.929 \u00b1 0.071, 1.64 \u00b1 0.14, 5.55 \u00b1 0.21, 10.25 \u00b1 0.39, 100]. Purity was monitored continuously with a residual gas analyzer (RGA) coupled to the main system through a leak valve. The RGA region was kept at a constant pressure of 10\u22125 mbar throughout the measurements by adjusting the leak-valve opening. The main impurities in the system were H 2 O, O 2 and N 2 (CO) and their concentrations were estimated to be below 1000 H 2 O ppm, 15 O 2 ppm and 200 N 2 ppm, being the sensitivity limited by the RGA background. These upper limits, as well as the scintillation yields, showed little variation with time, for a time span of hours. Even if we were to take them as representing the actual concentrations, it has been shown in Margato et al. (2012) that N 2 concentrations as high as 4% are needed to quench CF 4 scintillation by a factor 2 (at 1 bar). Although 1,000 ppms (0.1% per volume) might arguably compete with Ar-CF 4 transfers at about the same CF 4 concentration (the lowest one used in our measurements), the phenomenological model introduced later in text does not show any strong deviation for that case. These observations, together with the nominal purity of the bottles, the use of low-outgassing materials for chamber assembly and the stability of the scintillation yields with time, suggest that the impact of impurities is of little relevance to the results presented in this work. The final scintillation spectrum was divided by the current at full collection, and by the average energy to create an electron-ion pair (W I ). The latter was taken from the directly-measured values in Reinking et al. (1986), except in the range [0\u20131]% CF 4 where a simple linear interpolation was used. An absolute normalization was not attempted and thus the spectrum is hereafter expressed in yield\/eV [a.u.]. As no significant contribution from recombination or space charge was found in present data, the standard deviation of measurements performed for different X-ray intensities has been used to estimate the uncertainty. This accounts for any residual recombination effect as well as systematic errors that may be present in the measurements. 3 Results 3.1 Pure gases Figure 4 shows the scintillation spectra of Ar (top) and CF 4 (bottom) at pressures of 1 bar (blue) and 4 bar (purple). The use of arbitrary units (a.u.) makes explicit the absence of absolute normalization, with every spectrum being divided by the total electron current and separately corrected for the average energy to create an electron (W I ), to obtain scintillation yields per eV. Bands that are easily identifiable are the ones of the 3rd continuum of argon (160\u2013280 nm) (Robert et al., 1995) and the (210\u2013500 nm) and (550\u2013750 nm) ones of CF 4 (Morozov et al., 2010). The visible band centered at around 630 nm has been attributed earlier to the transition C F 3 * ( 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 ) \u2192 C F 3 ( 1 A 1 \u2032 ) (Suto et al., 1983; Washida et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1986) (not being assigned unequivocally to either the 2 A 2 \u2033 or the 1E\u2032 states). The overlapping UV bands can be attributed to the C F 4 + , * ion, emitting from its C \u0303 , D \u0303 states. Transitions C \u0303 \u2192 X \u0303 , A \u0303 can be naturally assigned to the peaks centered around 230 nm and 290 nm (Harshbarger et al., 1972; Lambert et al., 1988; Zhang et al., 1989) while the transition at 364 nm may be assigned to D \u0303 \u2192 C \u0303 . Another prominent UV band at around 260 nm has been observed before, e.g., under excitation within low-energy electron avalanches (Fraga et al., 2003), and can be assigned to the transition C F 3 * ( 2 A 1 \u2032 ) \u2192 C F 3 ( 1 A 2 \u2033 ) (Washida et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1986); it is however hidden in present conditions under the C F 4 + , * emission. The small decrease of the yields in the UV bands as a function of pressure has been observed before in Morozov et al. (2010) and might be naturally attributed to self-quenching. A comparison with data from Morozov et al. (2010) obtained at 1 bar under \u03b1-particle irradiation is shown in Figure 4 (green, dashed), arbitrarily normalized to the 290 nm peak. FIGURE 4 FIGURE 4. Emission spectra per eV of released energy for pure argon (upper plot) and pure CF 4 (lower plot) at 1 and 4 bar (blue, purple), obtained at zero field. No significant dependence with the intensity of the X-ray tube was observed, suggesting that measurements are recombination-free. For pure CF 4 , where full charge-collection could be reached before the onset of secondary scintillation, no dependence with the electric field was observed either. The spectra of argon\u2019s 3rd continuum obtained in Robert et al. (1995) also with X-rays (red-dashed) and the one of CF 4 obtained in Morozov et al. (2010) with \u03b1-particles (green-dashed) are shown for comparison. A global normalization was imposed by setting to 1 the maximum of the 290 nm peak in pure CF 4 at 1 bar. Concerning Ar, the 3rd continuum (cut by the spectrometer bandwidth below 210 nm) agrees in shape with earlier X-ray measurements from Robert et al. (1995), increasing the yield on its blue-wing as the pressure increases, qualitatively in agreement with that work too (red dashed-line). In the near-infrared region the main lines located at 696, 727, 750, 763 and 772 nm can be clearly identified, corresponding to transitions between the 3p54p and 3p54s multiplets (Reader et al., 1980). Their associated yields seem to be dominated by 2-body collisional self-quenching, thus approximately following a \u223c 1 \/ ( a + b P ) trend, except in the case of the 750 nm peak where a \u223c 1 \/ ( a + b P 2 ) trend is observed instead (Figure 5). The strong suppression observed as a function of CF 4 concentration suggests that argon IR-yields will be subdominant in high pressure applications and\/or as soon as a molecular additive is added. FIGURE 5 FIGURE 5. Integrated yields for different argon near-infrared peaks as a function of pressure. Dashed-dotted lines represent a fit to a 2-body self-quenching law while the dashed-green line follows from three-body self-quenching. The presence of impurities can be derived from the peak at around 310 nm, corresponding to the OH*(A2\u03a3+) \u2192 OH(X2\u03a0) transition (M\u00fcller et al., 1993; Masla\u00e1ni and Sember, 2014). It can be attributed to charge transfer between Ar+ and H 2 O+, following dissociative recombination to populate OH* (Masla\u00e1ni and Sember, 2014). Even if barely visible, N 2 peaks at around 335, 355 and 380 nm are present in argon too, as expected from the transfer reactions identified in Takahashi et al. (1983). 3.2 Ar\/CF 4 mixtures Figure 6 compiles the spectra for different Ar\/CF 4 admixtures and pressures. Although they were obtained at zero field, no significant dependence with the X-ray intensity or electric field was observed, demonstrating the absence of recombination effects. This was generally the case except below 1% CF 4 , conditions for which the energy of the ionization electrons is high enough to cause neutral bremsstrahlung radiation (NBrS) during their drift (Buzulutskov et al., 2018; Amedo et al., 2022; Henriques et al., 2022) at the fields required for full charge-collection, thus complicating the interpretation. Exemplary, for the full-collection field of 2900 V\/cm in pure Ar at 1 bar, NBrS would amount to about \u223c 0.015 ph\/eV in the region 210\u2013800 nm (Amedo et al., 2022). Given its flat nature, NBrS easily overwhelms the 3rd continuum in the region around 200\u2013350 nm, if assuming that the integral of the latter amounts to 0.0036 ph\/eV, as recently measured in Santorelli et al. (2021). These results are not presented here as they will be discussed in detail elsewhere. FIGURE 6 FIGURE 6. Emission spectra per eV of released energy for different concentrations of Ar\/CF 4 , at zero field. Measurements are expected to be free from recombination effects, as discussed in text. A global normalization was imposed by setting to 1 the maximum of the 290 nm peak in pure CF 4 at 1 bar. The exact CF 4 concentrations (after calibration) can be found in Figure 13 in (Supplementary Appendix C). Indirectly, the low impact of recombination light in the window 210\u2013800 nm for low CF 4 concentrations may be inferred from: i) its absence for mixtures above 1% CF 4 (e.g., Supplementary Figure SA12 in Supplementary Appendix) for which the ionization densities are similar; ii) the fact that full charge-collection is reached to within less than 5% for all conditions (e.g., Figure 2); iii) the fact that NBrS constitutes a featureless continuum above a certain wavelength threshold depending on the electron energy (Henriques et al., 2022) and, within that assumption, no significant field-induced modification of the characteristic UV and visible bands of the Ar\/CF 4 scintillation could be observed below 1% CF 4 . In the spectra shown in Figure 6 it can be seen that the transition between the pure-argon spectrum and the CF 4 one starts to happen as soon as 0.1% CF 4 is introduced. At that concentration, the appearance of a new peak at 290 nm and the small bump at around the C F 3 * band hint towards a contribution beyond that of direct CF 4 excitation, that would be otherwise suppressed 1,000 times relative to the 100% CF 4 case. The 3rd continuum from argon quenches rapidly as CF 4 increases and it halves for just 0.2% CF 4 . For higher concentrations, the appearance of the C F 4 + , * band associated to the C \u0303 \u2192 X \u0303 transition (centered at 230 nm) obscures the effect. As already noted, the near-infrared emission from argon displays self-quenching as the pressure increases, but it is also strongly suppressed in the presence of CF 4 , becoming undetectable above 5% CF 4 at 5 bar. The N 2 bands resulting from Ar* transfers disappear already at 0.1% CF 4 , suggesting that N 2 contamination is well below that concentration, if recalling that the Ar* quenching rates are comparable for the two molecules (Velazco et al., 1978). The most prominent contamination in the system seems to be H 2 O, that leads to OH* emission at around 310 nm and is arguably driven by Ar+ + H 2 O \u2192 Ar + H 2 O+ charge transfer (Masla\u00e1ni and Sember, 2014). Given the shape-modification observed for the UV band of CF 4 at around 1 bar (where the presence of the OH* peak is most prominent relative to higher pressures), it cannot be fully excluded that H 2 O might have a small influence in that case, specially for low CF 4 concentrations. For high pressures and high CF 4 concentrations, the OH* peak vanishes and the UV spectra stabilizes. Collisional-relaxation of C F 4 + , * ( v ) sates down to the bottom of the potential well C F 4 + , * ( v = 0 ) represents a plausible alternative, that would also explain the emergence of fully-formed UV bands when pressure and CF 4 concentration increases (as Ar is a priori inefficient for this process). Figure 7 compiles the integrated yields in the most representative regions (210\u2013250 nm, 250\u2013350 nm, 350\u2013400 nm and 400\u2013700 nm) for different pressures and as a function of the CF 4 concentration. The trend of the 210\u2013250 nm emission (blue) follows from the quenching of the Ar 3rd continuum, with C F 4 + , * emission from C \u0303 \u2192 X \u0303 taking over as the CF 4 concentration increases, causing a minimum for concentrations around 1% CF 4 . In the other UV bands the increase is monotonous with CF 4 while the visible band shows an optimum for concentrations around or above the ones studied in this work. In general, visible-range yields are significantly increased over the ones in pure CF 4 in the range 2%\u201310%, and can be anticipated beyond the upper concentration studied in this work. A kinetic model addressing the observed behaviour is sketched in the next section. FIGURE 7 FIGURE 7. Integrated scintillation yields for the Ar\/CF 4 system (per eV of released energy), shown in different bands as a function of CF 4 concentration, for different pressures. Zero-concentration yields have been added to the logarithmic x-axis to illustrate the asymptotic behaviour. (The argon peak located at 700 nm and the peaks caused by impurities were removed from this analysis; measurements on pure CF 4 were only carried out at 1 and 4 bar; yields below 10\u22123 are not shown as the uncertainty bar is larger than 100%). 4 Discussion 4.1 Wavelength-shifting pathways Our data presents strong evidence of wavelength-shifting and in particular Figure 7 suggests, qualitatively, that scintillation in the 630 nm band ( C F 3 * ) must feed from Ar* transfers and not just through direct C F 3 * formation, otherwise a proportional trend would be expected. The observed increase (approximately proportional up to 1%CF 4 ) shows a drop above or around 10%CF 4 and might still be attributed to direct C F 3 * formation followed by self-quenching with CF 4 . However this would imply a strong dependence with pressure, that is not seen in data. Figure 8 shows for illustration a spectral comparison with the CF 4 and He\/CF 4 systems, for which the C F 3 * band appears depopulated relative to the UV one, adding further support to the role of Ar* states at C F 3 * formation. Given that the threshold for CF 3 production sits at 12.5 eV (Winters and Inokuti, 1982) and the one for C F 3 + production at around 16 eV (Zhang et al., 1989; Christophorou et al., 1996), the threshold for C F 3 * production must lie in between. This indicates that the Ar* state(s) involved in transfers lie well above the lowest-lying Ar excited states at 11.5 eV and close to the continuum (IP Ar = 15.7 eV), thereby labeled Ar** hereafter. A discussion on the nature of such a state(s) is postponed to the end of this section. On the other hand, the UV scintillation may be tentatively attributed to transfers involving the higher-lying 3rd continuum precursors ( A r n = 2,3 * , + , A r n = 2,3 + + ) (Wieser et al., 2000). The fact that the yields in the region 210\u2013250 nm and 250\u2013350 nm show opposing trends up to around 1% CF 4 , with the total yield remaining approximately constant, is a good indicator that the energy is being transferred between species. The extracted quenching rates and spectral shapes add further support to this interpretation, as shown later. FIGURE 8 FIGURE 8. Comparison between the primary scintillation spectrum for pure CF 4 (orange), Ar\/CF 4 at 10% per volume (green) and He\/CF 4 at 20% per volume (blue), at 1 bar. All spectra have been arbitrarily normalized to the 290 nm UV peak. A kinetic model has been developed keeping the above considerations in mind, in order to quantitatively interpret our experimental results. It is sketched in Figure 9 and detailed in the following. FIGURE 9 FIGURE 9. Kinetic scheme used to describe wavelength-shifting in Ar\/CF 4 mixtures. The main scintillation drivers are the C F 4 + , * , C F 3 * and Ar 3rd continuum states. Energy considerations lead to the hypothesis of an additional high-lying Ar** state, whose nature is discussed in text. Aiming at a reduced number of model parameters, the 3rd continuum precursors are characterized through an effective decay constant of 5 ns (e.g., Santorelli et al., 2021): A r n = 2,3 + , \u2217 , A r n = 2,3 + + \u2192 \u03c4 3 r d A r + + A r + + A r + h \u03bd 180 \u2212 300 n m ( 4.1 ) For CF 4 , the states that leave a clear footprint in the spectra can be matched to the following decays: C F 3 * 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 \u2192 \u03c4 C F 3 C F 3 1 A 1 \u2032 + h \u03bd 630 n m ( 4.2 ) C F 4 + , * C \u0303 \u2192 \u03c4 C F 4 C \u2212 > X C F 4 + X \u0303 + h \u03bd 230 n m ( 4.3 ) C F 4 + , * C \u0303 \u2192 \u03c4 C F 4 C \u2212 > A C F 4 + , * A \u0303 + h \u03bd 290 n m ( 4.4 ) To the best of our knowledge, not all the possible decays of the accessible C F 4 + , * states have been observed in literature, e.g., C F 4 + , * ( B ) \u2192 C F 4 + , * ( A ) . As C F 4 + , * states are unstable (Zhang et al., 1989), it is possible that dissociation out-competes radiative decay in some of them. For the states involved in Eqs 4.2\u20134.4, however, we opted to assign a decay probability of 100% to avoid the introduction of new additional parameters. As shown later, a good \u03c72 is obtained in the proposed kinetic scheme through a global fit employing two parameters per spectral region (UV and visible), so a further increase in the number of parameters was deemed unnecessary. Transfer reactions between Ar states and CF 4 represent the last ingredient. For the visible component, we make the natural assumption that transfers between the Ar** state(s) and CF 4 compete just with self-quenching, summarized as: A r * * + C F 4 \u2192 k A r * * \u2212 > C F 3 * A r + C F 3 * 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 ( 4.5 ) A r * * + A r \u2192 k A r * * \u2212 > A r * A r * + A r ( 4.6 ) It is in principle possible to include an additional non-radiative quenching channel of Ar** with CF 4 , that has been neglected again on the basis that it is not needed to describe data and it would add unnecessary complexity to the model. Within the proposed kinetic scheme, Ar** transfers would lead to C F 3 * scintillation with near-100% probability. Last, we consider transfer reactions leading to UV emission between the 3rd continuum precursors and CF 4 , together with a quenching reaction to non-radiative states: A r n = 2,3 + , \u2217 A r n = 2,3 + + + C F 4 \u2192 k A r 3 rd \u2212 > C F 4 + , * A r + C F 4 + * C \u0303 ( 4.7 ) A r n = 2,3 + , \u2217 A r n = 2,3 + + + C F 4 \u2192 k A r 3 rd \u2212 > A r n o n \u2212 r a d i a t i v e ( 4.8 ) where rates for transfer and non-radiative quenching have been introduced for an \u201ceffective\u201d 3rd continuum precursor. Along this line, reactions of 3rd continuum states with ground-state Ar are assumed to be already accounted for when considering the kinetics of such an \u201ceffective\u201d precursor, and remain unaltered in the presence of CF 4 [for a detailed pathway scheme of the 3rd continuum formation, the reader is referred to Wieser et al. (2000)]. In the following, reaction rates [t\u22121] are defined for 1 bar of the reactive, and scaled based on pressure and species concentration [as done for instance in Azevedo et al. (2018)]. Before evaluating the model, it should be noted that the possibility of self-quenching of the C F 3 * ( 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 ) state with CF 4 has been omitted due to the negligible pressure-dependence of Ar\/CF 4 scintillation in the 630 nm band. C F 4 + , * states, on the other hand, evidence a small self-quenching on the UV region in pure CF 4 , compounded with the aforementioned indications of collisional relaxation for Ar\/CF 4 mixtures at low pressures and CF 4 concentrations. Such dependences with pressure can be easily included in the model but, being a small effect and not shedding light into the main transfer mechanisms, they have been omitted for the sake of simplicity. The near-visible band centered around 364 nm, arising from the D \u0303 \u2192 C \u0303 transition, is also not considered given its relatively small contribution to the total spectrum. From the above set of reactions 4.1\u20134.8 it is possible to derive the scintillation probability (per eV of energy deposited in the medium) of the states C F 3 ( 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 ) , C F 4 + , * ( C \u0303 ) , and of the effective state Ar3rd: P \u03b3 , C F 3 \u2217 = f C F 4 \u22c5 P \u03b3 , C F 3 \u2217 dir + 1 \u2212 f C F 4 \u22c5 P A r * * \u22c5 K A r * * \u2212 > C F 3 \u2217 K A r * * \u2212 > C F 3 \u2217 + 1 \u2212 f C F 4 f C F 4 \u22c5 K A r * * \u2212 > A r * ( 4.9 ) P \u03b3 , C F 4 + \u2217 = f C F 4 \u22c5 P \u03b3 , C F 4 + \u2217 dir + 1 \u2212 f C F 4 \u22c5 P A r 3 rd \u22c5 f C F 4 \u22c5 n \u22c5 K A r 3 rd \u2212 > C F 4 + \u2217 1 \/ \u03c4 3 rd + f C F 4 \u22c5 n \u22c5 K A r 3 rd \u2212 > C F 4 + \u2217 + K A r 3 rd \u2212 > A r ( 4.10 ) P \u03b3 , A r 3 rd = 1 \u2212 f C F 4 \u22c5 P A r 3 rd \u22c5 1 \/ \u03c4 3 rd 1 \/ \u03c4 3 rd + f C F 4 \u22c5 n \u22c5 K A r 3 rd \u2212 > C F 4 + * + K A r 3 rd \u2212 > A r ( 4.11 ) Here f C F 4 represents the CF 4 concentration, n equals the pressure ratio P\/P 0 , and the quenching and transfer rates are the ones defined in Eqs 4.5\u20134.8. Parameters with subscript \u2018dir\u2019 refer to the probability of direct scintillation, and P A r * * , P A r 3 rd stand for the formation probability of the Ar** state(s) and of the 3rd continuum precursors, respectively. Some of the parameters needed to evaluate the above equations can be constrained based on existing experimental data, including this work. The direct scintillation probabilities, for instance, as well as the probability of formation of 3rd continuum precursors, can be obtained from the yields in pure CF 4 and pure argon. The time constant for the argon 3rd continuum has been taken from Santorelli et al. (2021). Further, based on the model structure, only the ratio of Ar** transfer to quenching rates in Eq. 4.9 is relevant, reducing the total number of fit parameters to four. The other three parameters represent the formation probability of Ar** states, and the non-radiative quenching and transfer rates of C F 4 + , * . The model structure also makes explicit the lack of pressure-dependence of C F 3 * scintillation observed for any admixture. A weighted global fit of the proposed kinetic model to the three data series associated with the 230, 290 and 630 nm bands was performed. Yields in the first two bands were fitted to a sum of Eqs 4.10, 4.11 and the 630 nm band was described through Eq. 4.9. The fit is shown in Figure 10 for a pressure of 4 bar (blue, orange, red lines), alongside the corresponding experimental data (full circles). Its reduced \u03c72 of 1.56 adds plausibility to the present interpretation. The following values and uncertainties were obtained for the fit parameters: P A r * * \/ P A r 3 rd = 3.19 \u00b1 0.39 (population of Ar** relative to that of 3rd continuum precursors); K A r * * \u2212 > C F 3 * K A r * * \u2212 > A r * = 36.5 \u00b1 7.9 (ratio of transfer to collisional quenching of Ar**); K A r 3 rd \u2212 > C F 4 + * = 49 \u00b1 18 ns\u22121 (transfer rate of the Ar 3rd continuum) and K A r 3 rd \u2212 > A r = 4.1 \u00b1 3.3 ns\u22121 (non-radiative quenching rate of the Ar 3rd continuum). Within the proposed kinetic model, the ratio of transfer-mediated scintillation to direct scintillation can be computed: for 1% CF 4 , illustratively, values as large as 72 \u00b1 20 (visible) and 20.9 \u00b1 2.1 (UV) are obtained. FIGURE 10 FIGURE 10. Top row: scintillation spectra for different CF 4 concentrations at 4 bar, zoomed in the ultraviolet (left) and visible (right) regions. Bottom row: integrated yields on the ultraviolet (left) and visible (right) regions (shown as closed circles), superimposed to the kinetic model introduced in text. The experimental value for zero concentration is added on the bottom-left plot at 0.001% CF 4 , taking advantage of the fact that the model asymptotically tends to a constant in that case. In the UV-band, a detailed analysis of the spectral shapes (Figure 10 top-left) brings additional support to the proposed interpretation: as soon as 0.1% CF 4 is added to argon, there is a strong suppression of the argon 3rd continuum, coinciding with the appearance of the 290 nm peak from C F 4 + , * . For 1% CF 4 , the effect is even more clear. Taking as a reference the yields measured earlier for \u03b1-particles in the Ar 3rd continuum [around 3,500 ph\/MeV (Santorelli et al., 2021)] and in the VUV-visible range of CF 4 [1,000\u20133,000 ph\/MeV (Pansky et al., 1995; Azmoun et al., 2010; Morozov et al., 2010; Lehaut et al., 2015)], it is implausible that direct CF 4 excitation could be responsible for the observed levels of X-ray scintillation when the species is present at a mere sub-percent level. Above 1% CF 4 , the overlap between argon 3rd continuum and the C F 4 + , * emission at 230 nm complicates a qualitative description, and a direct comparison with the proposed kinetic model has to be used instead (Figure 10 bottom-left). In any case, the fact that the number of photons emitted in the UV region is maintained approximately constant when transfer reactions dominate (i.e., below a few % CF 4 ) reinforces the idea that the kinetics of the Ar 3rd continuum states drives the UV scintillation of the admixture, and that the C F 4 + , * state scintillates efficiently upon transfer, as assumed. Although the agreement seems convincing, additional support to the proposed pathway scheme can be found: according to the model, the scintillation of the argon 3rd continuum gets quenched down to just 8.6% \u00b1 2.8% of its nominal value in the pure gas when in presence of 1% CF 4 . This is compatible with the quenching level that has been reported for the Ar 3rd continuum when admixed with CO 2 , at about 1% concentration (Strickler and Arakawa, 1964). Given that both CF 4 and CO 2 are energetically accessible to transfers from the high-lying A r 2,3 + , * and A r 2,3 + + states, and the similar molecule size, this approximate agreement is reassuring. In the visible band, the proposed model where C F 3 * formation competes with self-quenching provides a natural explanation for the total absence of pressure dependencies. It requires, however, the somewhat artificial introduction of a new Ar** state or set of states. Invoking the 3rd continuum precursors cannot be excluded, although it would require increasing the model complexity substantially: the behaviour of the transfer reactions involved in UV and visible scintillation (Figure 10-bottom) is too different to be easily attributable to the same state. As discussed earlier, the existence of Ar** states is justified by energy considerations, given that they must be several eV above the Ar* 2nd continuum precursors at around 11.5 eV, yet below the argon IP (15.7 eV) in order to induce excited dissociation of C F 3 * . According to our model, the formation probability of Ar** is about \u00d7 3 that of Ar3rd states, that would imply [if using for reference the 2nd and 3rd continuum yields measured in Santorelli et al. (2021)] a substantial part of the available Ar excited states being eligible for transfer (about 50%). Also, the transfer rate would need to be nearly 40 times larger than self-quenching with Ar (36.5 \u00b1 7.9 from our fit) and it remains open which mechanism could cause such large transfer values. Although the role of the Ar** states cannot be excluded from present results, there is an alternative explanation in the formation of an Ar C F 3 * exciplex. There is apparently no information in literature about this process that is, e.g., generally absent in the modelling of Ar\/CF 4 discharges (Bi et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2018; Toneli et al., 2019). ArCF 3 is iso-electronic with C F 4 \u2212 that is in fact known not to be stable, except in the presence of C F 4 n clustering (Gutsev and Adamowicz, 1995). There are suggestions of the formation of the (expectedly more stable) C F 4 \u2212 , * state in some works (e.g., Kumar et al., 2008), but not enough evidence is provided. If the binding energy of such an exciplex would be on the order of few eV, it is conceivable that it could be formed starting from the long-lived A r 2 * triplet state. Although speculative at the moment, such a mechanism would provide a natural explanation for the lack of pressure-dependence, the similarity between the populations of Ar** and 2nd continuum precursors, as well as for the preponderance of wls-transfers in Ar compared to, e.g., He. 4.2 Comparison with previous results The results obtained in this work may be compared with the ones obtained for Ar\/CF 4 mixtures in a 9 MeV proton beam at 1 bar in Liu et al. (2012). Little details are found there in regard to space charge, recombination and beam-induced scintillation and in fact the relative normalization of the visible\/UV bands is not given either. Qualitatively, it is possible to see that the relative increase in both the visible and UV bands from 1% to 10% CF 4 concentrations is around a factor 3, compatible with present results. The region above 700 nm is characterized by the presence of an additional molecular emission while the Ar IR emission appears fully quenched, both observations being in stark contrast with our results. The absence of data for pure CF 4 together with the strong contamination found for argon data in that work, preclude any estimate of the photon yields or wavelength-shifting capability. A spectral comparison between scintillation induced by X-rays (this work) and \u03b1-particles [in Morozov et al. (2010)] seems more reliable at this point, and can be seen in Figure 4 (green, dashed). Both spectra were obtained at 1 bar, arbitrarily normalized to the 290 nm peak. They display an approximate agreement in the UV and blue regions, however the emission in the red region appears off by a factor of 2.8. The discrepancy is preserved when considering the ratio between the other two UV peaks and the C F 3 * ( 2 A 2 \u2033 , 1 E \u2032 ) \u2192 C F 3 ( 1 A 1 \u2032 ) one at 630 nm. These transitions are well above the calibration mark of the lamp at 300 nm and also far enough into the visible region so that we can safely exclude any strong wavelength-asymmetry of the light collection process in the chamber compared to the calibration setup. As no hints of charge recombination were observed at 1 bar neither in Morozov et al. (2010) nor in this work, these measurements point to a fundamental difference between the scintillation mechanisms for \u03b1 particles and X-rays in CF 4 . Last, it must be recalled that the strength of CF 4 scintillation in the VUV-visible range, as obtained for \u03b1 particles at 1 bar, is currently found at levels of 1,000\u20133,000 ph\/MeV (Pansky et al., 1995; Azmoun et al., 2010; Morozov et al., 2010; Lehaut et al., 2015). Values within this range have been reported, too, for Ar\/CF 4 mixtures around 10 bar in Amedo (2021). Nonetheless, the large experimental spread on the above CF 4 yields, together with the particle-dependence of the spectral emission reported here, call for future studies on the scintillation yields of these type of mixtures. 5 Conclusion We have presented a comprehensive data-set on the primary scintillation spectra of Ar\/CF 4 mixtures in the pressure range 1\u20135 bar and CF 4 concentrations from 0.1% to 10%, including pure gases. Our results, obtained under strong X-ray irradiation yet in conditions shown to be free from recombination and space charge effects, provide a clear indication that Ar 3rd-continuum precursors play a pivotal role in the UV-scintillation of Ar\/CF 4 mixtures. On the other hand, a high-laying Ar** state or an Ar C F 3 * exciplex seem the most plausible candidates leading to C F 3 * formation (responsible for the scintillation in the visible range), with a simple pathway scheme explaining the observed phenomenology, in particular the lack of pressure-dependence of the measured yields. The proposed kinetic model resorts to just four parameters (two per emission band), achieving a satisfactory agreement with a reduced \u03c72 of 1.56. A more complex mechanism starting from the precursors of the Ar 3rd continuum could still be advocated to cause scintillation in the visible range, however its elucidation does not seem accessible to present experimental conditions. In sum, wavelength-shifting in the Ar\/CF 4 system is very strong for the conditions studied: at a mere 2% CF 4 , for instance, scintillation in the 500\u2013700 nm ( C F 3 * ) band exceeds that of pure CF 4 with independence from pressure. UV scintillation remains at strengths comparable to the visible one in the concentration range 1%\u201310% CF 4 , and progressively dominates outside it. Overall, upon just 1% CF 4 addition, the ratio of transfer-mediated scintillation to direct scintillation is estimated to be as large as 72 \u00b1 20 (visible) and 20.9 \u00b1 2.1 (UV). Our measurements convey as well strong evidence of the dependence of the spectra of emission on particle type. The ratio of the UV\/visible bands, as observed for X-rays in this work, is about \u00d7 2.8 larger than measured earlier for \u03b1\u2019s in pure CF 4 at around 1 bar, both performed in recombination-free conditions. Overall, the presented results show great promise for technological applications in future particle detectors in the fields of rare event searches, nuclear and neutrino physics.

        "text":"Share this Article Facebook Twitter Email You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license. University Duke University Probiotics, specifically lactobacillus, demonstrated a significant ability to delay a COVID infection and reduce symptoms among unvaccinated people who had been in contact with someone in their home diagnosed with COVID, researchers report in a new study. The randomized, placebo-controlled study suggests that probiotics could be a relatively simple and inexpensive approach to treating people after a COVID exposure. The finding could be a timely intervention as COVID-tracking data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show hospital admissions and deaths on the rise in the US at the same time holiday celebrations will bring people together. Additionally, fewer than 20% of the US population has received the 2023 updated COVID vaccine, according to the most recent CDC data. \u201cPrior to COVID, there was strong evidence that probiotics were protective against respiratory infections,\u201d says Paul Wischmeyer, associate vice chair for clinical research in Duke University\u2019s anesthesiology department and co-lead author of the study in the journal Clinical Nutrition. \u201cOnce COVID hit, it was imperative to determine whether this simple, well-tolerated intervention could be useful. Our study provides encouraging evidence for the use of probiotics.\u201d Wischmeyer and colleagues launched their investigation in March 2020, prior to widespread vaccine availability in the United States. Patients were enrolled if they were unvaccinated and had been exposed to someone with COVID, but had not yet exhibited symptoms. The study enrolled 182 participants, with half randomly assigned to take a probiotic of lactobacillus and the other half randomized to take a placebo pill. Neither study participants nor administrators knew who was receiving the active therapy. Wischmeyer says the study enrollment period was shortened because the pool of eligible participants declined as vaccines became more commonplace and infections began leveling off prior to the Delta wave. Upon analysis, the researchers found that participants randomized to receive the probiotic were 60% less likely to develop COVID symptoms compared to those randomized to receive placebo\u201426.4% vs. 42.9%. The probiotic participants were also able to stave off infection longer compared to those receiving the dummy pill. Although the probiotic group had a numerically lower incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis, the rate did not meet statistical significance (8.8% COVID diagnosis rate in probiotic vs. 15.4% COVID diagnosis rate in control group) because of the study size. \u201cWe are actually not surprised by these findings,\u201d Wischmeyer says. \u201cThere have been several studies that have demonstrated the strong efficacy of probiotics against respiratory infections, including a very large study among babies in India that was published in Nature in 2017. \u201cOther early studies have shown that probiotics may also enhance the effect of vaccines against other viral illnesses, such as influenza.\u201d Wischmeyer cited evidence that probiotics improve immune function in several ways, including increasing the population of regulatory T-cells, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing the lung\u2019s protective barrier against infection, and modulating antiviral gene expression. \u201cWhile limited in sample size, our study lends credence to the notion that our symbiotic microbes can be valuable partners in the fight against COVID-19 and potentially other future pandemic diseases,\u201d Wischmeyer says. \u201cThis may be particularly relevant in under-resourced nations where vaccination rates have lagged and even in the US, where COVID boosters are not widely accessed.\u201d The Duke Microbiome Center and private philanthropic donations supported the work. DSM\/iHealth donated the probiotic and placebo pills for the trial, but had no role in the study\u2019s design, conduct, analysis, or writing. Source: Duke University",

Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit. Malone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable. The key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.] Experts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.] Ang\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument. \u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d Indeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination. In addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d Fisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d. Some of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said. All three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said. Scientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for. But even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out. There\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations. On the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible. You can read the original Washington Times article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK: Emma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel: I will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this. Viruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease. For most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and\/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms. Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently. But most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape. Thus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both. What\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination. Finally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for. While it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation. In short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination. Finally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza? The base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host. Particularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%. Further, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected). Exposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent. Dale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore: This article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO. Flawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission. Flawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies. Flawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely. Flawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary. It is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice. Ang\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs: The article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place: About assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate. Some of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it! About assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links. It is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination. About assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity. ANNOTATIONS The statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity). \u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes.

Because pregnant and lactating mothers were initially excluded from the clinical trials that led to the COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 authorization, the safety of vaccines for that group of persons provided fertile ground for vaccine misinformation, as numerous Health Feedback reviews on the subject can attest to. In this Insight article, we\u2019ll review what is known about the presence of mRNAs from COVID-19 vaccines in breast milk. We\u2019ll discuss the study by Hanna et al., and explain why its findings don\u2019t mean health concerns for babies. Studies indicate vaccine mRNA mostly remains at the injection site, though small amounts disseminate throughout the body Vaccines using the mRNA technology are made of single strands of RNA inside small lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The vaccine mRNA carries information coding for producing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After injection, the LNPs can enter the recipient\u2019s cells, which use their molecular machinery to translate the spike mRNA into the spike protein. The presence of spike then triggers an immune response that will train the body to better respond against infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Data on the biodistribution of the spike mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines in the body are limited. However, preexisting results from other studies suggested that it was plausible that at least some mRNA from the vaccine reached the mammary glands. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided information on the biodistribution of LNPs similar to those used in COVID-19 vaccines after intramuscular injection in rats. The data showed LNPs could be detected throughout the body in the few hours following injections. The LNPs concentrated most at the injection sites, followed by local lymph nodes, the liver, and the spleen. Following injection, the level of LNP in tissues progressively decreased. In its assessment reports of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the EMA wrote: \u201cOnly a relatively small fraction of the administered mRNA-1647 dose distributed to distant tissues, and the mRNA constructs did not persist past 1 to 3 days in tissues other than the injection site, lymph nodes, and spleen\u201d. A 2017 study on a prototype of mRNA flu vaccine also found that the vaccine mostly accumulated at the injection site, with lower concentrations in tissues such as lymph nodes or the liver. The vaccine mRNA could also be detected in other tissues at concentrations that were one hundred to one thousand times lower[2]. There is also evidence that the mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines reaches the blood: researchers observed spike mRNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the blood of vaccinated people up to fifteen days after vaccination[3]. Therefore, the available data indicate that mRNA from vaccines mostly remains at the site of injection, although much smaller amounts can reach the blood and other organs. In light of these data, the presence of some vaccine mRNA in mammary glands and possibly in breast milk is plausible. COVID-19 vaccine mRNA is transiently excreted into breast milk Although initial results suggested that the vaccine mRNA didn\u2019t reach breast milk[4], later studies reported limited presence of the spike mRNA from vaccines in the milk of lactating women. In 2021, Low et al. detected spike mRNA in the breast milk of three out of ten (30%) lactating mothers who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine[5]. A 2022 study by Yeo et al. also reported mRNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 13% of lactating mothers[6] (4 out of 31). Similarly, Hanna et al. published two studies identifying vaccine mRNA in breast milk. The first study detected mRNA up to 45 hours after vaccination. More specifically, they found that the mRNA accumulated in breast milk extracellular vesicles, which are natural lipid nanoparticles produced by the body[7]. The same team later confirmed its discovery by detecting vaccine mRNA after 50% of doses given to 13 women[1], but only during the first 48 hours after vaccination. In summary, data on this subject has been available since 2021, indicating that the mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines can occasionally pass into breast milk. Thus, the study by Hanna et al. from 2023 didn\u2019t report a bombshell discovery nor did it uncover a medical scandal, contrary to what some social media users implied (more on that below). However, results by Hanna et al. also suggest that the vaccine mRNA present in breast milk may have no biological effects on lactating mothers or breastfeeding babies, as we will explain in the next section. mRNA vaccines in milk are in trace amounts and not functional Because we know now that the mRNA from vaccines can pass into breast milk, it is reasonable to ask ourselves whether this could bear any consequences on breastfeeding babies and whether we should be worried about it. However, data also suggest that this mRNA may have no biological effect. First, the vaccine mRNA can be found in breast milk in only very low amounts. Low et al. explained in their study, \u201cWe detected negligible amounts of BNT162b2 mRNA in a minority of human milk samples using a very sensitive assay\u201d[5]. Yeo et al. said that the level of mRNA detected in their study was \u201clow\u201d[6] and Hanna et al. said they only found \u201ctrace amounts\u201d[7]. Hanna et al. doubled down on that statement in their follow-up study by concluding \u201cthe mRNA was only occasionally detected in BM [breast milk], in trace amounts\u201d[1]. Hanna et al. also carried out a more in-depth analysis of the vaccine mRNA found in breast milk. First, they analyzed whether the mRNA strands were still in their native, full-length form, as they were in the vaccine. The study found that most of the vaccine mRNA in the milk had degraded into fragments. Only 12% to 25% of it was still intact. Second, Hanna et al. determined whether the vaccine mRNA in breast milk still retained the ability to induce spike protein production in cells. To do so, the authors exposed lab-grown gut cells to vaccine mRNA-containing breast milk or to the vaccine itself. Although the decision to use gut cells for this experiment wasn\u2019t explained in the article, it was most likely done to simulate what happens when babies drink and digest breast milk. If the gut cells did produce the spike protein when directly exposed to the vaccine, it would confirm that the choice of these cells is appropriate because they have the inherent capability to respond to the vaccine\u2014this is what is called a \u201cpositive control\u201d. If the cells express the spike protein when exposed to breast milk, it would indicate that the vaccine mRNA from the milk is still functional. The results showed that the cells expressed spike when directly exposed to the vaccine but not when exposed to the mRNA harvested from breast milk. This is an important result because it indicates that the vaccine mRNA in breast milk isn\u2019t functional. This means that even if ingested during breastfeeding, it wouldn\u2019t lead to spike protein production in the baby and an immune response. COVID-19 vaccines are beneficial for pregnant or lactating women Pregnant women are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19 than the general population. Getting COVID-19 while pregnant is also associated with a higher risk of negative pregnancy outcomes, like miscarriage and stillbirth[8-11]. Even though clinical data about vaccine safety specifically for pregnant women were lacking at first, the vulnerability of this group to COVID-19 and the dire consequences it could have on their health shifted the risk-benefit assessment, leading public health agencies to recommend vaccination. Later on, clinical studies confirmed that getting vaccinated during pregnancy was safe for the mother and the baby[12]. Similarly, clinical data available so far indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for breastfeeding mothers and breastfed children with no associated severe reactions[13,14]. Furthermore, breast milk from vaccinated mothers could actually provide protection against COVID-19. Indeed, breast milk is known to contain antibodies that can help fight infection and pass to the baby during feeding. Numerous studies showed that breast milk from vaccinated mothers contains antibodies that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and can pass to the baby during feeding. This could help protect babies from COVID-19, particularly those who are too young to be vaccinated against COVID-19[6, 15-22]. Claims exaggerated the significance of study on vaccine mRNA in breast milk Reacting to the publication of Hanna et al. in 2023, some people implied that the study had revealed results contradicting official guidance by public health agencies that the vaccine mRNA would only remain at the site of injection. For instance, YouTuber and former nurse instructor John Campbell presented the study as \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d that the mRNA from the vaccines \u201cgoes everywhere\u201d in the body, contrary to what \u201cwe were initially told\u201d. French YouTuber Idriss Aberkane claimed, \u201cthe mRNA from \u201cvaccines\u201d goes into breast milk\u2026although we were told it would never go there\u201d. However, this misrepresents reality. The fact that the mRNA mostly accumulates at the injection site doesn\u2019t mean that there is absolutely no vaccine mRNA elsewhere. Rather, it means that the large majority of it can be found near the injection site. As we explained in the previous section, the presence of very low amounts of vaccine mRNA in tissues other than the injection site is consistent with the biodistribution data collected and published by health agencies prior to the vaccines\u2019 authorization. Furthermore, the occasional presence of vaccine mRNA in breast milk has been known since 2021. Thus, Campbell and Aberkane\u2019s statements exaggerated the novelty of the 2023 study by Hanna et al. Campbell also implied that the presence of vaccine mRNA in milk could be dangerous to breastfeeding babies. He called for \u201clarge-scale epidemiological surveys\u201d to find out if breastfeeding post-vaccination was safe. Others were more explicit. Retsef Levi, a professor at the Operations Management Group of the Sloan School of Management at MIT, claimed that Hanna et al. \u201craised concerns of babies\u2019 exposure to toxic mRNA via breastfeeding moms\u201d. Both Campbell and Levi are known for propagating COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. But as we explained earlier, the study had found that vaccine mRNA could only be detected during a short period of time and at a very low level in breast milk. The study also found that this mRNA is mostly degraded into pieces and is not functional. Campbell actually dismissed these results, arguing that researchers may not have used the right type of cells to determine whether vaccine mRNA was biologically active. However, positive control data presented in the study (Figure 2 from Hanna et al. 2023) clearly show that these cells are capable of responding to vaccine mRNA, contradicting Campbell. We also cited clinical and epidemiological studies showing that babies from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy or breastfeeding didn\u2019t have specific adverse reactions[12-14]. Thus, data available so far don\u2019t provide a plausible basis for claims that vaccine mRNA occasionally found in breast milk could pose a threat to babies or their mothers. Conclusion In summary, all data available so far indicate that the vaccine mRNA has little to no effect on breastfed babies. Indeed, it is only detected on occasion, and in very low amounts, in breast milk. Furthermore, data indicate that most of this mRNA is degraded. The presence of trace amounts of mRNA is also compatible with what was already known. Biodistribution data indicate that the mRNA transiently disseminates in the body before being mostly cleared out for tissues away from the injection site. Therefore, the data made available in 2023 about the presence of vaccine mRNA is breast milk aren\u2019t likely to fragilize the body of evidence already available showing that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for pregnant or lactating women and, in fact, are particularly useful to this group.

        "text":"CLAIM \u201cthe COVID vaccines have killed millions of people worldwide, an estimated 1 death per 1,000 doses on average in a standard population\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Steve Kirsch, Substack, 1 Dec. 2023 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: New Zealand\u2019s excess mortality statistics contradict the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed one in a thousand people. Over 90% of adults in New Zealand were vaccinated in 2021, a year that actually saw negative excess mortality, or fewer deaths compared to the pre-pandemic baseline. KEY TAKE AWAY Unlike many other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand experienced fewer deaths compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in 2020 and 2021, as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Since the restrictions were lifted, mortality rates in the elderly have risen. This is likely due to a return of respiratory viruses like the flu, and likely represents a return to baseline mortality, not an increase in excess mortality due to COVID-19 vaccines. Published studies so far have found no association between COVID-19 vaccines and an increased mortality risk. FULL CLAIM: \u201cData from the New Zealand Ministry of Health shows that the COVID vaccines have killed over 10 million worldwide\u201d; \u201cthe COVID vaccines have killed millions of people worldwide, an estimated 1 death per 1,000 doses on average in a standard population\u201d REVIEW On 30 November 2023, entrepreneur Steve Kirsch gave a talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claiming that New Zealand data showed COVID-19 vaccines have \u201ckilled over 10 million worldwide\u201d. Kirsch, who had been invited to speak by the student group MIT Students for Open Inquiry, has a record of propagating vaccine misinformation. As documented in previous reviews by Health Feedback, Kirsch\u2019s claims frequently rely on methodologically flawed analyses. The video recording of Kirsch\u2019s talk has been archived here and the slides he presented during the talk can be found here. The Rumble video of the talk has been viewed more than 217,000 times. The New Zealand data used by Kirsch turned out to be personal health information taken from government databases without authorization by Barry Young, a database administrator who worked for Te Whatu Ora, New Zealand\u2019s public health agency. The New Zealand Herald reported that Young was arrested on 3 December 2023 in connection with the privacy breach and has been charged with \u201caccessing a computer system for dishonest purposes\u201d. Prior to his arrest, Young had appeared in a video with Liz Gunn, a former TV presenter and anti-vaccine campaigner, which revealed that he had taken the data from the database. He had appeared under the pseudonym \u201cWinston Smith\u201d (the name of the protagonist in George Orwell\u2019s novel \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d). Kirsch uploaded the illegally acquired data online and signaled to his Substack readers that they could download the data for themselves, although he also claimed to have anonymized the data. Te Whatu Ora has since been granted an injunction to prevent any publication of the data to protect the privacy of those affected by the breach. Kirsch and other individuals have had their accounts on private hosting services taken down after using these services to host the data. In this review, we examine the claims made by Kirsch and explain why the claims cannot be substantiated by the New Zealand data that he obtained. We will also present the evidence showing that, contrary to the claim, COVID-19 vaccination isn\u2019t responsible for \u201cmillions of deaths worldwide\u201d. How the analysis was performed According to a Substack post published by Kirsch on 1 December 2023, the New Zealand data he used consisted of health records linked to four million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, out of the 12 million administered in the country so far. The data came from the pay-per-dose program and included information such as the type of vaccine the person received, as well as their date of birth and death, if death occurred. Kirsch\u2019s analysis used what he called a \u201ctime-cohort series analysis\u201d, which he considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d, a claim that wasn\u2019t substantiated with evidence. To do this, he plotted the number of deaths that occurred in the months after COVID-19 vaccination. He concluded that COVID-19 vaccines were responsible for millions of deaths based on the fact that his analysis showed deaths rose in the first six months after vaccination in those aged 60 and above. The same trend was also seen in an overall analysis for all ages (shown in slides 136 to 140). If the COVID-19 vaccines were safe, he argued, then mortality in vaccinated people should have fallen or remain unchanged, with the exception of the first three weeks post-vaccination. According to Kirsch, a rise in mortality in the first three weeks post-vaccination could be explained by the healthy vaccinee effect (asserted in slide 13), but not for any later rise in mortality. For Kirsch, a later increase in deaths could only be due to vaccines. The healthy vaccinee effect can come about because vulnerable people who are more likely to get vaccinated are also more likely to die compared to the general population. But Kirsch provided no reliable evidence to support the assumption that this effect can only last for three weeks or that only COVID-19 vaccines can explain later deaths. He previously applied the same method to U.S. Medicare data to claim \u201cCOVID vaccines increase your risk of dying\u201d, which Health Feedback analyzed back in March 2023. This Medicare analysis also appeared during his talk at MIT. In our earlier review, we found that Kirsch\u2019s Medicare data analysis didn\u2019t account for the effects of seasonality and COVID-19 waves. As such, his analysis incorrectly attributed deaths from COVID-19 and seasonal illnesses to COVID-19 vaccines. The caveats and limitations of Kirsch\u2019s analysis There are more important caveats and weaknesses associated with Kirsch\u2019s analysis. Firstly, we don\u2019t know if the data he used represents a random selection of the general population. In his Substack post, Kirsch asserted that whether someone is in the pay-per-dose program is \u201cpretty random\u201d, but this is an assumption that Kirsch didn\u2019t test or demonstrate to be true. Secondly, by Kirsch\u2019s own admission, the data wasn\u2019t complete. On Substack, he wrote that \u201cMany people will not have all their doses in this database, e.g., there may just be dose 3 data for someone\u201d. This means we don\u2019t have a full picture of vaccination outcomes for every individual with records in the pay-per-dose data, which makes it even more difficult to calculate an accurate mortality rate in this population. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and editor at Science-Based Medicine, who discussed Kirsch\u2019s analysis at length in this article, countered that: \u201c[I]f you are going to assert that, for purposes of your analysis, incomplete records and uneven sampling in the dataset don\u2019t matter, you really do need to show the receipts and mathematically prove that these deficiencies in the dataset don\u2019t affect the results of your analysis.\u201d In particular, he highlighted how epidemiologists would test their data using multiple approaches in order to determine if the assumptions used in their analyses are sound (also called sensitivity analysis). Thirdly, the data contained no information on mortality in unvaccinated people. Kirsch also didn\u2019t compare mortality rate with that of the pre-pandemic baseline. Without this information, it\u2019s impossible to establish whether the mortality rate in vaccinated people is actually different from that of unvaccinated people. Fourthly, Kirsch\u2019s analysis emphasized deaths in the elderly, glossing over some important mortality trends in New Zealand over the past three years, which we discuss in the next section. Rise in mortality in older age groups is most likely due to a return to baseline mortality, not excess mortality caused by vaccines Jeffrey Morris, biostatistician and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was among the experts who analyzed Kirsch\u2019s claims. On X\/Twitter, he pointed out that the rise in mortality Kirsch observed in the months after vaccination was only present in senior citizens, but not in children or younger adults. However, Kirsch\u2019s choice to show only deaths in those aged 60 and above and the all-ages mortality\u2014with the latter primarily representing deaths in the elderly\u2014obscured this fact. This left one with the impression that this rise in mortality occurred across the entire population, when this only affected the elderly. New Zealand\u2019s official data agency, Stats NZ, reported in February 2023 that: \u201cDeaths are gradually increasing over time, despite a generally increasing life expectancy. This is because of population growth, and more people in older ages where most deaths occur. Four out of every five deaths in 2022 were to people aged 65 years and older, and just over half (53 percent) were to those 80 years and older. The number of people in the population reaching these older ages is increasing, which will therefore increase the number of deaths occurring\u201d. Health Feedback also obtained population mortality data from Stats NZ\u2019s Infoshare website, which provides this data stratified by age (see Figure 1 below). The data show that in groups below the age of 60, there was no substantial change in mortality rate between 2020 and 2022. This is sufficient to refute the implication that COVID-19 vaccines have caused widespread deaths across New Zealand\u2019s entire population. Figure 1 \u2013 Age-specific mortality rates for groups aged 59 and below (A) and groups aged 60 and above (B). Note that the mortality rates for those below 60 are substantially lower than those aged 60 and above; the maximum value for the y-axis (that is needed to display data fully) in A is five, but 300 in B. Additionally, the y-axis interval in A is one, but 50 in B. Mortality rates in A show no significant increase between 2020 and 2022, but increases can be seen in B, particularly for those 80 years old and above. Source: Stats NZ Infoshare. The next question is why mortality in elderly groups has risen and whether this could be plausibly attributed to COVID-19 vaccines. To answer this question, we need to account for the fact that New Zealand actually experienced negative excess mortality in the first two years of the pandemic (see Figure 2 below), meaning that there were fewer deaths compared to the historical baseline, unlike most other countries during the pandemic. This has been attributed to New Zealand\u2019s strict elimination policy, enacted in 2020 and 2021. Figure 2 \u2013 Excess mortality in New Zealand from March 2020 to October 2023. Note the large negative excess mortality spanning from March 2020 to around early 2023. Source: Our World in Data. In October 2021, New Zealand switched to a mitigation policy and relaxed restrictions. This was followed by the introduction of the Omicron variant into the country, which led to a wave of infections in early 2022 (see Figure 3 below). By comparing Figures 2 and 3, we can see that the rise in mortality in New Zealand corresponds to the wave of COVID-19. Figure 3 \u2013 Confirmed new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand from March 2021 to October 2023. Note the spike in COVID-19 cases beginning around March 2022. Source: Our World in Data. A letter to The Lancet, in which scientists from the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand analyzed weekly all-cause mortality in 2020, 2021, and 2022[1]. They found that: \u201cIn 2020, there was a negative excess mortality with 439.4 fewer deaths per million, potentially due to several factors including the elimination of COVID-19, markedly reduced burden of influenza and other respiratory viruses, and fewer deaths from road traffic accidents, occupational causes, air pollution, and post-surgical complications.\u201d 2021 also saw negative excess mortality, with less than a quarter of the population diagnosed with COVID-19, and \u201cweekly mortality rates fluctuated around the historical mean with a negative excess mortality of 7\u00b76 fewer deaths per million population\u201d. By early 2022, 93% of the eligible population in New Zealand had already been fully vaccinated. However, a relaxing of restrictions came hand in hand with the spread of Omicron, leading to \u201cexcess mortality of 662.4 deaths per million population, predominantly due to COVID-19-attributable deaths.\u201d When all of these data and findings are taken together, it suggests that the huge negative excess mortality was due to COVID-19 restrictions, which have since been lifted. And with the lifting of restrictions, deaths due to causes like flu and other respiratory viruses, as well as other causes like car accidents, have made their return. Therefore, the later rise in mortality in the elderly that Kirsch observed very likely represents a return to baseline mortality, rather than excess mortality caused by the vaccines, Morris pointed out in an exchange with Gorski. In a separate thread on X\/Twitter, Morris emphasized the importance of considering multiple potential explanations for a certain observation, due to confounding factors and bias inherent to observational data: \u201cAs I would emphasize, any genuine attempt to assess potential causal effects of vaccines requires consideration of controls and adjust for confounding and other sources of bias inherent to these observational data in the pandemic (as may published studies do), but it might be useful for some to consider looking at these data as a basic plausibility filter for assessing whether they think the excess deaths are primarily driven by vaccination or by covid.\u201d Published studies in the U.S. and Hungary haven\u2019t found COVID-19 vaccination to be associated with a greater risk in mortality[2-4]. The observation that there was negative excess mortality in 2021, coupled with the fact that more than 90% of those eligible for the vaccine had already received at least one dose in 2021, means that Kirsch\u2019s claim simply doesn\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. If COVID-19 vaccines were as deadly as Kirsch claimed, with a mortality rate of one in a thousand vaccinated people, then we would have seen this manifest as excess mortality in 2021. A similar claim related to the New Zealand dataset, made by the X\/Twitter account Leading Report which we investigated, is that it showed 20% of New Zealanders died from the COVID-19 vaccines. USA Today covered this claim in a fact-check, speaking to experts who explained the math simply didn\u2019t add up: \u201cNearly 4 million people in New Zealand have received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as of Dec. 1, according to public health agency Te Whatu Ora. For the claim to be true, at least 800,000 of those vaccinated people would have had to have died. But from the start of 2020 through June 2023, there were about 125,000 total deaths attributed to all causes, according to Statistics New Zealand, the country\u2019s government data agency.\u201d Kirsch told USA Today that he stood by his analysis. Conclusion Kirsch\u2019s analysis of a subset of New Zealand vaccination data is methodologically flawed and makes unjustified assumptions about the data, such as by claiming the data represent a random sample, when no evidence was provided to show this was the case. It also cherry-picked the data it presented, implying that the rise in mortality seen in the elderly also applied to other age groups. In fact, this rise was limited to the elderly; no significant changes in mortality in children and younger adults occurred in New Zealand between 2020 and 2022. New Zealand\u2019s strict elimination policy during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic produced a huge negative excess mortality, as it didn\u2019t only minimize COVID-19 deaths, but also reduced deaths from causes like respiratory illnesses, traffic accidents, and surgical complications. This policy later shifted to a more relaxed mitigation policy. This also meant that the causes of death diminished by COVID-19 restrictions made a comeback, in tandem with a rise in mortality rate in the elderly. While this rise is genuine, it doesn\u2019t represent excess mortality from vaccines as some have claimed, but a return to baseline mortality. Correction (11 December 2023): The review initially wrote that the name of the individual charged with accessing the New Zealand database for dishonest purposes was Barry White. This is incorrect. It should be Barry Young. We have corrected this error. REFERENCES",

Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias\/Fact Check. Herd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: \u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d The headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.] Marm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated. Kilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population. \u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d The article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population. \u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d In short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded. Apart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity. Tara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2]. Virologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread: No, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https:\/\/t.co\/xkAQKU1hg6 \u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity \u20142\/3 of the US population has not had covid \u2014Wrong on T-cell protection \u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective \u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com\/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021 William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading. \u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said. As reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d Curiously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection. One reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor. \u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said. Cases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed. In summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave. While the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants. Masks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7\/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021 Former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d You can read the original Wall Street Journal article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK A. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz: The article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent). 1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence. 2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. Using the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%\/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims. Thus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data. Tara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University: There are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2]. William Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health: This is not an exhaustive list. The estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500\/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000\/million in Virginia, and about 300\/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing. There are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection. The article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7]. Finally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination. REFERENCES",

        "title":"Coughing: Is It COVID-19, Flu, Cold, RSV, or Allergies?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/covid-cough-vs-normal-cough",
        "text":"A cough is one of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19. But a cough is also a typical symptom of many other conditions, including the flu, the common cold, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and seasonal allergies. If you\u2019re coughing, you may wonder how you can tell whether it\u2019s due to COVID-19 or a different condition. This article will look at some ways you may be able to tell the difference. What does COVID-19 cough feel and sound like? Research published in 2021 tried to study the sounds a person makes to determine whether they can detect COVID-19 via cough. They were able to tell the difference between a person who coughs to, for example, clear their throat versus someone who coughs because they have an illness. But there isn\u2019t a way to definitively diagnose COVID-19 by cough sound detection, according to a 2022 study. About two-thirds of coughs related to COVID-19 are dry coughs that don\u2019t produce mucus. This means that most coughs are going to be dry and hacking. With dry cough, it\u2019s often hard to stop coughing once you start. Still, you may sometimes cough up mucus when you have COVID-19. These characteristics differ from a \u201cnormal\u201d cough, where your body is trying to get rid of some kind of irritant. Such coughs are usually self-limiting and won\u2019t continue throughout the day. Can an app detect COVID-19 cough? New artificial intelligence (AI) technology may be able to distinguish COVID-19 cough from other types of cough, according to 2020 research . Users of an AI app can submit cough sounds, which the app compares to a large database. Results are available within 2 minutes. While this tool can\u2019t make a clinical diagnosis, it can help people and doctors more effectively screen for COVID-19. Clinical trials are underway to help develop this technology. Was this helpful? Quiz: How can I tell if my cough is due to COVID-19 or something else? It\u2019s difficult to tell by listening to your cough whether you have COVID-19 or something else. But COVID-19 is often accompanied by other hallmark symptoms. The following chart breaks down some common symptoms of conditions that may cause you to cough. This chart may help you if you\u2019re trying to determine whether your cough is due to COVID-19. Cold Flu Allergies RSV COVID-19 Onset 1\u20133 days after exposure 1\u20134 days after exposure depends on the season 4\u20136 days after exposure 2\u201314 days after exposure Fever rare common no common common Cough mild common sometimes common usually dry Nausea\/Diarrhea no sometimes no no sometimes Additional symptoms sneezing, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose fatigue, body aches, and headaches sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache body aches, fatigue, and loss of smell or taste The most definitive way you\u2019ll be able to tell is through testing. You can use tests that determine whether you have COVID-19, the flu, or both \u2014 and yes, you can get both COVID-19 and the flu, or another virus, at the same time. You can also be tested for RSV with a rapid diagnostic test using a nasal swab. While no specific tests exist for the common cold, they can sometimes help you rule out other conditions. If a healthcare professional rules out COVID-19, RSV, and flu, a cold could be a likely cause of your cough. Colds also tend not to last as long as the flu, RSV, or COVID-19. What is the treatment for COVID-19 cough? If you have a cough related to COVID-19, you may experience chest discomfort and interrupted sleep \u2014 a concern when you\u2019re trying to rest and recover. Some methods you can use to specifically address your cough include: Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. This helps to keep your throat moist and reduces irritation. Use a cool mist humidifier if the air in your home is very dry. You can also take a hot shower with the door closed to generate plenty of steam. Consume cold or hot foods, like popsicles, warm tea, broth, or ice chips. These can all soothe irritated throats and reduce coughing. Consider over-the-counter (OTC) cough drops or cough-reducing lollipops. Consume a teaspoon of honey. (Infants younger than 1 year old should not consume honey for safety reasons.) Using cough medication can be controversial if you have a wet cough that brings up mucus. If you suppress your cough, you may not get all the mucus up. Instead, you may wish to take a cough expectorant, which helps you cough the mucus up. If you have a dry cough, which is typical with COVID-19, taking cough suppressants can help. Frequently asked questions The following are some frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and coughing. How long does COVID cough last? According to a 2021 study involving people who\u2019d been hospitalized for COVID-19, about 2.5% reported a cough that lasted 11.2 months after hospitalization. While most people\u2019s coughs don\u2019t last quite this long, a 2021 research review found that about 19% of people experience a cough after they\u2019ve gotten over most of the symptoms of COVID-19. Coughing is a reflex that helps clear the airways of mucus, dust, and other irritants. A cough can also be a symptom of irritated airways. Even after recovering from COVID-19, your airways could take a little longer to heal. Does COVID cough get worse at night? Coughs tend to get worse at night for a few reasons. If you have a runny nose, lying flat can worsen postnasal drip. This means the mucus runs down the back of your throat, irritating it and causing you to cough. You may also notice your dry cough is worse at night because you\u2019re usually indoors, where the air tends to be drier and more irritating to your airways. Using a cool mist humidifier may help reduce this occurrence. (But be sure to keep the humidifier clean and dry when not in use). Is coughing up mucus typical in people with COVID-19? According to a 2021 study, about 67% of participants with COVID-19 experienced a dry cough. A dry cough doesn\u2019t bring up mucus. The other 33% report coughing up mucus or phlegm. Can COVID-19 cause you to cough up blood? Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) is a very rare symptom of COVID-19. About 1\u20135% of people with COVID-19 experience this symptom. It\u2019s most common if your infection leads to pneumonia or if you have a pulmonary embolism at the same time, per 2020 research . Hemoptysis can be a medical emergency. If you cough up more than a teaspoon of blood, consider connecting with a healthcare professional as soon as possible.",

        "title":"Long COVID may be one reason for the increase in chronic fatigue syndrome.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health-news\/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cdc-survey",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Health officials suggest that long COVID may be a possible explanation for the recent surge in chronic fatigue cases. Catherine Ledner\/Getty Images A new CDC survey shows around 4.3 million American adults have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Cases of chronic fatigue were more prominent among women than men and in those aged 50\u201369. Health officials suggest that long COVID may be a possible explanation for the recent surge in chronic fatigue cases. To manage chronic fatigue, experts recommend exercising, adopting healthy sleeping habits, and prioritizing their mental health. Until recently, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was considered a rare health condition. Now, a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows approximately 1.3% of adults in the United States have chronic fatigue syndrome. Based on the current U.S. population of 333 million, 1.3% of that figure equates to 4.3 million Americans. The CDC survey included over 57,000 American adults in 2021 and 2022. They were asked if a healthcare professional diagnosed them with chronic fatigue syndrome and if they still have the illness. About 1.3% of participants answered \u201cyes\u201d to both. In addition, the report shows that cases were more prevalent among women compared to men, and in people ages 50\u201369. White adults have a greater risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome compared to Hispanic and Asian adults, according to the survey. Cases of chronic fatigue syndrome were reduced when households had higher incomes and families lived in rural residences. Signs of chronic fatigue syndrome Symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome may include: 6 or more months of severe fatigue paired with a decreased ability to perform daily activities worsening symptoms after physical or mental activity that were not previously an issue difficulty sleeping and feeling fatigued after getting the recommended hours of sleep \u201cNormally, what we see in our clinic are patients who experience very deep fatigue that doesn\u2019t relate to sleep,\u201d said Dr. Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology with UTHealth Houston and Memorial Hermann. Ostrosky-Zeichner wasn\u2019t involved in the survey. \u201cIt waxes and wanes, meaning they may feel better for a while, but when they engage in extra activity they feel overexerted.\u201d This type of overexertion is known as post-exertional malaise . In most cases, symptoms worsen 12\u201348 hours after activity and can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. \u201cChronic fatigue syndrome is a clinical diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Surendra Barshikar, director of the COVID Recover Clinic at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained. Barshikar wasn\u2019t involved in the survey. \u201cThe main symptoms are fatigue that impairs function and is present for more than six months, severe post exertional malaise and moderate to severe unrefreshing sleep. Most patients also report either orthostatic intolerance or moderate to severe cognitive impairment,\u201d he told Healthline. What\u2019s the link between COVID and chronic fatigue? \u201cIt\u2019s typical to see CFS 4\u20136 months after Covid,\u201d Ostrosky-Zeichner said. \u201cTo find out if a patient has chronic fatigue syndrome, it\u2019s a diagnosis of exclusion.\u201d Ostrosky-Zeichner said he would first rule out any acute complications and damage from COVID in his patients before making a long COVID diagnosis. He explained that some people may experience heart or lung damage from COVID, while others may have underlying health conditions exacerbated by the virus. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t find anything, we conclude it\u2019s long COVID,\u201d Ostrosky-Zeichner said. Barshikar explained the cause of long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome \u201cinvolves a triggering challenge to the immune system from the viral infection.\u201d He noted that both conditions are common in females. \u201cAll the symptoms that are seen in CFS are commonly seen in long COVID,\u201d Barshikar said, adding that symptoms may include: fatigue brain fog impaired sleep orthostatic intolerance (inability to remain upright) Treating fatigue in long COVID requires ruling out other common causes of fatigue. According to Barshikar, these may include: hormonal imbalance electrolyte imbalance anemia poor quality sleep certain mental health issues \u201cDetailed history and time sequence of events is important. We can assume that long COVID is causing the fatigue if other causes are ruled out and history clearly suggests that symptoms started post COVID, Barshikar said.\u201d How is chronic fatigue syndrome treated? Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can be beneficial for treating chronic fatigue. \u201cOne of the best ways to get rid of fatigue is through exercise so you don\u2019t experience post-exertional malaise,\u201d said Ostrosky-Zeichner. \u201cHowever, it has to be the right amount of activity to build up your tolerance.\u201d Sleep hygiene is also important. \u201cGetting better sleep and creating better sleep environments can help manage CFS,\u201d he noted. Another factor to take into consideration is mental health. \u201cAddressing the mental health component of CFS is important. If a patient has anxiety, depression or PTSD, it can play a role in how often and how severely they experience fatigue,\u201d Ostrosky-Zeichner explained. Regarding pharmacological agents, \u201csome medications can stimulate your attention and system overall and block hormones that are related to fatigue,\u201d he added. However, as with any medication, consult with a healthcare professional beforehand. But \u201cthere is no specific single treatment,\u201d Barshikar said. \u201cIt is important to manage sleep, nutrition, hydration and physical activity in chronic fatigue. Patients with severe fatigue and PEM [post exertional malaise] are told to plan, prioritize, prevent and pace to minimize symptoms. Certain medications like stimulants can be tried but are not typically approved or always beneficial.\u201d Barshikar noted.",

Thousands of people have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (>500,000 infected) and many deaths (>25,000) resulting from COVID-19, particularly older people with chronic diseases (including cardiovascular and diabetes) and cancer. COVID-19 highlighted the weakness of health systems in several locations, including those with strong welfare systems (e.g. Europe and USA). The speed of the transmission and the high frequency of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring subintensive and intensive care units (ICU) demonstrated the inadequacy of their preparedness to deal with acute epidemic diseases. The fast track solution was to re-introduce the battle-field war strategies: the triage to decide those to be treated, based on age (in some Italian hospital the older people admitted were 55-year old) or on health (in USA disabilities are considered as selection criteria). At the same time we had few very encouraging positive findings: The capacity to establish in 10 days hospitals and shelters for the care of thousands of patients, even at intensive and sub-intensive level The potential to develop preventive vaccines in few months, the General Scientist Dr Chen Wei, produced the vaccine and tested it on her arm on March 5th The discovery of the efficacy of anti-IL6-IL6R axis to solve ARDS and to drastically reduce or even prevent ICU stay.

        "text":"The Covid 19 pandemic has dominated global life, death and public interest. However, the crucial problem of breast cancer continues. A new review, Catching Viral Breast Cancer , explores the probable viral origins of breast cancer. James Lawson, senior author of the review, and Generoso Bevilacqua of Pisa, Italy, a leading researcher into the origins of breast cancer, join us in a discussion about breast cancer. Image by marijana1 from Pixabay James Lawson (JL) is from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia where he established the Public Health Program. Together with his colleague Wendy Glenn and their international collaborators including Generoso Bevilacqua of Pisa and Beatriz Pogo of New York, for the past 20 years they have been investigating the viral origins of breast cancer. James has only one wife but 25 grandchildren all of whom live in Australia. Generoso Bevilacqua (GB) served at the University of Pisa as Professor of Pathology and director of Pathology, of the PhD Course in Experimental Oncology, and of the Department of Laboratory Medicine. While at the NCI, NIH, Bethesda MD, he co-authored the discovery of the NM23 gene, the first gene with an inhibitory role in the metastasis process. His laboratory was the first one in Italy and one of the first in Europe to develop molecular pathology and the study of hereditary breast\/ovarian cancer. He was co-founder and then chairman of the Group for Molecular Pathology of the European Society of Pathology. He directed national projects on molecular diagnostics and on hereditary breast\/ovarian tumors of the National Research Council (CNR), the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC), the Ministry of Health. He founded the Center for Hereditary Tumors of the Pisa University Hospital. He studies MMTV since the \u201870s and the possible causative role of MMTV\/HBRV in human breast carcinogenesis for about 15 years. His demonstration of MMTV-like exogenous sequences in the dental calculus of individuals from the Copper Age and in human saliva helped develop the concept of the existence of HBRV, the first human betaretrovirus, present among us for thousands of years and possibly able to give origin to both neoplastic and infectious diseases. Why is breast cancer of such concern? JL \u2013 One in eight Western women will develop breast cancer. Most are older women but one in four are below the age of 50 many of whom have dependent children. GB \u2013 First of all because breast cancer is a leading cause of premature death among women; when hereditary, it affects patients younger than 40 years, even at 18, 20. Moreover, the patient is affected in two very important aspects of her intimate life, breast feeding and sexuality. Breast has a special place in the collective imagination. Why is finding the cause of breast cancer important? JL \u2013 Despite much progress in early detection and treatment, mortality is still very high. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2021 in USA the expected new cases of invasive breast carcinoma are 284,200 with 44,130 expected deaths. GB \u2013 I agree. Why is finding the cause so difficult? JL \u2013 Good question! Generoso is better able to answer than me. GB \u2013 Human breast carcinoma is divided into two wide groups, sporadic and hereditary, each characterized by distinctly different biomolecular pathways and clinical behavior. Hereditary tumors represent 5-10% of all cases, maybe more, and are induced by highly penetrant pathogenic mutations, transmitted in an autosomal dominant way from one parent. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 80-90% of cases. For what concerns sporadic cases, whereas their pathogenesis is known in details (estrogens are the main promoting factor), their etiology remains unknown. By the way, sporadic means random, just to indicate the current lack of specific causes. This means that we don\u2019t know the cause of 80-90% of all cases of breast cancer. All risk factors known concern the pathogenesis of disease, not its etiology. For example, obesity is a risk factor because adipose tissue is an important source of estrogens. On the other hand, since almost one century scientists study an animal model of mammary tumors induced in mouse by the betaretrovirus Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus \u2013 MMTV. This model inspired many studies on human breast cancer and has been very useful to clarify several aspects of human cancer biology, such as the concept of cancer progression, the recognition of the preinvasive lesions and the promotional role of estrogens. Since the \u201870s, scientists try to demonstrate that MMTV is the cause of human breast cancer and in recent years data in this direction became more and more numerous. Recent studies on ancient human remnants found in Italy and on saliva of healthy people and breast cancer patients demonstrate the existence of a human betaretrovirus highly homologous to MMTV, now known as HBRV \u2013 human betaretrovirus. And the presence of viral sequences in human saliva indicates a possible inter-human diffusion by microdroplets. Why could it not be shown that MMTV was a cause of human breast cancer? GB \u2013 The hypothesis of a viral etiology for breast cancer goes back to the \u201870s, but only in the \u201890s the modern molecular technology allowed Beatriz Pogo and her colleagues to find MMTV sequences in human tumors. In the last almost 30 years many data confirming these observations accumulated, together with important biological data such as the demonstration that the virus can infect human breast cells. Interestingly, MMTV, now HBRV, has been shown in normal breast tissues years before the development of breast cancer and it was found absent in hereditary breast carcinomas, that, as seen above, have a specific etio-pathogenesis and do not need a virus for their development. Why does MMTV cause breast cancer in women but rarely in men? JL \u2013 Because men do not have enough estrogens to promote the growth of cells eventually transformed. Moreover, we have to consider that tumors of the male breast are almost all hereditary. They represent only one per cent of all breast cancers. Why does MMTV cause cancer mainly in the breast and not other tissues? JL \u2013 While MMTV is found in 40% of invasive breast cancers and in 80% of carcinoma in situ, it has also been identified in cancers of the uterus, prostate, ovaries and even skin. This suggests that MMTV can cause cancer in tissues influenced by sex hormones, as well demonstrated by the animal studies. Is MMTV\/HBRV involved also in non neoplastic diseases? JL \u2013 Affirmative. Andrew Mason in Canada published several interesting papers linking the virus to a chronic inflammatory disease of liver, primary biliary cholangitis. He is also tempting a therapeutic approach to this disease (Lytvyak E \u2026. Mason AL, Liver Int. 2021; 41(8):1879). GB \u2013 These data strengthen our convincement that MMTV\/HBRV is a human virus, by now well diffuse in the world, able to induce cancer and inflammatory disease. We note that in their Review James Lawson and Wendy Glenn consider additional viruses which also have roles in human breast cancer. What are these viruses and are they also sex hormone dependent? JL \u2013 The additional viruses are human papilloma virus (the cause of cervical cancer), Epstein Barr virus (the cause of some lymphomas) and bovine leukemia virus (the cause of cancer in cattle). While these viruses probably are also influenced by hormones, it seems they are less dependent on hormones than MMTV. These viruses are present in breast cancer much more commonly than normal breast controls. While the detail is missing, it appears these viruses can interact with MMTV to cause breast cancer. How can this new knowledge about viruses and breast cancer be used to treat and prevent human breast cancer? JL \u2013 To discover the viral etiology of a disease open to the possibility to prevent it by vaccination. This strategy can be applied to tumors too, as demonstrated by the realization of safe and effective vaccines (Gardosil) in use to prevent infections by human papilloma viruses. The spread of bovine leukemia virus can be controlled by removal (culling\/killing) infected cattle (this has already been achieved in Australia and several European countries). Experiments on experimental mice have shown that effective vaccines against MMTV are possible. It is proving very difficult to develop vaccines against Epstein Barr virus. GB \u2013 Our colleagues in Israel have shown that it may be possible to develop vaccines against MMTV using recently developed protein based techniques. You have both substantially contributed to this field of research. How do you feel about your work? JL \u2013 We are very pleased. I just wish I was young again and able to see the outcomes of all our work. GB \u2013 I am also pleased, especially on behalf of my 4,500 year old ancestors",

        "text":"A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts. Most people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later. But even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations. \"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. More COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science How Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19 Fighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease Disgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working? How the immune system remembers COVID-19 There are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time. New research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease. \"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\" In a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die. Image Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article. While the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. \"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past. \"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. \"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature If it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. \"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. COVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. \"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. \"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",

        "text":"Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic. Joel Shurkin, Contributor (Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe. The Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S. Italy\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone. In a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum. The pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy. Italians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified. About three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region. As of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died. In mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone. Ventilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques. In one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing. Fifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment. The use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die. Triage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited. What the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention. \u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d One way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines. The allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better. In American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan. Researchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision. Who is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician. These kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world. Yet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel. American doctors will likely face the same agonizing choices that have been necessary in other countries facing the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of educational webinars with residents, medical students, staff, ICU directors,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going on everywhere around the country. I know many hospitals are scrambling to put together policies and committees. I think we're a little ahead of the game at NYU, partly because we\u2019re a hospital of last resort. \u201cI don\u2019t think any hospital is fully prepared. I think planning was just inadequate.\u201d Spain is now catching up to Italy with cases. \u201cAnd so,\" Cereda said, \u201care we.\u201d",

        "text":"The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past. A German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system. Next week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic. Discovering antibodies Emil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin. Von Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production. \"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908. Image Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory. Media credits The Wellcome Collection Media rights CC BY 4.0 Von Behring and Ehrlich's anti-diphtheria serum, known as diphtheria antitoxin, is essentially the same idea as the convalescent plasma being explored as a treatment for Covid-19. The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans. \"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization. While diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand. After developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies. Von Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19. Antibodies as tools Antibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body. But many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products. C\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984. \"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.) Many new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals. Researchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways. Killer T cells While antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells. Viruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target. \"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\" Image A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0 By the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty. With colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body. When a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells. Doherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19. \"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\" Most vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place. But respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems. If a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms. There is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses. There are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat. \"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\"",

In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article. While the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. \"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past. \"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. \"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature If it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. \"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. COVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. \"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. \"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",

        "text":"Most comprehensive global study\u2014analysing 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories\u2014reveals how well the world\u2019s population were prepared in terms of underlying health for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global crisis of chronic diseases and failure of public health to stem the rise in highly preventable risk factors have left populations vulnerable to acute health emergencies such as COVID-19. Urgent action is needed to address the global syndemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities, and COVID-19 to ensure more robust health systems and healthier people, making countries more resilient to future pandemic threats. The Global Burden of Disease Study provides a roadmap to where need is greatest, with country-specific data on risk factors and chronic disease burden. The interaction of COVID-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illness and related risk factors, including obesity, high blood sugar, and outdoor air pollution, over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling COVID-19 deaths. The latest findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) [1], published today in The Lancet, provide new insights on how well countries were prepared in terms of underlying health for the COVID-19 pandemic, and set out the true scale of the challenge to protect against further pandemic threats. The study also reveals that the rise in exposure to key risk factors (including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high body-mass index [BMI], and elevated cholesterol), combined with rising deaths from cardiovascular disease in some countries (e.g., the USA and the Caribbean), suggests that the world might be approaching a turning point in life expectancy gains. The authors stress that the promise of disease prevention through government actions or incentives that enable healthier behaviours and access to health-care resources is not being realised around the world. \u201cMost of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits. We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research\u201d, says Professor Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, USA, who led the research [2]. Several of the risk factors and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) highlighted by the study, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are associated with increased risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19. But diseases don\u2019t just interact biologically, they also interact with social factors. Urgent action is needed to address the syndemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities, and COVID-19\u2014referring to the interaction of several epidemics that exacerbate the disease burden in populations who are already burdened, and increase their vulnerability. Dr Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, says: \u201cThe syndemic nature of the threat we face demands that we not only treat each affliction, but also urgently address the underlying social inequalities that shape them\u2014poverty, housing, education, and race, which are all powerful determinants of health.\u201d He continues, \u201cCOVID-19 is an acute-on-chronic health emergency. And the chronicity of the present crisis is being ignored at our future peril. Non-communicable diseases have played a critical role in driving the more than 1 million deaths caused by COVID-19 to date, and will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides. As we address how to regenerate our health systems in the wake of COVID-19, this Global Burden of Disease Study offers a means of targeting where the need is greatest, and how it differs between countries\u201d [2]. Health systems ill-prepared for rapid rise in NCDs and disabilities Although global healthy life expectancy\u2014the number of years a person can expect to have good health\u2014has increased steadily (by over 6.5 years) between 1990 and 2019, it has not risen as much as overall life expectancy in 198 of the 204 countries assessed, indicating that people are living more years in poor health [3]. Disability, rather than early death, has become an increasingly large share of the global disease burden\u2014rising from around a fifth (21%) of total burden in 1990 to more than a third (34%) in 2019. In 11 countries, more than half of all health loss (measured by disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] [4]) is now due to disability caused by NCDs and injuries\u2014including in Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Qatar. Global health efforts to tackle infectious diseases and address prenatal care have been successful in improving the health of children aged under 10 years in the past few decades (with the overall disease burden declining by approximately 55%), but this has not been matched by a similar response in older age groups. The top ten contributors to increasing health loss worldwide over the past 30 years, measured as the largest absolute increases in number of DALYs, include six causes that largely affect older adults\u2014ischaemic heart disease (with numbers of related DALYs increasing by 50% between 1990 and 2019), diabetes (up 148%), stroke (32%), chronic kidney disease (93%), lung cancer (69%), and age-related hearing loss (83%). In addition, four causes are common from teenage years into old age\u2014HIV\/AIDS (128%), musculoskeletal disorders (129%), low back pain (47%), and depressive disorders (61%). For example, from 1990 to 2019, the number of DALYs due to ischaemic heart disease rose by more than 400% in the Philippines, while the number of DALYs due to diabetes rose by more than 1000% in the United Arab Emirates. Such increases in ill health threaten to strain health-care systems ill-equipped to handle the chronic conditions associated with growing, ageing populations. In 2019, the leading causes of health loss differed substantially across age groups. Road injuries, headache disorders, HIV\/AIDS, low back pain, and depressive disorders were the dominant health problems in younger people aged 10\u201349 years old. In contrast, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were the major contributors to health loss in people aged 50 and older. Over the past decade, global progress on health has been uneven. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have made impressive gains in health, largely as a result of successful efforts against infectious, maternal, and neonatal diseases. For example, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Bangladesh have seen 2% or greater yearly reductions in age-standardised rates of health loss (DALYs). But the authors warn that LMICs\u2019 health systems are not well equipped to address the growing disease burden caused by NCDs\u2014which has risen among lower-middle-income countries from around a third of the overall disease burden in 1990 to nearly two-thirds in 2019. Further, while deaths due to infectious diseases have fallen substantially across LMICs, NCD deaths are on the rise. In Uzbekistan, for example, diabetes has risen from the 21st to the fifth leading cause of death (a 600% increase in the number of deaths). Likewise, in the Philippines, ischaemic heart disease has risen from the fifth to the leading cause of death (a more than 350% increase). In contrast, improvements in health have started to stagnate in most higher-income countries, and have even reversed in several countries, particularly the USA, where the age-standardised rate of health loss has increased by nearly 3% over the past decade. The authors believe the reasons for this lack of progress might include rising rates of obesity as well as diminishing potential to reduce smoking and to make further improvements in coverage of treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which will be necessary to maintain declines in cardiovascular deaths. \u201cAs disability becomes an increasingly large share of the global disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, there is an urgent and compelling need to identify new, more effective interventions\u201d, says Murray. \u201cWith a rapidly ageing global population, demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes and chronic conditions, which increase with age, will demand greater levels of funding, strong political commitment, accountability supported by better data, and a coordinated global effort that prioritises the most vulnerable\u201d [2] Failure of public health to stem rise in critical risk factors Over the past decade, there have been particularly large and concerning increases (over 0.5% per year globally) in exposure to several highly preventable risks\u2014obesity, high blood sugar, alcohol use, and drug use\u2014which are contributing to the growing burden of NCDs, and highlight the critical need for stronger public health efforts. The greatest cumulative impact on health comes from the striking rise in metabolic risks, which have risen 1.5% a year since 2010. Collectively, metabolic risks (namely high BMI, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol) accounted for nearly 20% of total health loss worldwide in 2019\u2014 50% higher than in 1990 (10.4%). They are also responsible for a huge number of deaths globally\u2014with high blood pressure contributing to 1 in 5 deaths (almost 11 million) in 2019, high blood sugar (6.5 million deaths), high BMI (5 million), and high cholesterol (4.4 million). Among the major NCD risks, only smoking has declined substantially. Major efforts to implement international tobacco control policies have seen exposure to smoking fall by nearly 10% worldwide since 2010, although tobacco (smoked, secondhand, and chewing) remains the leading cause of death in many high-income countries, including the USA, Canada, the UK, Japan, Belgium, and Denmark in 2019; and claimed nearly 9 million lives worldwide. The impact of risk factors also varies widely across regions. In much of Latin America, Asia, and Europe, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high BMI, and tobacco use are key contributors to poor health. In Oceania, malnutrition and air pollution are among the leading risks. The most marked differences are in sub-Saharan Africa, which, unlike other regions, is dominated by malnutrition; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; air pollution; and unsafe sex (appendix 2, figure S3). \u201cSimply providing information on the harms of these risks is not enough\u201d, said co-author Professor Emmanuela Gakidou from IHME. \u201cGiven that individual choices are influenced by financial considerations, education, and the availability of alternatives, governments should collaborate globally on initiatives to make healthier behaviour possible for everyone. And, drawing lessons from decades of tobacco control, when there is a major risk to population health, such as obesity, concerted government action through regulation, taxation, and subsidies may be required\u201d [2]. Findings highlight need to tackle wider determinants of health Since 2000, there has been stronger progress in less developed countries than those at the highest level of development\u2014fuelling faster gains in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy through efforts to increase income, provide more years of education, and support family planning. The authors stress that there is now overdue recognition of how important social and economic development is to overall health, and the need for a much broader approach that pays more attention to all the drivers of population health. \u201cGiven the overwhelming impact of social and economic development on health progress, doubling down on policies and strategies that stimulate economic growth, expand access to schooling, and improve the status of women, should be our collective priority\u201d, says Murray. [2] An accompanying Editorial from The Lancet states, \"Although attention should be given to controlling community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and protecting those most vulnerable to its consequences, success will require a more capacious strategy. COVID-19 is a syndemic of coronavirus infection combined with an epidemic of non-communicable diseases, both inter- acting on a social substrate of poverty and inequality. The message of GBD is that unless deeply embedded structural inequities in society are tackled and unless a more liberal approach to immigration policies is adopted, communities will not be protected from future infectious outbreaks and population health will not achieve the gains that global health advocates seek. It's time for the global health community to change direction.\" NOTES TO EDITORS The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

        "title":"New evidence on natural immunity protection by COVID-19 variant and how protection fades over time",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.healthdata.org\/news-events\/newsroom\/news-releases\/lancet-most-comprehensive-study-date-provides-evidence-natural",
        "text":"Largest review and meta-analysis assessing the extent of protection following COVID-19 infection by variant and how durable that protection is against different variants, including 65 studies from 19 countries . For people who have been infected with COVID-19 at least once before, natural immunity against severe disease (hospitalisation and death) was strong and long-lasting for all variants (88% or greater at 10 months post infection). Past infection with pre-Omicron variants provided substantially reduced natural immunity protection against reinfection with Omicron BA.1 (36% at 10 months after infection) . The researchers say we should recognise the natural immunity in people who have recently been infected with COVID-19 , but warn that their findings should not discourage vaccination because it is the safest way to acquire immunity. For someone previously infected with COVID-19, their risk of hospitalization or death is 88% lower for at least 10 months compared to those who had not been previously infected, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet. The analysis also suggests that the level and duration of protection against reinfection, symptomatic disease and severe illness is at least on a par with that provided by two doses of the mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNtech) for ancestral, Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. The study did not include data on infection from Omicron XBB and its sublineages. \u201cVaccination is the safest way to acquire immunity, whereas acquiring natural immunity must be weighed against the risks of severe illness and death associated with the initial infection,\u201d says lead author Dr Stephen Lim from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine, USA. [1] As IHME co-author Dr Caroline Stein explains: \u201cVaccines continue to be important for everyone in order to protect high-risk populations such as those who are over 60 years of age and those with comorbidities. This also includes populations that have not previously been infected and unvaccinated groups, as well as those who were infected or received their last vaccine dose more than six months ago. Decision makers should take both natural immunity and vaccination status into consideration to obtain a full picture of an individual\u2019s immunity profile.\u201d [1] Since January 2021, several studies and reviews have reported the effectiveness of past COVID-19 infection in reducing the risk of reinfection and how immunity wanes over time. But none has comprehensively assessed how long the protection after natural infection will last and how durable that protection will be against different variants. To provide more evidence, the researchers conducted a review and meta-analysis of all previous studies that compared the reduction in risk of COVID-19 among non-vaccinated individuals against a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection to non-vaccinated individuals without a previous infection up to September 2022. It included 65 studies from 19 countries [2] and evaluates the effectiveness of past infection by outcome (infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease), variant, and time since infection. Studies examining natural immunity in combination with vaccination (i.e., hybrid immunity) were excluded from the analyses. Immunity fades over time Analysis of data from 21 studies reporting on time since infection from a pre-Omicron variant estimated that protection against reinfection from a pre-Omicron variant was about 85% at one month\u2014and this fell to about 79% at 10 months. Protection from a pre-Omicron variant infection against reinfection from the Omicron BA.1 variant was lower (74% at one month) and declined more rapidly to 36% at around 10 months. Nevertheless, analysis of five studies reporting on severe disease (hospitalisation and death) found that protection remained universally high for 10 months: 90% for ancestral, Alpha, and Delta, and 88% for Omicron BA.1. Six studies evaluating protection against Omicron sub-lineages specifically (BA.2 and BA.4\/BA.5) suggested significantly reduced protection when the prior infection was pre-Omicron variant. But when the past infection was Omicron, protection was maintained at a higher level. \u201cThe weaker cross-variant immunity with the Omicron variant and its sub-lineages reflects the mutations they have that make them escape built-up immunity more easily than other variants,\u201d says IHME co-author Dr Hasan Nassereldine. \u201cThe limited data we have on natural immunity protection from the Omicron variant and its sub-lineages underscores the importance of continued assessment, particularly since they are estimated to have infected 46% of the global population between November 2021 and June 2022. Further research is also needed to assess the natural immunity of emerging variants and to examine the protection provided by combinations of vaccination and natural infection.\u201d [1] The researchers note some limitations of their study, cautioning that the number of studies examining the Omicron BA.1 variant and its sub-lineages and the number from Africa was generally limited. In addition, only limited data were available beyond 10 months after the initial infection. They also note that some information, such as past infection status and hospital admissions, was measured differently or incomplete, and could bias the estimate of protection. Writing in a linked Comment, Professor Cheryl Cohen, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa, who was not involved in the study, says, \u201cThe high and sustained levels of protection conferred by previous infection against severe disease have important implications for COVID-19 vaccine policy. By September, 2021, global SARS oV-2 seroprevalence was estimated at 59%, with substantial variation in the proportion of immunity induced by infection or vaccination in different settings. Seroprevalence in Africa was estimated at 87% in December, 2021, largely as a result of infection. High levels of immunity are an important contributor to the lower levels of severity observed with infection caused by emerging Omicron subvariants. As SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology shifts to more stable circulation patterns in the context of high levels of immunity, studies of the burden and cost of SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk groups for severe disease are needed to guide rational vaccination policy and decisions around prioritisation in relation to other vaccine preventable diseases.\u201d NOTES TO EDITORS: The study was funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, J.

        "text":"Published: May 24, 2021 Johns Hopkins Medicine is committed to providing vaccine information and access to all personnel From the front lines to behind the scenes, Johns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s diverse group of personnel has worked tirelessly to help inform, treat and protect our patients, visitors and colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic. As essential members of the overall COVID-19 response, the staff members were among the first groups of people eligible to receive the vaccine, and Johns Hopkins quickly mobilized to administer vaccines to those who wanted them. Initially, vaccine supply was extremely limited, and Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) had very little insight about how much it would receive on a weekly basis from the government. Considering these challenges, a methodical approach was taken to provide the vaccine to personnel with the supply available. JHM, through the health care system-wide incident command center, and with the advice of various diversity councils and the scarce allocation committee, has continued to work diligently to reach personnel across their various roles to ensure that they have comprehensive vaccine information and access. MyChart, an electronic health record system, is leveraged. Initially, MyChart was used frequently to inform personnel when new vaccine appointments were available through a ticketing system. Now, with more available vaccine supply, personnel can self-schedule their vaccinations on MyChart. To help encourage the use of MyChart by personnel who don\u2019t have regular email access, MyChart activation and support stations were established in high traffic areas of facilities so that personnel whose work is not computer-based could get help securing appointments. These MyChart activation stations also offered an opportunity to learn more about the various roles colleagues play in this pandemic response, and those who staffed them offered encouragement and comradery. \u201cSome employees didn\u2019t feel they were involved in direct patient care, and therefore shouldn\u2019t get an early vaccine, so we helped them walk through the impact of their day-to-day work,\u201d says Ebony Colina, an Epic applications supervisor and a member of the diversity council. Colina helped staff the MyChart stations. \u201cWe made sure to show everyone that each of us plays an important role that helps support the overall mission of delivering care. You are not \u2018just\u2019 a food services person. You\u2019re an important part of enabling patient care, and every essential role matters.\u201d Johns Hopkins also held COVID-19 Vaccine Employee Zoom Town Halls, featuring Johns Hopkins expert physicians and other leaders. The town halls focused on issues that impact minority populations. Two were conducted in Spanish. Also, videos were created about vaccine equity and COVID-19 disparities, vaccine science and vaccine trial demographics, featuring minority physician leaders to help build trust about the vaccine and address areas of concern. Personnel teams have widely different job responsibilities, from providing care for patients to ensuring the security of facilities and managing food services. Not all employees work behind a computer desk or are comfortable navigating technology. Knowing that personnel receive information in different ways, multiple means of communication were developed \u2014 including signs, infographics, a robust dedicated internal website with easy access to policies, data and guidelines, and other resources to help provide critical information to staff. One-page documents with QR codes that staff members could scan from their mobile devices provided weekly talking points for personnel during their regular shift meetings. \u201cWe are incredibly grateful to our team that has worked tirelessly over the past year in response to the pandemic,\u201d says Gabor Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response. \u201cAnd, we knew we needed to make an assertive effort to help address the issues amongst our personnel that were inhibitory toward being vaccinated, whether based in hesitancy or access. When there\u2019s an entire group of our own personnel that doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t readily use our technology, it\u2019s important to level the playing field and reach out to them in ways that fit within their daily routines.\u201d To help engage staff, Johns Hopkins Medicine connected with the leadership of environmental services, patient transport, food services, security, materials management, facilities, pharmacy, home care and supply chain, and offered leaders information to educate their staff members. Enthusiastic and well-informed personnel were appointed as health advocates and vaccine champions. They helped share messages about vaccine availability and the processes for getting vaccinated, as well as answer questions, during regular shift meetings. As leaders continued to talk to personnel, they heard that it would be helpful for people to see colleagues they know get the vaccine. To accomplish this, and to demonstrate why staff members decided to get vaccinated, photo galleries and videos were developed that gave personnel the opportunity to speak personally and candidly about what the vaccine means to them and why they got vaccinated. The powerful videos were shared across the health care institution. \u201cIt is critical to provide our personnel with up-to-date information, in ways they can access it within in their roles, so they can make an informed choice about their health care options,\u201d says Carole Martens, director of facilities compliance for the health system. \u201cWe remain committed to ensuring that all of our essential team members know what COVID-19 resources, including vaccines, are available to them.\u201d Now that vaccines are more available, Johns Hopkins Medicine is creating pop-up and mobile clinics throughout the Johns Hopkins hospital system to reach personnel who have not received a vaccine. The Turner Auditorium vaccine clinic is also open for walk-in vaccinations on Thursdays and Fridays. Johns Hopkins Medicine is excited to provide lifesaving vaccines to its personnel. And JHM will continue to do everything it can to ensure that those who want a vaccine can get one. All personnel deserve thanks for all they has done for Johns Hopkins\u2019 patients, communities and, importantly, one another as we preserve through this pandemic.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/health\/viruses-infections-disease\/never-before-seen-antibodies-can-target-many-flu-viruses",
        "text":"An illustration of the influenza A virus, showing the key surface proteins, hemagglutinin (in purple) and neuraminidase (in dark pink), that the virus uses to infect cells. (Image credit: selvanegra via Getty Images) A newly discovered class of antibodies in human blood can neutralize different types of the flu virus and could be key to the development of broadly protective vaccines against the seasonal viruses, scientists say. Circulating flu viruses constantly mutate, so \"we need annual influenza virus vaccines to keep pace with continuing viral evolution,\" the researchers behind the discovery said in a statement . \"Our work suggests that the barriers to eliciting more broadly protective immunity may be surprisingly low,\" they said. There are four types of flu virus , known as influenza A, B, C and D, with A and B being responsible for the seasonal flu epidemics in the U.S. every year. Influenza A comes in many subtypes whose differences lie in two proteins that the virus uses to infect our cells: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). For example, H1N1 and H3N2 are subtypes of influenza A that routinely infect people. Within each subtype are different \"strains\" that constantly tweak their genetic code. For example, a strain of H1N1 is currently the dominant virus causing flu in the U.S. Influenza B, meanwhile, is divided into two lineages \u2014 Yamagata and Victoria \u2014 and is typically responsible for a much smaller proportion of flu cases. Making effective flu shots relies on harnessing the protective power of antibodies \u2014 immune proteins that attack invading pathogens \u2014 but the virus' ability to quickly mutate makes this challenging. Flu vaccines prime the immune system to produce specific antibodies that latch onto a flu virus and prevent it from infecting cells after it invades the body. However, these vaccines are formulated to target specific strains , and because those strains mutate year over year, people then need a new flu shot each year to keep up. Related: 'Long flu' is real, and we've likely 'ignored it for a long time' In the new study, published Thursday (Dec. 21) in the journal PLOS Biology , scientists described a newfound class of antibodies in human blood samples that target multiple forms of the influenza A virus. The research was conducted only in the lab, so the scientists aren't sure exactly how these antibodies contribute to the body's flu shot response. However, one day, these antibodies could be used to develop vaccines that are more effective at protecting people from multiple strains of flu at the same time. To guard against influenza A, conventional flu vaccines usually prompt the immune system to produce antibodies against the H protein on the surface of the virus. Antibodies have previously been discovered that target two main types of hemagglutinin, called H1 and H3, at the same time. However, they can only do this if there is a specific mutation in H1, namely the insertion of an amino acid in the outer edge of the protein that binds to a receptor on the outside of our cells . This consequently limits the antibodies' efficacy against different flavors of flu virus. Through lab experiments, the study authors identified antibodies that are abundant in human blood and can bind to certain H1 and H3 strains of influenza A, whether or not this hemagglutinin mutation is present. This means that they'd theoretically be able to provide broad protection against both subtypes of virus, potentially even as circulating strains mutate over time. The authors also looked at how well these antibodies targeted strains of H1 and H3 that have circulated in the past. The antibodies reacted with H3 strains from the late 1980s to late 1990s and H1 strains from the early 2000s through to 2015. This suggests the patients whose blood was sampled originally made the antibodies in response to H3 strains of the virus. Then, after a later exposure to H1 strains at a later date through either infection or vaccination, the antibodies became primed to target H1 as well. These findings may have important applications for future vaccine design. \"Given the right series of influenza virus exposures\/vaccinations, it is possible for humans to mount robust antibody responses that neutralize divergent H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, opening new avenues to design improved vaccines,\" the authors said in the statement. In other words, there may be a way to ensure vaccines trigger the production of these broad-acting antibodies, to ensure the shots guard against both subtypes of the virus equally well.",

        "text":"Share on Pinterest Scientists are studying the effects of psilocybin from mushrooms on the brain. The Washington Post\/Getty Images Researchers report that psilocybin from mushrooms can help relieve depression for people with cancer. They noted that psilocybin is not a treatment for cancer but said it can help with the disposition and outlook of people with cancer. Psilocybin is listed as a schedule I drug by federal authorities and has not been approved for clinical use by federal officials. Mushrooms may be more magical than previously believed. A new study published in the journal Cancer reports that psilocybin from mushrooms may help people being treated for cancer and\/or depression. Results from a phase two clinical trial found that psilocybin \u2013 a hallucinogenic chemical found in certain types of mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe \u2013 helped trial participants. The study authors said the participants experienced fewer symptoms of depression and \u201cspoke highly of the therapy when interviewed at the end of the trial.\u201d Psilocybin can alter mood, perception, and cognition by binding to a specific subtype of serotonin receptor in the brain. The substance is currently considered a schedule I drug by the U.S. government, currently defined as having a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. The Food and Drug Administration also has not approved it for clinical use. However, the study authors said \u201cmultiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and potential efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy\u2014which combines psilocybin with psychological support from trained therapists\u2014to treat major depressive disorder.\u201d They also pointed out there\u2019s plenty of research taking place concerning using psilocybin in treating mental health conditions, including addiction, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Details from the psilocybin mushroom study The new study involved adults with cancer and depression. In the trial, 30 people received a 25 mg dose of synthesized psilocybin, group therapy, and a one-on-one session with a therapist at Sunstone Therapies in Rockville, Maryland. \u201cThis study was differentiated by its group approach. Cohorts of three to four patients were simultaneously treated with 25 mg of psilocybin in adjacent rooms open at the same time, in a one-to-one, therapist-patient ratio,\u201d said Dr. Manish Agrawal, a lead study author and chief executive officer at Sunstone Therapies, in a statement. \u201cThe cohorts had preparation for the therapy as well as integration sessions following the psilocybin session as a group.\u201d Researchers reported that participants showed moderate to severe depression scores at the beginning of the study. Eight weeks later, the research team observed subjects\u2019 depression severity scores dropped by an average of 19 points, \u201ca magnitude that would indicate the majority no longer experienced depression,\u201d they wrote. Treatment produced a sustained response in 80% of the participants, with 50% showing full remission of depressive symptoms after a week of the eight-week treatment. Subjects reported side effects such as headache and nausea and headaches were generally mild, the researchers reported. \u201cAs an oncologist for many years, I experienced the frustration of not being able to provide cancer care that treats the whole person, not just the tumor,\u201d Agrawal said. \u201cThis was a small, open-label study and more research needs to be done, but the potential is significant and could have implications for helping millions of patients with cancer who are also struggling with the severe psychological impact of the disease.\u201d What study participants thought of psilocybin clinical trial Agrawal was also senior author of a second study led by Dr. Yvan Beaussant, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, that involved subjects\u2019 exit interviews. Most subjects described positive experiences, noting that the group dynamic calmed their fears and made them feel more prepared for therapy. The authors said subjects said they felt being connected to the group \u201cdeepened and enriched their experience, ultimately contributing to their experience of self-transcendence and compassion for one another.\u201d Group and individual sessions seemed to work in different ways. Participants said having individual and group sessions allowed therapy to remain intimate and introspective while also giving it a sense of togetherness. \u201cIt was profoundly moving and encouraging to witness the magnitude of participants\u2019 improvement and the depth of their healing journey following their participation in the trial,\u201d Beaussant said in the statement. \u201cParticipants overwhelmingly expressed positive sentiments about their experience of psilocybin-assisted therapy while emphasizing the importance of the supportive, structured setting in which it took place.\u201d The authors said the process still needs additional studies to include more people, along with a control arm comparing effects to other treatments or placebo. Experts discuss mushrooms\u2019 effects on the brain Dr. Akanksha Sharma, a neurooncologist who specializes in oncology and palliative medicine at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in California and was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that doctors are still learning about how psychedelics change the brain. \u201cAt this point, we know that altered states of consciousness can help patients face and process difficult emotions associated with their disease,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIn this state with the right guides, we can potentially reframe and accept our condition or find peace. These agents can contribute to neuroplasticity, which means that our brain can make new connections and change the way it is responding to stress and negative emotions.\u201d Sharma said psilocybin doesn\u2019t directly treat cancer, although \u201crewiring\u201d of neural networks could be helpful. He said the chemical shifts perspective, which can help people think differently about life and death and bring spiritual peace and acceptance. \u201cThe downsides are that this time we still have a lot to learn regarding how it works and how it affects us so there is always inherent risk with that,\u201d Sharma explained. \u201cIn addition, \u2018opening our mind and heart\u2019 in this manner cannot be done without expert therapists and support. Patients should be guided through this otherwise they can experience anxiety, panic, confusion, and can have high blood pressure, and cardiac side effects they may not be able to manage, if on their own or with inexperienced people. We also don\u2019t yet know any long-term effects. How psilocybin can help people with cancer Dr. David Rabin is a psychedelic medicine expert and the founder and chief medical officer at Apollo Neuroscience who wasn\u2019t involved in the studies. Rabin told Medical News Today there\u2019s no evidence psilocybin treats cancer, \u201cbut as far as the depression and hopelessness associated with cancer, there\u2019s a lot of evidence stemming from Roland Griffiths\u2019 original work from John Hopkins University suggesting strongly that a single dose of psilocybin is extremely effective at helping reduce the depression and anxiety surrounding end of life in cancer patients.\u201d \u201cA big reason for this is the nature of how psilocybin, delivered in a safe environment with proper conditions and therapeutic preparation, gives the patient a sense of profound unity, enhanced safety, and connectedness to something greater than themselves,\u201d Rabin explained. \u201cIt reaffirms their sense of self above and beyond the illness they\u2019re suffering from. This is very much reinforcing belief and hope.\u201d Rabin said psilocybin works well with cancer patients because it allows people an opportunity to separate their sense of self from the words that were given to describe themselves and their illness. \u201cIt restores hope and lifts feelings of depression and anxiety, which can accelerate healing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that using psilocybin extends life, but it definitely helps patients live better with the time they have.\u201d",

        "title":"Did the COVID-19 pandemic lead to changes in our personality traits?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/covid-19-pandemic-changes-in-personality-traits",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Anna Malgina\/Stocksy The major personality traits are considered to remain relatively stable over most of a person\u2019s adult life but can be influenced by stressful personal events. A recent study found changes in the expression of personality traits during the COVID-19 pandemic in a nationally representative sample. The findings suggest that younger people were more susceptible to changes in personality traits, showing a decline in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and an increase in neuroticism. These results suggest that, in addition to stressful personal events, global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to changes in personality traits. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. Was this helpful? Previous studies have shown that levels of neuroticism declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A new study published in PLOS One found that these changes in neuroticism were short-lived and normalized later in the pandemic in 2021-2022. However, other personality traits such as agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness declined during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021-2022. The study found that younger individuals were especially susceptible to changes in personality traits during the pandemic, suggesting a disruption of the personality development and maturation process that normally occurs during young adulthood. Medical News Today spoke with Dr. Brent Roberts, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cIt is quite significant from a theoretical perspective to know that global events, like the pandemic, might have the effect of changing personality, which is often thought to be fixed and impervious to change,\u201d Dr. Roberts said. \u201cIt is also of potential pragmatic value, as from an epidemiological standpoint, the changes over the long run, being somewhat negative and centered on young adults would mean that these cohorts would be more vulnerable to problematic mental and physical health outcomes due solely to psychological and not physiological reasons,\u201d he explained. Five-factor model of personality The five-factor model of personality is a widely used model that describes personality based on the presence of five broad traits. The model includes the following five personality traits: Extraversion \u2014 a tendency for outgoing, energetic, and assertive behaviors Neuroticism \u2014 a tendency for persistent and excessive pessimism and anxiety Conscientiousness \u2014 a tendency to be organized, self-disciplined, responsible, and hard-working Agreeableness \u2014 a tendency to be empathetic, friendly, compliant, and trustworthy Openness \u2014 a tendency to be curious, imaginative, and open-minded These personality traits remain relatively stable over an adult\u2019s lifetime and are generally unaffected by personal experience. Previous studies have shown that individuals show a small change in personality traits with age. Specifically, conscientiousness and agreeableness tend to increase gradually with age, whereas neuroticism, openness, and extraversion tend to decrease. Although regarded as generally stable, personal stressful or traumatic events can influence these personality traits. In contrast, studies examining the impact of collective stressful events, such as the 2011 earthquake in New Zealand or Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana, have shown a lack of change in personality traits in response to these events. The COVID-19 pandemic differs from other natural disasters in its global impact and influence on all aspects of life. Previous studies have shown a decline in neuroticism during the early or acute stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that many individuals with generally higher anxiety levels \u2014 associated with neuroticism \u2014 experienced lower anxiety levels during the pandemic\u2019s early phase. However, there is limited and contradictory evidence on the impact of the pandemic on other personality traits. In addition, there is limited data on the pandemic\u2019s impact on personality traits beyond 2020. The present study used data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) to examine the impact of the early and subsequent stages of the COVID-19 pandemic on personality traits in a large and diverse population. The UAS consists of an internet panel of about 9,500 individuals representing the national population. The UAS has administered multiple personality assessments over the internet to enrolled participants since its inception in 2014. Changes in personality traits In the current study, the researchers categorized the period encompassing the pandemic into the acute phase spanning the period between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, and the adaptation phase spanning the period between January 1, 2021, and February 16, 2022. The study included 7,109 participants in the UAS who had completed at least one personality assessment before the pandemic and another assessment during either the acute or adaptation phase of the pandemic. In comparison with pre-pandemic levels, the researchers found that neuroticism decreased during the acute phase of the pandemic in 2020. This decline in neuroticism levels was, however, not sustained during the subsequent adaptation phase in 2021-2022, with levels of neuroticism in the adaptation phase being similar to those observed before the pandemic. The other four personality traits showed an opposite trend to that observed with neuroticism. The levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and extraversion during the acute phase of the pandemic did not differ from their levels before the pandemic. In contrast, the levels of all four traits decreased during 2021-2022 compared with their pre-pandemic levels. Notably, the changes in the expression of these personality traits were similar to those normally observed during a decade of adulthood. The researchers noted that further research is needed to determine whether the changes in personality traits observed in 2021-2022 were enduring and to evaluate potential longer-term outcomes. Personality traits among subgroups The researchers further analyzed the data to examine the changes in personality traits among different age and ethnic\/racial groups. The researchers found the highest levels of decline in neuroticism during 2020 in participants ages 65 years and over, followed by middle-aged individuals (30-64 years). However, the decline in neuroticism in younger participants ages under 30 years did not reach significance during the acute phase. Interestingly, younger adults showed higher levels of neuroticism in 2021-2022 than before the pandemic. Although the levels of the four remaining personality traits were lower in 2021-2022 among younger and middle-aged participants, the decline in agreeableness and conscientiousness was more profound among younger participants. In contrast, the levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness among older individuals in 2021-2022 were similar to pre-pandemic levels. These data suggest that younger adults were more sensitive to changes in personality traits than their middle-aged and older counterparts. The personality of older individuals, on the other hand, seemed more resilient to the effects of the pandemic. The study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Angelina Sutin, a professor at the Florida State University, noted: \u201cThe traits that showed the most change in younger adulthood \u2013 neuroticism and conscientiousness \u2013 are also the traits that are associated with many important outcomes, including educational and career success, relationships, and mental and physical health. The changes were relatively small, but the cumulative impact could be significant if the changes persist.\u201d Personality traits tend to consolidate during young adulthood as an individual\u2019s personality develops and matures. This could potentially explain why younger adults were more vulnerable to changes in personality traits in response to the pandemic. An alternative reason for these findings could be that the sources of stress (such as job- or school-related stress) associated with the pandemic might have been different for each age group. Among ethnic\/racial groups, the impact of the pandemic on the personality traits of Hispanic\/ Latino participants deviated from that observed in non-Hispanic\/Latino participants. For instance, Hispanic\/Latino participants showed a larger decrease in extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness than their non-Hispanic\/Latino counterparts in 2021-2022. The researchers speculate that Hispanic\/Latino participants may have experienced greater stress levels due to working outside the home and being at increased risk of COVID-19.",

New Normal Health Coronavirus data All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. Was this helpful? In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. New Normal Health Coronavirus resources For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub. Was this helpful? Fear and isolation The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress. Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d Worldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d Early impact The beginning of the pandemic appears to have had the greatest impact on mental health. A report from the European Parliament Research Service highlighted increases in mental health concerns in many European countries at this time. Eight out of 10 people in Italy reported a need for psychological care; in the Netherlands, over a third of the population reported anxiety. Similar patterns became evident in the United States. In a study of people aged 18-35, 80% of survey respondents reported significant depressive symptoms, while 61% reported moderate or severe anxiety. In April 2021, the National Institute of Mental Health reported that rates for anxiety, depression, stress-related symptoms, substance misuse , and suicidal thoughts were almost double those expected before the pandemic. However, concerns that suicide rates might rise appear to have been unfounded as, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , these have fallen slightly. In the United Kingdom, mental health referrals to the National Health Service (NHS) have reached record levels, as Dr. James told MNT: \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on already stretched specialist mental health services, which received a record 4.3 million referrals during 2021. It\u2019s also resulted in the largest mental health backlog in NHS history with at least 1.4 million people waiting for treatment.\u201d Who is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d On the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d Taking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d",

        "text":"Millions of people experience overt or covert racism that affects their day-to-day lives. But sometimes, the impact of such discrimination spills into healthcare, bringing life threatening consequences. So, when it comes to racial health disparities, can so-called biological differences explain these statistics, or is the misuse of science preventing us from getting to the root of the problem? Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen Have you ever been asked a seemingly innocuous question that later left you feeling uncomfortable? Perhaps it made you think, would any other person, especially someone of a different ethnic or racial background, be asked that same question? For some of us, this can be the classic question of \u201cWhere are you really from?\u201d or perhaps comments such as \u201cYou are so articulate\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I have several [insert race\/ethnicity here] friends.\u201d These questions and behaviors are what are now coined as \u2018microaggressions,\u2019 which, by definition, are negative racial slights, biases, prejudices, and insults\u2014whether intentional or unintentional\u2014toward people of different races and ethnicities. We can encounter such behaviors wherever we go and in a multitude of environments. One such instance is within healthcare settings. I, for example, was recently asked by a healthcare professional if I had experienced \u201cfemale genital mutilation,\u201d which at the time did not seem pertinent to the issue I was facing but left me feeling rather uncomfortable after I sat with it. Being of British-Turkish mix descent, I wondered if any of my other white friends would be asked the same question. Although, in my case, it did not have any adverse effects on my treatments or care, that may not always be the case. And I know I receive rather \u2018privileged\u2019 treatment because of the way I present, compared to other minoritized groups. Within healthcare contexts, the gravity of this discrimination becomes more apparent when patients and healthcare workers experience negative consequences , which often lead to lower standards of care and a higher risk of illness. This month, we sat down with Dr. Monique Rainford, obstetrician and gynecologist at the Yale School of Medicine, and author of the book \u201cPregnant While Black,\u201d and Angela Saini, science journalist and author whose most recent work includes the book \u201cSuperior: The Return of Race Science,\u201d to discuss what impact racism has on health and whether biological \u2018race\u2019 science can actually explain all the health disparities experienced by different racial groups. You can listen to this month\u2019s episode below, or on your preferred streaming platform: Microaggressions and the COVID-19 pandemic After I shared my own experience, Dr. Rainford explained what a microaggression is and how it may feel to the person experiencing it: \u201c[The] example that you shared is a microaggression, in the sense that when you were asked a certain history, and you wondered if you would have been asked otherwise [if you were from a different background]. You don\u2019t necessarily realize it at the time [that] something is off [or] different. You don\u2019t realize it at the time because it\u2019s almost a shock. [A]nd then at some point, you realize and say \u2018Oh, it is because I\u2019m a person of this race or this ethnicity. And it is happening to me again, and again,'\u201d she said. Chiming into the conversation to share her own experience was Angela Saini. \u201cI can feel the frustration because I feel the same a lot. I\u2019ll just give you an example. So, at the beginning of the pandemic, in 2020, there was so much speculation on the part of medical doctors as well and medical professionals, researchers about racial differences in who was catching the virus.\u201d Did COVID-19 affect races differently? Describing it as \u201cbizarre,\u201d Saini pointed out how \u201cbizarre\u201d it was for the medical community to have thought that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was affecting people of different races and ethnicities in varying severities. \u201cThis would be the first time in history that a virus affected races differently if that had been the case with COVID-19,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet there was this widespread assumption that this was possible with this particular one. And I couldn\u2019t believe some of the things that I was reading, [t]hat was being published in the medical literature,\u201d she continued. During the early days of the pandemic, news outlets and the U.K. government were reporting that British Asians were dying at a higher rate than other ethnic and racial groups due to COVID-19. These concerns were reflected in the correspondence Saini received from medical professionals in the field. \u201cI remember one dentist, Asian dentists, emailing me and saying, \u2018Is it safe for me to go to work because I\u2019ve heard that Asian people are more susceptible to this virus naturally, genetically more susceptible than other people.\u2019 And I just said \u2018The reason that British Asians are dying in larger numbers, especially that year was because we tended to work in frontline professions more than anybody else,'\u201d she said. Saini also pointed out that the first SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks hit London, which is \u201ca minority white British city with a huge British Asian population.\u201d She said comparatively, \u201cthe statistics are not going to look the same\u201d as the rest of the U.K. This not only propagated misinformation at the time but also affected vaccine uptake. Racism: A maternal health problem Dr. Rainford also shared Shalon Irving\u2019s story, a 36-year-old Black mother, who was an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but died three weeks after giving birth due to complications of high blood pressure. \u201cDr. Shalon Irving was a double Ph.D., and she worked at the CDC. So she was a woman, an educated woman with means who had a successful delivery by cesarean section for other reasons. But after delivery, she had some issues, and she kept returning to seek medical care for those issues related to high blood pressure, which was existing,\u201d she said. \u201cShe kept returning, however, it seems\u2014based on everything I\u2019ve read and know\u2014that the system failed her. They kept telling her everything was okay. They kept telling her; she was alright, they kept sending her home. And the last time they sent her home, they gave her a prescription for an antihypertensive pill. And she went home collapsed, and was immediately rushed to the hospital life support. Shortly after that, she died, that was within weeks of delivery of her very first child,\u201d she continued. Dr. Rainford said Dr. Irving\u2019s story was one that influenced her to discover more about the disparities that Black women face in the U.S. and write her book, in which she aimed to uncover, expose, and explain this problem. How the stress of racism affects aging and health When one talks of the impact of racism on health, epigenetics is an important area of study to include in the discussion. In essence, epigenetics is rooted in the idea that people\u2019s behaviors and their environment can cause changes in the way genes are expressed. Such changes\u2014or in other words, the transgenerational effects of adversity\u2014have been observed in the immune system, on mental health, and even the gut microbiome. A recent study, for example, found that hardships experienced by mothers during their childhood or pregnancy were reflected in the composition of their children\u2019s gut microbiomes. Dr. Rainford said that the works of Dr. David Barker originally from the U.K. and Dr. Kent Thornburg in the U.S. are of particular importance when discussing epigenetics. \u201cThey found that epigenetic changes [d]on\u2019t change the genes, but they change how genes are expressed that can be passed from generation to generation. And they\u2019ve noted that stress, including the chronic stresses of racism, can cause those epigenetic effects that affect the children of people suffering those stressors, and the grandchildren of people suffering those stressors. And those stressors could be both economic and racial discrimination,\u201d she said. Racial weathering Dr. Rainford introduced the terms \u201cweathering\u201d and \u201callostatic load\u201d to our conversation when discussing the long-term health impacts of racism. The latter can be described as \u201cthe wear and tear on the body\u201d from the chronic stress and cumulative burden an individual faces. \u201cAnother effect that is \u2018biological\u2019 but due to the stress of racism is something called weathering, quantifying this allostatic load,\u201d she said, referring to Dr. Arline T. Geronimus \u2018 work. \u201cShe found that Black women have a biological age of 10 years in excess of their chronological age because of the stresses of racism,\u201d said Dr. Rainford. Multiple studies have since found evidence of this type of accelerated aging. One, for example, found that Black people are approximately three years older biologically than white people. Dr. Rainford also touched on the work of Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn on telomeres, the protective tips at the end of chromosomes, which have been hailed as the \u201csecret to longevity.\u201d \u201c[Dr. Blackburn] found that chronic caregivers had shorter telomeres because of the stress of giving chronic care to someone who\u2019s ill. And she found that non-poor Black women also had shorter telomeres compared to white women and even men,\u201d she said. Dr. Rainford said this can explain why chronic stressors such as racism often lead to having diseases at an earlier age than one normally would. Can science explain racial health disparities? When discussing racial differences in health outcomes, the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system is often one of the first things to come to mind. Dr. Hilary Guite asked our guests what their take on it was. \u201cWe know that hypertension is higher among Black Americans and Black Britons. Preventable heart disease and stroke resulting from high blood pressure are two to three times more likely to kill a Black American than a white American. So it\u2019s very easy for physicians then to draw correlations between some kind of biological difference and race,\u201d said Saini. She quoted research by Canadian epidemiologist Jay Kaufman, and American hypertension expert Richard Cooper, who found little to no genetic evidence that can account for such differences. \u201c[G]enetics has hugely undermined our ideas about deep-seated racial difference. And sometimes to the surprise of some geneticists who are expecting to see, for example, some kind of exceptional genetic groups in faraway places among indigenous groups, [they see] they are not particularly genetically exceptional. So, the vast majority of genetic difference is at the individual level, not at the group level,\u201d she said. Making a distinction between biology and genetics, Dr. Rainford further explained that the environmental conditions people grow up in are more likely to have a larger effect on health outcomes. \u201cIf you are in a low-income community, and you do not have access to fresh food, you will eat what you can get, and what you can get is unhealthy for you. Also, what they found in studies is that air pollution in areas where predominantly Black people and people of color live is worse than air pollution in areas where predominantly white people live. [I]t\u2019s a multiple of factors that ultimately have a biological effect, but nothing to do with genetic[s],\u201d she said. Is race a biological variable? Using color to understand human differences and \u201cdividing up the world by color\u2014black, white, yellow, red, brown\u201d was \u201coutlandish,\u201d said Saini. \u201c[Racial categories were] largely informed by the politics of the time, the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, the patterns of economic political power at that time, which were divided along continental lines. And so this became conflated in the public imagination and in the medical imagination as some kind of meaningful way of understanding human variation,\u201d Saini explained. She reiterated that the classification of race has varied between countries and over time, which is testament that it is not a biological variable. \u201cSo, for example, I moved to the U.S. two years ago. If I had moved in 1971 instead of 2021, I would be officially categorized as white. I\u2019m now categorized as Asian. But in the U.S., people of Indian heritage were categorized as white in 1971. So we have to understand that these categories are not fixed. They\u2019re not static; they\u2019re always moving. And the reason for that is because the social conception of what race is, the social meaning of it is always changing,\u201d she explained. \u201cBecause race, I cannot stress enough, is not a biological variable. It was invented a few 100 years ago because of society and politics. If you understand the history of it, there\u2019s no way that you can start to treat it as a biological variable because it just doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s like talking about class as a biological variable.\u201d \u2014 Angela Saini",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/covid-19-did-lockdown-help-or-hinder-our-creativity",
        "text":"New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. Was this helpful? Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle\/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. What were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity. The role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem Having more free time The elimination of commuting returned hours to many people, leaving them with more free time, although this was not likely true for everyone. Parents, for example, may have had less free time with children confined at home all day. Participants were asked about how many hours they worked, how much free time, and how much personal space they had. The authors came to this conclusion: \u201cAn increase in free time was linked to higher creativity change.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/medical-myths-all-about-ibd",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY. 1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d 2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD. 4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d 5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d 6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery. 7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d 8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d 9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD. 10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. 11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure.",

        "title":"Can Paxlovid Improve Long COVID Symptoms?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/opinion\/faustfiles\/107603",
        "text":"Jeremy Faust is editor-in-chief of , an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and a public health researcher. He is author of the Substack column Inside Medicine. Follow Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan. In this interview, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, talks with Harlan Krumholz, MD, SM, of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, about his ongoing study testing nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) for long COVID symptoms and about the value of finding innovative, participant-centric ways to conduct research and get answers quickly. The following is a transcript of their remarks: Faust: Hi, this is Jeremy Faust, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today. We're going to talk about long COVID and Paxlovid. Does Paxlovid actually help people with diagnosed long COVID get better? This is a study that is being conducted -- there are several studies -- and one of the investigators on one of those studies is cardiologist and Yale School of Medicine outcomes researcher, Dr. Harlan Krumholz. Harlan, great to see you. Krumholz: It's great to see you, Jeremy. Faust: Alright, so long COVID. You have been studying this and you're currently engaged in a randomized clinical trial. Can you tell us what you guys are looking at? Krumholz: Sure. And when you say \"you guys,\" let me just say I have the great privilege of working with Akiko Iwasaki. Honestly for me, the ability to work with a renowned scientist like that in the lab is essential to this kind of research. I mean, I'm a clinical investigator, I'm an outcomes researcher. I really care whether or not we can produce knowledge that can tangibly improve people's lives, help them feel better, actually relieve the suffering. But I recognize in a condition like this, unlike where I'm usually studying, like heart disease is fairly well-characterized, it's pretty mature. We still have a lot to learn, but I've never been in a situation where we've got a disease that is puzzling to most people. They don't understand the underlying mechanisms, it's not clear what the taxonomy is or what we're actually dealing with, and what an honor for me to be able to work with someone who can actually help provide insight into the underlying immunologic dimensions of this condition. That plus we got a whole team of people, really talented individuals, and we came together and said, there are various different underlying causes potentially of long COVID. One of them is this idea of viral persistence, that people just never get rid of the virus and it continues to cause mischief in a wide variety of ways. Let's try an antiviral, and there may be many choices in that. In part, it was because as we were in conversation with various groups. Pfizer was interested in seeing Paxlovid applied in this way and was willing to provide funding for us to do it and willing to provide the drug. So for us it was an idea that, let's get started. Let's try to create a platform where we can do remarkable research in highly efficient ways, utilizing digital data, and really see if we can do a decentralized study -- one where people don't have to go to sites, build up that platform, and if we can start with Paxlovid, let's start. That's what we did. We got out of the gates with a trial that would focus on using Paxlovid for 15 days in people highly symptomatic with long COVID and see whether or not we could learn anything. Faust: Right. And that's the distinction that I just always have to myself be reminded of, which is this is not a study of people who have COVID right now in the first few days of illness, they're getting Paxlovid for a certain amount of time and then we look down 3, 6, 9, 12 months later to see if they got long COVID. That is not what this is. This is for people who actually already have the diagnosis of long COVID, right? Krumholz: That's right. That's exactly right. Those studies are meritorious too, but they're prevention studies. Can we make an intervention early that lowers the risk of people ever developing something like long COVID? I'm interested in those. I think we all should be. But there are lots of people out there who are suffering from the ravages of COVID throughout the course of the pandemic who 3 months or longer later are still having debilitating symptoms. For many of them, their lives have been unraveled. The question is: what can we do to help them? What is going on with them to cause the kind of symptoms that they've got? The \"what\" is, obviously, we're trying to see whether or not an antiviral Paxlovid can make a difference for people who are suffering from long COVID. But we thought, can we innovate the way that we do trials? The idea was, could we create a digital, decentralized, and democratized approach to doing a clinical trial in which we didn't need any sites. We're actually going direct to consumer, we're going straight to the people, one IRB [institutional review board], no site contracts. And what we're doing is enlisting people to fill out a questionnaire. If they qualify, we get them to integrate their medical records; we can review the records at a distance. If they qualify, we call them up, make sure what's in the record really reflects their reality, what they understand as their conditions and comorbidities, and do they qualify for this study. If they qualify, we're off to the races -- we can randomize them, we ship [the] drug, we send people to their homes to get biospecimens that go to Akiko's lab; they do daily diaries on their device. We're in constant communication with them, a lot digital, some by phone. They're filling out surveys, the patient-reported outcome measures, and we're getting the feeds from their medical records to look at their healthcare utilization. And all the time, everything's being done from the convenience, largely, of their home; they don't have to leave. Many of these people are quite debilitated, tired, fatigued, and really don't have the financial resources. For those who are working hourly, it would be a big deal to have to take off half a day to go to a site, even to drive and use gas. There are no clinical trial deserts in this study, because no matter where you live, you can be part of it. And we enrolled rapidly. The study, once we sort of worked out the kinks and the processes, is going extraordinarily well. I think it can be a means by which we can do highly efficient trials going forward that are really consumer-centric, participant-centric. The other thing is, we don't call these people \"subjects.\" They're our partners in the project. We're going to return results to them, we're going to give them access to investigators through town halls when we're finished, and we work hard to treat them with respect. We want them to give us like a net promoter score of five. Like, \"Hey, I would brag to my friends that they should be in trials like this because they treat me well and I'm part of the team and we're on a mission together.\" So yeah, we're really excited about how we did this and think that this can be a standard going forward. Faust: I'm really interested in the idea of not knowing. One of the real successes of our COVID experience was the ACTIV trial and the RECOVERY trial in the U.K. where just a lot of things were tried and we said, \"We're not smart enough to know which of these things is going to work. We just know that maybe among this group of 10, one thing will play out.\" Do you feel like you have so many people who are interested here that you could throw in at some point a metformin arm or some other arm of the study, because Paxlovid is one thing, but there are other candidates? Krumholz: Yeah, I think that's a really great question and a very important point. We would be best off to do these kinds of platform trials where in the course of it we're testing 20 things. If it's an early study, then it's signal-finding. If you were really actually trying to test the hypothesis formally, it has to be powered appropriately. But there are enough people out there who are suffering who could be parts of these. We really are moving too slowly. If we just do things one at a time, we're not going to learn fast enough to really solve this problem in the near future. So I like what you're saying and I totally agree with it, and that in part was the idea behind how we built this platform. We wanted to be able to build this so that now if you've got five or six more things, if we can get the funding for it, why wouldn't you just build it in? We're all sitting ready to go. Faust: Here we are coming into December of 2023 already and people are eager for results. When do you think we're going to get a readout from your study? Krumholz: I think we'll finish up soon after the first of the year. I would say by June, I hope we'll be able to have a report out. Our primary endpoint is 28 days with the PROMIS [Patient-Reported Measurement Information System]-29 physical function scale. It's sort of a net overall of how your physical health is; it's the change from baseline. But we're collecting a lot of other information on mental health and a whole range of other things that we'll learn from. Again, like I said, it should be signal-finding. Who were responders, if there were any, and then we'll be able to not only characterize them from who they were clinically, demographically, and so forth, but because of the work that Akiko will do in the lab, we'll also say were there any baseline biomarkers that were indicative of people who were likely to respond to the treatment, and that could advance our understanding of the underlying mechanism, but also maybe be able to help us figure out who should be treated and who's likely to benefit. Faust: Harlan Krumholz, thanks so much for joining us. Krumholz: Thanks, Jeremy. It's great to talk to you. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/podcasts\/anamnesis\/107985",
        "text":"The following is a transcript of the podcast episode: Rachael Robertson: Hey everybody. Welcome to MedPod Today, the podcast series where MedPage Today reporters share deeper insight into the week's biggest healthcare stories. I'm your host, Rachael Robertson. Today we're talking with Kristina Fiore about how stem cell companies are marketing to long COVID patients. Then I'll discuss a rare case of abdominal ectopic pregnancy where the patient and baby both survived. After that, Michael DePeau-Wilson shares his reporting on how Americans are using emerging cannabinoids. Clinics have long been marketing unproven stem cell treatments to patients for a range of health conditions. When COVID hit, some said their products could prevent or treat the disease. Now, those companies have turned their attention to people with long COVID. Kristina Fiore is here to tell us more. So Kristina, how many clinics are selling these treatments for long COVID? How pervasive is this? Kristina Fiore: Yeah, these researchers tracked down 36 businesses that were selling stem cell and exosome treatments for long COVID. They were connected to 60 brick-and-mortar clinics, and most of the businesses were in the U.S. and Mexico. The team behind the research, led by Leigh Turner, PhD, at the University of California Irvine, has been tracking stem cell clinics in the U.S. for years. So they went back and looked at some 1,500 clinics that they've been following to see if any of those had been using COVID to their advantage. And sure enough, they were. Turner told me that this is a very vulnerable population that's suffering a lot. And these companies know that these patients may try anything to try to feel better. Robertson: What are the risks here? What can go wrong for these patients if they try these unproven therapies? Fiore: Turner says that a lot can go wrong. These treatments are experimental, so there's no evidence that they actually work in long COVID. Patients may not be helped at all. Then there are examples of stem cell and exosome products causing infections that can be severe, leading people to go to the hospital. There is even one report of people going blind after intravitreal stem cell injections. And on top of that, there's an \"obvious possibility for financial scams,\" Turner told me. The average price for these treatments was $11,000. \"It's not like going to the drugstore and buying some dietary supplements,\" Turner said. Robertson: That is so expensive. Are regulators going after these companies? Fiore: Yes, both the FDA and the FTC have gone after stem cell companies in the past, and they've mostly issued warning letters. And Turner said that while these agencies have done quite a lot, there's still a \"massive marketplace.\" Turner said that he'd like to see regulators get tougher on these businesses that are marketing stem cells for long COVID. Since there are only 36 companies, Turner thinks that a crackdown seems pretty manageable. It's just not clear how likely that would be. In the meantime, patients just need to be vigilant about the fact that these procedures are experimental, that there's not much evidence behind any of them, and that they aren't going to be guaranteed to relieve the varied symptoms of long COVID. Robertson: Thanks for that update, Kristina. Fiore: Thanks, Rachael. Robertson: Now, Kristina will take the host seat to ask me a few questions. Fiore: As many of our listeners know, the New England Journal of Medicine has an \"images in clinical medicine\" series that showcases unusual images from clinical practice. One of those recent images was of a highly rare abdominal ectopic pregnancy. Even more rare \u2013 both the neonate and mother survived. Rachael is here to tell us more about it. So Rachael, can you describe the image? Robertson: So the image is an ultrasound of a woman's torso. You can see the side profile of a fairly large fetus with an umbilical cord. And Guillaume Gorincour, MD, PhD, and his co-authors describe the fetus as being at 23 weeks' gestation. But the catch is the fetus is in the abdomen. Below the fetus is a completely empty uterus where the fetus should be growing. And because the fetus is outside the uterus, it's an ectopic pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes. Gorincour told me that the abdominal ectopic pregnancies make up less than 1% of all ectopic pregnancies. Fiore: Wow, super, super rare. So what do we know about the patient? How did this pregnancy get so far along with the fetus growing in the wrong place? Robertson: When the patient went to the emergency room, she was 37 years old, and she had been experiencing abdominal pain for 10 days. She was from a remote island and had already delivered two babies before. She had also miscarried once. After doctors realized that she had an abdominal ectopic pregnancy, she was transferred to a tertiary care hospital and then a few weeks later at 29 weeks' gestation, the fetus was surgically removed. Two weeks after that, the placenta was surgically removed too. The mother was in the hospital for about a month and then the neonate was there for about 2 months. Remarkably, both of them survived to discharge, though unfortunately, they were both lost to follow up, so we don't know anything about their current status. Fiore: Wow, that's, that's amazing. So tell us more about why this case is so unusual. Robertson: So in addition to being really rare, it's also dangerous for abdominal ectopic pregnancies to continue so far. Gorincour told me that technically, abdominal ectopic pregnancies are the only ectopic pregnancies that can continue beyond 20 weeks. But there are huge risks, including placental hemorrhage. I spoke with a maternal fetal medicine doctor, David Hackney, MD, and he emphasized that in this situation, the patient was really, really lucky. Generally, you would identify an abdominal ectopic pregnancy much earlier than 23 weeks' gestation. And Hackney said that the standard recommendation is that those pregnancies are just too dangerous to advance. He also made it clear that this one case, which he called, \"the rarest of the rare,\" is not grounds for abdominal ectopic pregnancies to be considered viable. Gorincour told me that the maternal mortality rate for these pregnancies are more than seven times higher than other ectopic pregnancies, which are already dangerous. So while it's amazing that this patient and her baby survived, it could have gone really, really badly. Fiore: Really amazing story. Thanks, Rachael. Robertson: Thank you, Kristina. I will take the next segment. Our final story takes a look at a new study that shows more Americans are using so-called emerging cannabinoids. That includes cannabidiol, also commonly called CBD, cannabigerol, cannabinol, and delta-8-THC. The study surveyed more than 1,000 people on whether they had heard about these products or used them over the past year -- and the results were a little surprising. Michael DePeau-Wilson is here to tell us more about that. So Michael, let's just start with this. What are emerging cannabinoids? Michael DePeau-Wilson: Yeah, so these are products that are derived from hemp, which was re-categorized as a legal crop in the Farm Bill Act of 2018. And in the years that followed that change, an entire industry emerged selling various products that are now known as emerging cannabinoids. Now, the researchers of this study emphasize that these products tend to lack industry standards and are mostly unregulated, which means that there's very little known about the prevalence of their use in the U.S., even though a lot of Americans appear to be aware of their availability. One example of that in the survey is that about 70% of people are aware of the availability of CBD. Robertson: But the study's focus was on the actual use of these products, right? What did they find? DePeau-Wilson: Right, so the study asked people both about their awareness and their use of these products in the past year. And about a quarter of survey respondents said they had used one of these products in that time period. So this was surprising for researchers. You know, for comparison, the survey also showed that about 26% of survey respondents had used cannabis in that same time period. So of course, CBD, which was also the most well known of these products, was the most commonly used emerging cannabinoid. According to this study, around 20% of survey respondents reported using it. But many participants did report using some of the lesser known cannabinoids as well, for example, almost 12% reported using delta-8-THC over that same time period as well. Just to give you an idea of who's using these products, the researchers reported that younger participants -- people between the ages of 18 and 39 -- were more than twice as likely to use delta-8-THC. They also showed that non-Hispanic Black Americans were far less likely to use any of these products compared to white Americans. Robertson: You mentioned before that these products don't have strong industry standards, which I imagine could be a problem with younger people being more likely to use them. What did the researchers say about this lack of standards? DePeau-Wilson: So the researchers said that the focus of this study was to create a foundation of data to help identify who is using the products. They did emphasize that the survey results do support the need for continuous public health surveillance efforts around emerging cannabinoids, rather than just relying on these snapshots in time, like this study was able to show. And in the end, the researchers said that they hope that the data leads to more research into the use of these products, you know, such as why people are using them, the general perception around the safety of these products, and any negative health outcomes that may be related to them.

        "title":"FDA Official Blasts Ladapo\\'s Claims About DNA Fragments in COVID Shots",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/special-reports\/exclusives\/107988",
        "text":"The FDA's biologics chief issued a stern rebuke of the Florida Surgeon General's latest letter criticizing the agency's oversight of mRNA COVID vaccines, calling it \"misleading\" and equating its claims to disinformation. Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), strongly refuted claims made by Joseph Ladapo, MD, PhD, that the vaccines may be contaminated with DNA fragments. \"Perpetuating references to this information about residual DNA without placing it in the context of the manufacturing process is misleading,\" Marks wrote, concluding the letter by noting that the spread of false information around COVID vaccines was leading to serious harm. \"The challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake,\" he wrote. \"Given the dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization, and serious illness afforded by the vaccines, lower vaccine uptake is contributing to the continued death and serious illness toll of COVID-19.\" Ladapo's letter, which was addressed to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, MD, and CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, specifically asked for information on an alleged discovery of \"host cell DNA fragments\" in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. He questioned whether the shots' lipid nanoparticles could ferry contaminant DNA into human cells, and whether \"the presence of [Simian Virus] SV40 promoter\/enhancer DNA may also pose a unique and heightened risk of DNA integration into host cells.\" Marks roundly rejected these claims, offering a \"general explanation of the manufacturing process\" for the vaccine in the hope that \"it will be helpful,\" explaining that residual DNA fragments in all biological products are in exceedingly small quantities. He also said that no SV40 proteins are present in the vaccines, adding that \"it is quite implausible that the residual small DNA fragments located in the cytosol could find their way into the nucleus through the nuclear membrane present in intact cells and then be incorporated into chromosomal DNA.\" Marks also said that reproductive toxicology studies have found no evidence of residual DNA fragments getting into reproductive cells, a concern raised by Ladapo in his letter. \"We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines,\" he wrote. Ladapo initiated a similar exchange of letters with the FDA and CDC in March, when he challenged agency leadership on the safety profile of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. FDA Commissioner Califf and then-director of the CDC Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, responded with a scathing 4-page letter refuting Ladapo's claims about an alleged increase in reports from Florida to FDA's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Califf and Walensky said at the time that their letter was meant to \"correct the associated misinterpretations and misinformation about the data.\" Ladapo has repeatedly come under fire for his analysis and claims related to the COVID-19 vaccines. His office did not respond to a request for a comment on the FDA's response letter. Michael DePeau-Wilson is a reporter on MedPage Today\u2019s enterprise & investigative team.

The team narrowed the study to 622 participants \u2014 aged 5 to 17 years \u2014 who caught COVID-19; 28 went on to develop long COVID. The researchers then calculated the odds of vaccinated and unvaccinated children experiencing ongoing symptoms. The results, presented in October at the annual health-care conference IDWeek in Boston, Massachusetts, and due to be published in the coming months, demonstrated that vaccination reduced the likelihood of developing at least one long COVID symptom by 34% and of developing two or more symptoms by 48%. Yousaf says that this is likely to be an underestimate, because the study only looked at children who had an infection; it did not consider that the vaccine can reduce the chances of developing the infection, which also decreases the likelihood of long COVID. Danilo Buonsenso, a paediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome, says that the study design was \u201crigorous\u201d but points out that it defined long COVID as the persistence of symptoms after one month, whereas the World Health Organization describes long COVID as symptoms that last for at least two months. He says the study also relied on self-reporting of long COVID and not a clinical diagnosis \u2014 a problem because long COVID includes several broadly defined symptoms that children might experience on a regular basis.

Similar results in adults The findings line up with several recent studies suggesting that vaccines reduce the incidence of long COVID in adults (see, for example, ref. 2). However, paediatric data are limited \u2014 a major issue because \u201cchildren are not little adults\u201d, Snowden says. Their bodies and immune systems are growing and therefore respond to infection and vaccination differently from adults. As such, it was never a guarantee that the vaccine would have the same protective benefit against long COVID. \u201cStudies like this show that kids are worth looking at in and of themselves,\u201d Snowden says. These data are another argument in favour of vaccination, Buonsenso says, particularly for newborns who have not yet been exposed to COVID-19. Some European countries do not recommend the vaccine for younger children, in part because so many have already been exposed to the virus and thus have some immunity. Even in the United States, where the vaccine is recommended as an annual booster for children as young as 6 months, vaccination remains uncommon. As of mid-December, 7.8% of US children had received their autumn COVID-19 vaccine, well below the rate of influenza vaccination, at 43.3%.

Indeed, a recent US household survey found that the rate of long COVID in children was merely 1.3% in 2022, but that still translates to thousands of kids whose health is affected, meaning they might not be able to run around, play or go to school. \u201cIf you read the individual stories, the impact of long COVID on a child\u2019s life can be very severe,\u201d Yousaf says. \u201cCOVID is not going away,\u201d Snowden says. \u201cWe are fortunate that so far, the variants are less severe as we\u2019ve gone forward.

        "text":"New results hint at how to perfect \u2018mucosal\u2019 vaccines, which are delivered up the nose or down the throat. Particles of SARS-CoV-2 (yellow; artificially coloured) infect cells in the lining of the nasal passage.Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\/National Institutes of Health\/SPL Delivery of COVID-19 vaccines directly to the lungs and nose can stop SARS-CoV-2 infections in their tracks, according to a trio of new studies in monkeys. The research offers a boost to the wave of \u2018mucosal\u2019 COVID-19 vaccines now in development \u2014 and provides clues about how they might be improved. Until now, there has been little evidence that mucosal vaccines, which are taken by nose or mouth, shield people against infection any better than existing COVID-19 jabs do. Even so, some countries have already approved such vaccines, and key trials are under way in the United States, with others set to start. Together, the studies show that how and where vaccines are delivered can have a profound effect on the immunity generated and the protection conferred. The latest results also raise hopes that mucosal vaccines that offer \u2018sterilizing\u2019 immunity \u2014 complete blockage of infection \u2014 could become a reality. \u201cThese studies are showing you can get near sterilizing immunity,\u201d says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s not complete science fiction to think about developing vaccines that would stop transmission and infection.\u201d Jabs fall short COVID-19 jabs saved millions of lives during the pandemic and continue to do a good job of keeping at-risk individuals out of hospital. But even updated versions of existing injected vaccines offer scant and short-lived protection against infection, scientists say. Researchers think this is because injected intramuscular vaccines do a good job of stopping SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spread deep in the lungs, but are much less effective in the rest of the airway, where infections probably begin. Mucosal COVID-19 vaccines aim to trigger the production of antibodies and other immune players in the mucous membranes, or mucosa, that line the nose and the rest of the respiratory tract, in the hope that this will boost protection there. Dozens of mucosal COVID-19 vaccines are in development (see \u2018High hopes\u2019) and several have been approved in countries including China and India. But according to an 8 December report by the London-based data and analytics firm Airfinity, the efficacy of existing mucosal COVID-19 vaccines has been disappointing and the available data suggest that \u201cthey do not offer a meaningful increase in protection against infection\u201d. Source: Airfinity However, the latest studies in monkeys and other laboratory animals offer hints on how these vaccines might be improved. A team led by Dan Barouch, a vaccine scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, tried two approaches in monkeys that had previously received COVID-19 jabs: squirting a liquid vaccine into the animals\u2019 noses, or applying it directly to their tracheae1. Only the trachea-delivered vaccine substantially boosted mucosal immunity and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. \u201cWe think that the problem with intranasal delivery is that most of the vaccine is either swallowed or sneezed out,\u201d Barouch says. The results were published in Nature on 14 December. Biochemical engineer Wei Wei at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and his colleagues created a nanoparticle vaccine that includes a fragment of a SARS-CoV-2 protein, and delivered it as an aerosol into the lungs of mice, hamsters and monkeys. This triggered a strong mucosal immune response \u2014 and stymied the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated hamsters housed in cages next to one another, the researchers reported in Nature2 on 13 December. Both this study and that by Barouch\u2019s team hint that vaccines applied more deeply to the respiratory system outperform nasal sprays. China\u2019s COVID vaccines have been crucial \u2014 now immunity is waning In a third study, a team led by Robert Seder, a vaccinologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, reached a slightly different conclusion. His group used devices approved to deliver other medicines to give monkeys a booster dose of mucosal COVID-19 vaccine either by way of the nose or as an inhaled aerosol delivered through the mouth and nose. Then they exposed the animals to SARS-CoV-2. Monkeys that had received a booster dose with either device developed much lower levels of the virus in their upper airways than did monkeys that had received a booster jab, even though the animals were exposed to the virus five months after the booster. Such durability, Seder says, is \u201cstriking\u201d. The results were posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 8 November and have not yet been peer reviewed. Straight to the lungs Delivering aerosolized vaccines to the lungs might be the best strategy for mucosal COVID-19 vaccines, says Zhou Xing, a vaccine immunologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. But he adds that simple, hand-held delivery devices might need to be developed for such vaccines to be widely deployed. There is also a need to optimize the vaccines themselves, says Seder. Many of the current injectable vaccines contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but Seder\u2019s team has found that the RNA formulations used in those vaccines aren\u2019t effective when inhaled. The vaccines that Seder\u2019s and Barouch\u2019s teams tested, as well as the mucosal vaccines approved in China and India, are based instead on bioengineered adenoviruses that carry snippets of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2. The US government is supporting trials of mucosal vaccines based on other viruses: one that harnesses Newcastle disease virus, which infects birds, and a second based on a strain of SARS-CoV-2 that has been altered to replicate too slowly to cause disease. China and India approve nasal COVID vaccines \u2014 are they a game changer? The protein-based vaccine that Wei\u2019s team developed has the advantage that it can be stored at room temperature in a powdered form, reducing storage and transportation costs, Wei says. Showing that mucosal vaccines actually work \u2014 and work better than existing jabs do \u2014 is another challenge facing the field. One possibility for testing these products is a human challenge trial, in which participants are intentionally infected with a virus. Seder expects it to take at least another two or three years to develop successful mucosal vaccines for COVID-19. But the burst of interest in these vaccines has wider relevance, say scientists. If we can learn how to trigger mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2, it should be possible to do the same for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and infections we might not yet know about. \u201cIt\u2019s a worthy goal,\u201d says Hyon-Xhi Tan, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne, Australia, \u201cespecially for respiratory viruses that may pop up in the future with pandemic potential.\u201d",

        "text":"Summary: Researchers uncovered how Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) impacts COVID-19 outcomes through changes in the olfactory mucosal cells. Their study focused on individuals with AD who experienced exacerbated COVID-19 symptoms. Using an advanced 3D in vitro model of the olfactory mucosa, the research revealed that while initial infection rates were similar between healthy individuals and those with AD, the latter showed altered gene activities post-infection, indicating heightened oxidative stress and immune response changes. This study provides crucial insights into the interplay between COVID-19 and AD, particularly through the olfactory system. Key Facts: AD patients and healthy individuals have similar susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, but AD patients show altered gene activity post-infection. Changes in the olfactory mucosal cells of AD patients include heightened oxidative stress and altered immune responses. The study offers new understanding of how pre-existing conditions like AD can exacerbate COVID-19 outcomes. Source: University of Eastern Finland A new study identifies alterations in the transcriptomic signatures in human olfactory mucosal cells of individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially contributing to exacerbated COVID-19 outcomes. The study was conducted at the University of Eastern Finland in collaboration with the University of Helsinki and published in Journal of Neuroinflammation. The study was prompted by concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Olfactory dysfunction, characterized by an impaired sense of smell, is commonly associated with COVID-19 and is also observed in persons with AD. However, a significant contrast emerged in the gene activity of infected cells from individuals with AD. Credit: Neuroscience News Exploring the olfactory mucosa as a direct interface between the external environment and the brain, the research aimed to investigate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and AD within the olfactory mucosa , assessing the potential for this tissue to serve as a plausible entry route for the virus into the brain. Employing an innovative 3D in vitro model of the olfactory mucosa, the study utilized primary cells obtained from voluntary donors, including both cognitively healthy individuals and those diagnosed with AD. These cells were cultivated at the air-liquid interface (ALI), a technique providing a controlled environment that closely mimics physiological conditions. The collection of olfactory mucosal biopsies was conducted collaboratively with Kuopio University Hospital. This multidisciplinary research integrated expertise from molecular and cellular biology, neurology, and virology to investigate the effects of various SARS-CoV-2 variants on the olfactory mucosa. Distinct immune responses after infection between AD patients and healthy individuals Contrary to expectations, cells derived from healthy individuals and those with AD exhibited comparable susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating no significant difference in initial infection rates between the two groups. However, a significant contrast emerged in the gene activity of infected cells from individuals with AD. Their cells displayed heightened oxidative stress, altered immune responses, and substantial changes in genes related to olfaction when compared to olfactory mucosal cells from cognitively healthy individuals. \u201cThe results suggest a plausible scenario where individuals affected by AD might face potentially more severe COVID-19 outcomes due to pre-existing inflammation in the olfactory mucosa,\u201d says Ali Shahbaz, a doctoral researcher in Professor Katja Kanninen\u2019s research group at the University of Eastern Finland and the first author of the study. The present study represents a pivotal advancement in understanding the intricate interplay between COVID-19 and AD. Funding: The study was funded by the Academy of Finland.

Journal of Neuroinflammation Abstract Human-derived air\u2013liquid interface cultures decipher Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2013SARS-CoV-2 crosstalk in the olfactory mucosa Background The neurological effects of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) raise concerns about potential long-term consequences, such as an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and other AD-associated pathologies are also suggested to increase the risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia is a common neurological symptom reported in COVID-19 and in early AD. The olfactory mucosa (OM) is important for the perception of smell and a proposed site of viral entry to the brain. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection at the OM of individuals with AD. Methods To address this gap, we established a 3D in vitro model of the OM from primary cells derived from cognitively healthy and AD individuals. We cultured the cells at the air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) to study SARS-CoV-2 infection under controlled experimental conditions. Primary OM cells in ALI expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and several other known SARS-CoV-2 receptor and were highly vulnerable to infection. Infection was determined by secreted viral RNA content and confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the infected cells by immunocytochemistry. Differential responses of healthy and AD individuals-derived OM cells to SARS-CoV-2 were determined by RNA sequencing. Results Results indicate that cells derived from cognitively healthy donors and individuals with AD do not differ in susceptibility to infection with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, transcriptomic signatures in cells from individuals with AD are highly distinct. Specifically, the cells from AD patients that were infected with the virus showed increased levels of oxidative stress, desensitized inflammation and immune responses, and alterations to genes associated with olfaction. These results imply that individuals with AD may be at a greater risk of experiencing severe outcomes from the infection, potentially driven by pre-existing neuroinflammation. Conclusions The study sheds light on the interplay between AD pathology and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered transcriptomic signatures in AD cells may contribute to unique symptoms and a more severe disease course, with a notable involvement of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance outcomes for AD patients with viral infection. The study is crucial to better comprehend the relationship between AD, COVID-19, and anosmia. It highlights the importance of ongoing research to develop more effective treatments for those at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/health\/morel-mushrooms-food-poisoning\/",
        "text":"This article was originally published on KFF Health News. A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy. The FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave\u2019s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels. \u201cThe toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,\u201d according to the FDA guidance. Even then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: \u201cProperly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.\u201d Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana\u2019s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave\u2019s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms. Aaron Parker, the owner of Dave\u2019s Sushi, said morels are a \u201cboutique item.\u201d In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said. Many highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave\u2019s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms. Parker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels. \u201cThey had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,\u201d Parker said. According to the FDA\u2019s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked\u2014including \u201cfalse\u201d morels, which look like spongy edible morels\u2014and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked. The North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported. Marian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine\u2014a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer\u2014which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, \u201cbut some people still have reactions even though it\u2019s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.\u201d Heather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it\u2019s not as \u201cclear-cut\u201d in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave\u2019s Sushi. Mushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare\u2014the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels\u2014but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died. Before the new guidelines were issued, the FDA\u2019s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it\u2019s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave\u2019s Sushi. States\u2019 regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials\u2019 regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert. The study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms\u2014including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry\u2014may suggest a need for better communication. The study recognized a \u201cguidance document\u201d as the \u201csingle most important step forward\u201d given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms.

        "text":"Experts share tips for improving mental health as we emerge and heal from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become a big part of our daily lives. Between news reports on it, its economic costs, and the regular updates on local cases, it can feel impossible to escape COVID-19\u2019s effects. Feelings of increased anxiety, uneasiness, and fear are far from uncommon \u2014 even when people seem to be thriving at home as they pick up new hobbies or read through their entire home libraries. If you\u2019re still feeling like it\u2019s difficult to move through your day, you\u2019re not alone. How has the pandemic affected our mental health? We\u2019re just starting to truly understand the mental health effects of the past year. \u201cEveryone is experiencing this pandemic and quarantine differently,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Myszak, a child psychologist. \u201cAn apt description I\u2019ve heard is that we are all in the same storm, but we are in different types of boats.\u201d The mental health impact on adults What we do know is that living through a pandemic has removed many foundations we used to rely on, like a stable income, a social support system, and food security. That\u2019s why 2 in 5 U.S. adults reported difficulties with mental health issues and substance use in June 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Nearly 1 in 3 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Mental health professionals have also seen an increase in the number of people seeking professional help and therapy. Even as the pandemic passes its 1-year anniversary, approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults still experience high levels of distress. Many people who were required to report to their workplace in person faced daily stress and fears of contracting the coronavirus in addition to financial insecurity. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 found 34% of adults in the United States were classified as \u201cessential.\u201d Among them: Almost 1 in 3 said they would have to put an unexpected $500 medical bill on a credit card or borrow money. Almost 1 in 5 said they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay it. This type of financial insecurity can add up to an often draining work environment for people who didn\u2019t have the option to work from home. Parents whose kids were (or are) learning remotely \u2014 or were home due to trouble finding day care \u2014 may have also grappled with additional concerns. \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on parents, particularly parents of younger children,\u201d explains Christopher Beevers, professor and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn many cases, the parents have had to take on multiple roles \u2014 caregiver, teacher, parent \u2014 with few opportunities to take a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSimultaneously, many parents are also supposed to be working from home with their own set of deadlines and work responsibilities. This sort of multitasking is highly stressful and puts a huge burden on the family unit,\u201d Beevers says. If you\u2019re still not sure how the pandemic has affected your mental health, you can use this checklist to get some clarity. The mental health impact on children and teens It isn\u2019t just adults who have experienced mental health effects. Children\u2019s mental health may have been affected by disruptions to their schoolwork, learning, and social lives. An estimated 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school closures. This left many feeling isolated and disoriented by the lack of school routine and the difficulties that come with remote learning. \u201cFor many students, online school has been an extreme challenge due to difficulty focusing and staying on task while attending school from home,\u201d explains Kristel Roper, LMFT, LPCC. \u201cStudents with ADHD or other conditions that can make learning difficult have been even more negatively affected by the recent changes.\u201d Because of the school closures, some children with extra developmental needs have been less likely to be noticed and have their needs addressed by their teachers. Myszak explains, \u201cChildren who would be identified in school as needing additional support may not be coming to the attention of the school, so they are not getting the services they need.\u201d There\u2019s also been an increase in reported thoughts of suicide and self-harm among young adults. A recent report from Mental Health America showed an increase in these thoughts, especially among LGBTQIA+ youth. Suicide prevention If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you\u2019re not alone. Help is available right now: You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255. Contact the teen-to-teen peer hotline Teen Line at 800-852-8336 or text TEEN to 839863. Not in the United States? You can find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide. Was this helpful? How has the pandemic affected people who already have a mental health condition? If you have an existing mental health condition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some symptoms worse. \u201cIndividuals with anxiety often benefit from increased structure, positive social interactions, and spending time engaging in valued activities,\u201d Roper explains. \u201cAll of these have been made much more difficult by the quarantine.\u201d In addition, physical distancing measures have made it more difficult for some people to find help when dealing with loss or substance use, as many mental health professionals and support groups moved online. According to the CDC, there was an 18.2% increase in overdose-related deaths that accelerated around the time stay-at-home orders were put in place. \u201cSome have referred to the pandemic as an \u2018accelerant\u2019 that has exposed or exacerbated many vulnerabilities in society,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cPeople who have experienced depression in the past or had mild symptoms leading into the pandemic were very likely at high risk for experiencing depression during the pandemic,\u201d he says. Tips to support your mental health through the pandemic Even as we continue to move forward, many people will be reeling and healing from the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While time may be part of the healing equation, there\u2019s a lot you can do now to take care of your mental health. And the rise of online therapy options has made professional mental healthcare more accessible for many people. Here are a few ways to care for your mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Create a daily routine Our daily work commute and office routine were some of the first things to change with the pandemic. If you once had a strict train, mealtime, or day care pickup schedule, staying at home was a real shake-up to your daily routine. That\u2019s why it can help to create a personal daily routine. \u201cI would highly recommend creating your own structure through a routine that you follow each day,\u201d Roper says. For example, it can be helpful to wake up and eat meals at the same time. Focus on reducing stress Making time to take care of yourself can help you better handle the stressors in your life. Like a car trying to run without gas, your capacity to deal with stress may be limited if your physical and mental health are running on empty. \u201cI always recommend starting [with] the basics: eating well and exercising,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cEven just a 15- to 30-minute walk each day can help ease stress and anxiety.\u201d And if you enjoy meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music and sounds, you might schedule time to engage in these activities. Set boundaries between work and home life When you were still working in the office or on location for your job, the act of physically clocking out and heading home was a natural way to transition out of your workday. But when you\u2019re working from home, it can be tough to leave the workday behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to set boundaries between work time and home time. For example, you could \u201ccommute\u201d to another room in your house to work, and leave that room (and work computer) behind when you end your day. If you have a home-based job with nonspecific hours, consider setting a regular work schedule to help prevent tasks from carrying over into your personal time. This can be especially true for parents working at home with their children. \u201cBeing able to turn off the computer, silence the phone, and engage in play and fun activities will speak volumes to children seeking attention,\u201d Myszak says. \u201cShowing children you are willing to spend time with them will be much more effective than anything you would say to them.\u201d Talk with a mental health professional Many resources are available to help you manage mental health challenges during the pandemic. Online therapy is becoming more popular, and it\u2019s proving effective for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you\u2019re interested in finding mental health support online, here are some free online therapy and support services and 10 free mental health apps to get started. Some local and national support groups can also help free of cost. While these alternatives may not be as personalized as one-on-one therapy, it can help to talk with a community of people who\u2019ve had similar experiences. These groups may also help if you\u2019re dealing with loneliness or isolation, because they allow you to interact and talk with people digitally. Mental Health America has also created an extensive list of support groups that can help you find support if you\u2019re dealing with mental health symptoms, domestic violence, or addiction. Be kind to yourself This idea gets repeated so often that it can be hard to remember what it truly means. Practicing kindness toward yourself can mean treating yourself like you\u2019d treat a loved one when you\u2019re feeling not so great. \u201cWe can be our own worst critics,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cA little self-compassion can go a long way towards feeling better. We are all doing the best that we can under incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d The COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s role in mental health Many people are feeling relief after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For them, it has helped lower anxiety about contracting the virus, being hospitalized, or dying as a result of the disease. Still, many people have been skeptical of the vaccine\u2019s accelerated rollout and possible side effects. This remains a real concern among some people in the United States. \u201cFor those who are wary of the vaccine, I always recommend doing your research,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is ask your own trusted healthcare team. They\u2019ll be able to share their professional opinions with your specific needs in mind.\u201d You can also talk with friends and family about their experiences during the pandemic and with the vaccine. Since so much of the pandemic was marked by distancing our relationships, there\u2019s great potential for healing as we start to slowly and safely reunite. \u201cFor many, the vaccine rollout has brought with it a collective sigh of relief,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cIt has also likely been highly emotional for many as we begin to see our loved ones, friends, neighbors, and communities get the vaccine and feel, for the first time in a while, that feeling of hope.\u201d",

        "text":"Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling. If this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time? Research on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt. These findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis? To find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all. People who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted. These findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Although we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood. Making your social media a more positive place Our research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content. But we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does. So what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable? We found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee\/Shutterstock One option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020. But how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible? Given that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive. Be mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think. Importantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health. As the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.

        "text":"Despite claims of anti-vaccine activists no different than groups that used to claim vaccines cause autism, COVID-19 vaccines do not impact fecundability\u2014the probability of conception per menstrual cycle\u2014in female or male partners who received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The prospective study instead indicates that COVID-19 infection among males may temporarily reduce fertility\u2014 an outcome that could be avoidable through vaccination. Lead author Dr. Amelia Wesselink, epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, and colleagues analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fecundability, among female and male participants in the BUSPH-based Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing NIH-funded study that enrolls women trying to conceive, and follows them from preconception through six months after delivery. Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021. The researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility. While COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction. \u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d The new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination.",

        "text":"Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom. But how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them. People are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates. Throughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication. Co-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video. The researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation. Similarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task. Three areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University Results of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition. There were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them. To simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior. \"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\" There was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face. Comparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions. \"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\"",

        "text":"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19. The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax. The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia. This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19? What\u2019s in the mix? Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself. All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question. We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response. The Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus. By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response. However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on. So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated. The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system. The spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided Rethinking an influenza vaccine The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu. The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus). In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine. An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age. This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial. Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza. These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza. So the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2? The Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock The Australian clinical trial The new phase I\/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response. Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms. The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M. All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot. This design enables researchers to ask four important questions: can the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough? While it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals. And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19. We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants. The Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.

Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division. Confusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy. If the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way. Similarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories. What to look out for Source. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly. Logo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website. Bad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions. Pretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this. Over-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works. Use fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media. Who to trust The best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles. Even government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields. A time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young\/EPA Charlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19. The effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19. Unfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable. We can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.

        "text":"December 21, 2023 expert reaction to UKHSA and ONS release latest Winter COVID-19 Infection Study data Scientists react to Winter COVID-19 infection study data released by UKHSA and ONS. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, UEA, said: \u201cOne of the most valuable surveys done during the pandemic was the ONS covid infection survey which sampled up to about 200,000 people every other week and provided some of the best estimates of how many people were infected at any one time, whether or not they had symptoms https:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-ons-has-published-its-final-covid-infection-survey-heres-why-its-been-such-a-valuable-resource-202589. This survey was suspended last March but has been restarted in collaboration with the UKHSA just for the winter months. \u201cToday the first results of the new survey have been published https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-estimates-of-epidemiological-characteristics-england-and-scotland-2023-to-2024. \u201cThe first thing to point out is that these estimates are prevalence estimates (i.e. the proportion of people who would test positive and NOT the number of new infections which will be about 10 fold lower). \u201cIt is no surprise that prevalence has been increasing since the last week of November as all the other indicators including hospital admissions and tests reported have also been showing this increase. It was expected that infections would rise towards the end of the year. But what the other indicators do not do is tell us how many people are currently infected with the virus. That is the value of this latest data. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know before is whether covid infections are more or less common than the same time last year and the year before that (figure 1). You can see that up till the end of November, infection rates were pretty much the same as the same time period in the previous two years. Since the start of the month infections this year have increased more than in previous years and by the 13th December were about 50% higher than last year (see figure 1). \u201cBut that is not the full story. Are covid infections causing as much harm as in previous years. The answer is no as measured by the number of people occupying hospital beds primarily because of covid. So although infections are higher this year than last they are putting less than half the patients in hospital (Figure 2). So on average someone catching covid this year is a lot less likely to end up in hospital because of it than last year and substantially less than in 2021. \u201cThe uncertainty is how high infections will go and when they will peak. Although a covid infection is much less likely to put you in hospital than a year ago, if infection rates go very high then this will put pressure on the NHS. Unfortunately it is too early to know this. I suspect that covid infections will peak early in January and hospital beds take up still won\u2019t be as high as last year by a significant margin, though we can\u2019t know that for certain. \u201cFurthermore, covid is not the only issue. In this week\u2019s influenza report National Influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2023-to-2024-seasoninfluenza infections are also increasing rapidly. The hospitalisation rate for influenza are close to the that of covid and are increasing more rapidly so may soon overtake that from covid.\u201d Figure 1 Figure 2 Prof Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics, Open University, said: \u201cWhat does the new Winter Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Study (WCIS) tell us about Covid infections in the UK? Well, the news isn\u2019t very encouraging at present, at least not for England and Scotland. (The study doesn\u2019t run in Wales or Northern Ireland.) But it\u2019s a new study, and there\u2019s still considerable uncertainty about some of the details. \u201cPublication of the WCIS results is, not very helpfully, split between ONS (Office for National Statistics) and UKHSA (UK Health Security Agency). I say more about the exact sources in a note at the end. \u201cI think that the most informative source of information comes from UKHSA. For the first time today, they have published results from their statistical modelling of the survey data produced by ONS. These UKHSA results use a statistical model that \u2018weights\u2019 the data to allow for the characteristics of the sample of people providing the data not being the same as the characteristics of the population in private households, and that also allows for possible errors in individual test results. (That is, false positives, where someone tests positive but is not in fact infected, and false negatives, where someone tests negative, but is in fact infected.) \u201cThe most recent data, for both the ONS and the UKHSA publications, is for 13 December, just over a week ago. There is always some delay in survey findings like these, because of the time taken to collect in the latest data and to analyse it statistically. \u201cUKHSA estimate that about one in every 24 people, aged over 2 and living in private households in England and Scotland, was infected with Covid-19 on 13 December. That\u2019s an increase of about 56% in the proportion of people infected, compared to their estimate for one week earlier. This indication of quite a substantial increase is consistent with the unweighted data from ONS (increase of 57% from the week ending 6 December to the week ending 13 December). It\u2019s also broadly consistent with indications of increase in hospitalisations involving Covid and with other data collated by UKHSA (for England) in their weekly surveillance bulletins, though the detailed numbers are not the same. \u201cAs always with results based on surveys and statistical modelling, there\u2019s some statistical uncertainty about this \u2013 the data are consistent with the number of infected people being anywhere between 1 in 19 and 1 in 30. There may also be other aspects of uncertainty that couldn\u2019t be allowed for in these calculations \u2013 but there\u2019s little doubt that infection rates have been increasing since late November. \u201cThis is a prevalence estimate \u2013 an estimate of the number of people who have a Covid infection on 13 December, whether they were first infected on that day, or had been infected already for a few days (or longer). UKHSA say they are planning to publish incidence results too, estimating the number of new infections on a given day, but they can\u2019t do that yet on the basis of the data they have so far. \u201cUKHSA also produce separate prevalence figures for England (again 1 in 24 infected, with uncertainty interval from 1 in 19 to 1 in 30), and Scotland (again about 1 in 24 infected, with uncertainty interval from 1 in 18 to 1 in 33). \u201cThere are results also for separate age groups and for different regions of England. \u201cFor age groups, the highest prevalence of infection (for England and Scotland together) on 13 December was for ages 18 to 34, and 35 to 44, with in both cases about 1 in 17 people infected. There\u2019s quite a lot of statistical uncertainty, though, because the numbers of people tested in these age groups is smaller than for all ages. For the 18 to 34 group, for instance, the true number could plausibly be anywhere between 1 in 13 and 1 in 24. \u201cFor other age groups, the estimates are lower, particularly for the oldest group considered (75 and over) where UKHSA estimate that about 1 in 50 had an infection on 13 December, with an uncertainty interval from 1 in 38 to 1 in 71. But rates have increased in all age groups since late November. \u201cFor the English regions, the estimated prevalence of infection has increased in all of them over the two weeks to 13 December, but particularly in London (estimated 1 in 16 infected on 13 December, uncertainty interval from 1 in 12 to 1 in 22) and in the South East (estimated 1 in 21 infected, uncertainty interval from 1 in 16 to 1 in 28), and to a rather smaller extent in the East of England (estimated 1 in 23 infected, uncertainty interval from 1 in 17 to 1 in 30). In all the other regions the estimate of prevalence for 13 December is between 1 in 26 and 1 in 29, though with quite wide uncertainty intervals.\u201d Further information \u201cNow some background, partly to explain why it is a bit early to be entirely confident about these results. They are all flagged as \u2018official statistics under development\u2019, which means that they are still being tested with users and that the details may change. \u201cDuring the heights of the Covid pandemic we were rather overwhelmed with data on how many people in the UK were getting infected, getting ill, going to hospital and, sadly, dying. It could be difficult to make sense of all that, and some data sources weren\u2019t very reliable for various reasons. \u201cBut one generally acknowledged statistical strength was the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS). Unlike other sources of information on how many people were infected, it used data from a reasonably representative sample of the population, made sensible statistical adjustments, and generally gave a good picture of how infections were progressing. \u201cSurveys of representative samples, like the CIS, were extremely uncommon in other parts of the world. In England, we were lucky enough to have two of them \u2013 the other set were the REACT surveys based at Imperial College \u2013 which allowed us to cross check between the two. \u201cAll that ended after March this year, when the funding for the CIS (and REACT) finished. But a new, somewhat similar, survey began to publish results two weeks ago. This is the Winter Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Study (WCIS), a joint piece of work by UKHSA and the ONS. The publication two weeks ago did not include the weighted results from the modelling undertaken by UKHSA. \u201cIt\u2019s not really possible to compare the prevalence results from the old CIS with those from the new WCIS. That\u2019s for several reasons, one main one being that the old survey (and also the REACT survey) used data from PCR tests, whereas the new WCIS uses data from lateral flow tests sent to the participants. The characteristics of the two types of test are not the same. UKHSA are aiming to allow for the error rates of the lateral flow tests in their statistical modelling, but it can\u2019t yet really be clear how well this is working. \u201cAlso, there will be differences between the way people are chosen to provide samples for the old and the new surveys, and in the statistical model used (by UKHSA for the new survey) to produce the weighted results. Details on exactly what is being done are a bit sparse so far \u2013 a publication on the methodology is promised for next month, and we\u2019ll know more then. I can say at the moment that the general approach in the statistical modelling seems appropriate and fairly standard, and is, in broad terms anyway, the same as was used with the CIS. But the devil can be in the detail, and we haven\u2019t seen the detail yet. \u201cThe old CIS didn\u2019t exist in isolation \u2013 there was also (for England) the REACT survey, with similar but certainly not identical methods, and there was also data based on routine testing and published on the Government dashboard, and results produced by a very different methodology from the ZOE study. \u201cBut now, REACT no longer runs. The dashboard figures were always subject, from time to time, to changes produced because more, or fewer, or different, people were choosing to be tested, or because of changes in the availability of tests, and not because of real underlying changes in infection rates. Since free routine testing has mostly ended, the figures from that source are less reliable than they were. The ZOE study was never as completely open about its methods, and although it still publishes Covid estimates, that are probably based on fewer responses from volunteers, and it\u2019s not clear (to me anyway) how reliable they are. \u201cSo with the old CIS, we could gain some confidence in its findings by seeing that, in broad terms, it was moving similarly to all these other sources of data, which it generally was. That just can\u2019t be done now, not in the same way at least. \u201cTherefore I can\u2019t yet be confident that the new results from the WCIS are entirely reliable. The people involved do know what they are doing, and what they are doing sounds broadly acceptable to me. But I think we need to giver a longer time, for the methods to settle down and possibly to be adjusted where necessary. That will happen \u2013 though probably not in time for the next data release, which will be on 11 January (with another promised for 18 January and then fortnightly after that).\u201d Sources \u201cNote that all this is still very new to me too \u2013 if I\u2019ve missed or misrepresented an important data source, please let me know. (kevin.mcconway@open.ac.uk) \u201cThe UKHSA publications associated with the WCIS are linked from https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-estimates-of-epidemiological-characteristics-england-and-scotland-2023-to-2024. Something similar to the information that used to be in the weekly ONS CIS bulletins is at https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-estimates-of-epidemiological-characteristics-england-and-scotland-2023-to-2024\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-estimates-of-epidemiological-characteristics-21-december-2023, though, in this first publication at least, it doesn\u2019t give so much of the helpful interpretation that used to be in the CIS bulletins. There is also a document explaining what and where all the publications are, https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-estimates-of-epidemiological-characteristics-england-and-scotland-2023-to-2024\/winter-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-study-publications-explained, and there\u2019s rather brief publication on methodology and quality, and a spreadsheet version of the numbers used in the explanatory report. \u201cThe UKHSA publications explain that, from some time in early 2024, they hope to publish estimates of incidence, that is, the numbers of people each day or each week who are newly becoming infected. The current results are for prevalence, that is, the numbers of people who are currently infected, regardless of whether they were first infected on the day in question or have already had an infection for some days (or longer). UKHSA also say that they may in future publish data on the risk of being hospitalised if one is infected, the risk of death after being infected, and possibly other things. But none of this can be available yet when there is still too much uncertainty about aspects of the data and of the statistical modelling. \u201cThe ONS data release on the WCIS is at https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/conditionsanddiseases\/datasets\/wintercoronaviruscovid19infectionstudyenglandandscotland. There is no explanatory bulletin, just some notes and usage information and a link to a spreadsheet containing the results. These results are estimated percentages of people in England and Scotland (together and separately) who would test positive, but without statistical weighting to allow for differences between the sample of people who provided the data and the known characteristics of the population. \u201cThe old Government coronavirus dashboard at https:\/\/coronavirus.data.gov.uk\/ is still available, though it has for a long time been confined to providing data for England and it is even longer since it was updated daily, as it used to be. However, today it says that it had its final update on 14 December, and that after 21 December we should instead use the UKHSA data dashboard. \u201cThe UKHSA data dashboard is at https:\/\/ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk\/. However, at the time of writing this (12.30 on 21 December 2023), this new dashboard still says \u201cAs the UKHSA data dashboard is still undergoing statistical review, do not use the dashboard data.\u201d Instead it tells us to use the old dashboard, and the weekly UKHSA surveillance report. Presumably this will all be updated at some point soon. The UKHSA dashboard presents data on some other respiratory viruses as well as Covid-19. That will be very useful, if and when it gets beyond the stage of telling us not to use it. \u201cUKHSA\u2019s weekly surveillance reviews, linked from https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2023-to-2024-season, present data on influenza, Covid-19, some other respiratory diseases, and on what is known as \u2018influenza-like illness\u2019 (ILI), a term for illnesses that have some of the characteristics of influenza but which may or may not actually be caused by an influenza virus. Because it puts together data from a variety of different sources, it can present a pretty comprehensive version of what is going on. But it applies only to England. Similar surveillance goes on in the other UK countries, and is published by their health authorities.\u201d https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/ukhsa-and-ons-release-latest-winter-covid-19-infection-study-data Declared interests Prof Paul Hunter: \u201cI have no conflicts of interest.\u201d Prof Kevin McConway: \u201cI am a Trustee of the SMC and a member of its Advisory Committee.

        "text":"December 14, 2023 expert reaction to study showing that the decline in smoking in England has stalled since the pandemic A study published in BMC Medicine looks at the decline in smoking in England since the pandemic. Prof Caitlin Notley, Professor of Addiction Sciences, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, said: \u201cThis research report indicates a slowing in the decline of smoking prevalence in England. The smoking toolkit study is a robust and invaluable source of epidemiological data and is one of our key indicators of population trends. The study reveals some interesting findings, such as an increase in smoking quit attempts during the pandemic, but little change in smoking prevalence overall. This may be due to increased uptake of smoking by younger adults during the pandemic, off-setting increases in quitting behaviour by older adults. \u201cThis is a concern. In this generation we have seen cuts in funding to public health anti-smoking campaigns, but intense media focus on other nicotine containing products such as e-cigarettes, and some alarmist reporting. Unfortunately this may be contributing to inaccurate harm perceptions, such that approximately half of people who continue to smoke incorrectly believe vaping is at least as harmful as smoking. Young people may incorrectly believe smoking and vaping to be equivalent in harm. \u201cTo drive down rates of tobacco smoking we must invest in public health campaigns to inform people accurately that vaping is an effective smoking cessation aid and substantially less harmful than smoking tobacco. New government proposals to increase funding for anti-smoking campaigns, increase the age of sale, and a pledge to make a million vape kits available to support people who smoke to switch, are welcome and needed to meet the smokefree 2030 target.\u201d Dr Leonie Brose, Reader in Addiction Education and Nicotine Research, King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThis is a very well-conducted analysis of changes in smoking and cessation in England between 2017 and 2022, looking particularly at changes coinciding with the COVID pandemic. It found that while cessation increased among adults who smoked, smoking increased among young adults. When attempting to explain the reasons behind this increase, earlier findings from the same survey1 are useful. They showed that mental health, particularly in young adults, has deteriorated substantially. By the end of 2022, 20% of 18\u201324-year-olds reported a level of distress serious enough to suggest mental health treatment was needed. Poorer mental health is closely associated with increased smoking; addressing the causes of the high and increasing levels of poor mental health among young people is crucial and could also be expected to help reduce smoking prevalence.\u201d 1 of which I am an author \u2018Have there been sustained impacts of the COVID\u201119 pandemic on trends in smoking prevalence, uptake, quitting, use of treatment, and relapse?

        "link":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/gravitational-waves-detection-lasers-atoms",
        "text":"Until recently, gravitational waves could have been a figment of Einstein\u2019s imagination. Before they were detected, these ripples in spacetime existed only in the physicist\u2019s general theory of relativity, as far as scientists knew. Now, researchers have not one but two ways to detect the waves. And they\u2019re on the hunt for more. The study of gravitational waves is booming, says astrophysicist Karan Jani of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. \u201cThis is just remarkable. No field I can think of in fundamental physics has seen progress this fast.\u201d Just as light comes in a spectrum, or a variety of wavelengths, so do gravitational waves. Different wavelengths point to different types of cosmic origins and require different flavors of detectors. Gravitational waves with wavelengths of a few thousand kilometers \u2014 like those detected by LIGO in the United States and its partners Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan \u2014 come mostly from merging pairs of black holes 10 or so times the mass of the sun, or from collisions of dense cosmic nuggets called neutron stars (SN: 2\/11\/16). These detectors could also spot waves from certain types of supernovas \u2014 exploding stars \u2014 and from rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars (SN: 5\/6\/19). In contrast, immense ripples that span light-years are thought to be created by orbiting pairs of whopper black holes with masses billions of times that of the sun. In June, scientists reported the first strong evidence for these types of waves by turning the entire galaxy into a detector, watching how the waves tweaked the timing of regular blinks from pulsars scattered throughout the Milky Way (SN: 6\/28\/23). With the equivalent of both small ripples and major tsunamis in hand, physicists now hope to plunge into a vast, cosmic ocean of gravitational waves of all sorts of sizes. These ripples could reveal new details about the secret lives of exotic objects such as black holes and unknown facets of the cosmos. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of gaps in our coverage of the gravitational wave spectrum,\u201d says physicist Jason Hogan of Stanford University. But it makes sense to cover all the bases, he says. \u201cWho knows what else we might find?\u201d This quest to capture the full complement of the universe\u2019s gravitational waves could take observatories out into deep space or the moon, to the atomic realm and elsewhere. Here\u2019s a sampling of some of the frontiers scientists are eyeing in search of new types of waves. Go to deep space The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, sounds implausible at first. A trio of spacecraft, arranged in a triangle with 2.5-million-kilometer sides, would beam lasers to one another while cartwheeling in an orbit around the sun. But the European Space Agency mission, planned for the mid-2030s, is no mere fantasy (SN: 6\/20\/17). It is many scientists\u2019 best hope for breaking into new realms of gravitational waves. \u201cLISA is a mind-blowing experiment,\u201d says theoretical physicist Diego Blas Temi\u00f1o of Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and Institut de F\u00edsica d\u2019Altes Energies. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, will be made up of a trio of spacecraft orbiting the sun (illustrated in foreground). LISA will observe gravitational waves from orbiting supermassive black holes in distant galaxies (illustrated in background). Simon Barke\/University of Florida ( CC BY 4.0 As a gravitational wave passes by, LISA would detect the stretching and squeezing of the sides of the triangle, based on how the laser beams interfere with each other at the triangle\u2019s corners. A proof-of-concept experiment with a single spacecraft, LISA Pathfinder, flew in 2015 and demonstrated the feasibility of the technique (SN: 6\/7\/16). Generally, to catch longer wavelengths of gravitational waves, you need a bigger detector. LISA would let scientists see wavelengths millions of kilometers long. That means LISA could detect orbiting black holes that would be enormous, but moderately so \u2014 millions of times the mass of the sun instead of billions. Go to the moon With NASA\u2019s Artemis program aiming at a return to the moon, scientists are looking to Earth\u2019s neighbor for inspiration (SN: 11\/16\/22). A proposed experiment called the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, or LILA, would put a gravitational wave detector on the moon. Without the jostling of human activity and other earthly jitters, gravitational waves should be easier to pick out on the moon. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a spiritual quietness,\u201d Jani says. \u201cIf you want to listen to the sounds of the universe, these is no place better in the solar system than our moon.\u201d Like LISA, LILA would have three stations beaming lasers in a triangle, though the sides of this one would be about 10 kilometers long. It could catch wavelengths tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers long. That would fill in a gap between the wavelengths measured by the space-based LISA and the Earth-based LIGO. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna, LILA, is a proposed gravitational wave detector on the moon. Thanks to the moon\u2019s paltry atmosphere, LILA\u2019s triangle of lasers (illustrated) wouldn\u2019t need to be enclosed in vacuum tubes, unlike similar observatories on Earth. Vanderbilt Lunar Labs\/Vanderbilt University Because orbiting objects like black holes speed up as they get closer to merging, over time they emit gravitational waves with shorter and shorter wavelengths. That means LILA could watch black holes close in on one another during the weeks before they merge, giving scientists a heads-up that a collision is about to go down. Then, once the wavelengths get short enough, earthly observatories like LIGO would pick up the signal, catching the moment of impact. A different moon-based option would use lunar laser ranging \u2014 a technique by which scientists measure the distance from Earth to the moon with lasers, thanks to reflectors placed on the moon\u2019s surface during previous moon landings. The method could detect waves jostling the Earth and the moon, with wavelengths in between those seen by pulsar timing methods and LISA, Blas Temi\u00f1o and a colleague reported in Physical Review D in 2022. But that technique would require improved reflectors on the moon \u2014 another reason to go back. Go atomic LISA, LIGO and other laser observatories measure the stretching and squeezing of gravitational waves by monitoring how laser beams interfere after traversing their detectors\u2019 long arms. But a proposed technique goes a different route. Rather than looking for slight changes in the lengths of detector arms as gravitational waves pass, this new technique keeps an eye on the distance between two clouds of atoms. The quantum properties of atoms mean that they act like waves that can interfere with themselves. If a gravitational wave passes through, it changes the distance between the atom clouds. Scientists can tease out that change in distance based on that quantum interference. The technique could reveal gravitational waves with wavelengths between those detectable by LIGO and LISA, Hogan says. He\u2019s part of an effort to build a prototype detector, called MAGIS-100, at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. A new type of gravitational wave detector could be based on clouds of atoms. The MAGIS-100 prototype (part of the apparatus pictured) is currently in the works to test this technology. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Atom interferometers have never been used to measure gravitational waves, though they can sense Earth\u2019s gravity and test fundamental physics rules (SN: 2\/28\/22; SN: 10\/28\/20). The idea is \u201ctotally futuristic,\u201d Blas Temi\u00f1o says. Go back in time Another effort aims to pinpoint gravitational waves from the earliest moments of the universe. Such waves would have been produced during inflation, the moments after the Big Bang when the universe ballooned in size. These waves would have longer wavelengths than ever seen before \u2014 as long as 1021 kilometers, or 1 sextillion kilometers. But the hunt got off to a false start in 2014, when scientists with the BICEP2 experiment proclaimed the detection of gravitational waves imprinted in swirling patterns on the oldest light in the universe, the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. The claim was later overturned (SN: 1\/30\/15). An effort called CMB-Stage 4 will continue the search, with plans for multiple new telescopes that would scour the universe\u2019s oldest light for signs of the waves \u2014 this time, hopefully, without any missteps. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (data from the Planck satellite shown) could reveal gravitational waves stirred up just after the Big Bang. Planck Collaboration\/ESA Go for the unknown For most types of gravitational waves that scientists have set their sights on, they know a bit about what to expect. Known objects \u2014 like black holes or neutron stars \u2014 can create those waves. But for gravitational waves with the shortest wavelengths, perhaps just centimeters long, \u201cthe story is different,\u201d says theoretical physicist Valerie Domcke of CERN near Geneva. \u201cWe have no known source \u2026 that would actually give us [these] gravitational waves of a large enough amplitude that we could realistically detect them.\u201d Still, physicists want to check if the tiny waves are out there. These ripples could be produced by violent events early in the universe\u2019s history such as phase transitions, in which the cosmos converts from one state to another, akin to water condensing from steam into liquid. Another possibility is tiny, primordial black holes, too small to be formed by standard means, which might have been born in the early universe. Physics in these regimes is so poorly understood, \u201ceven looking for [gravitational waves] and not finding them would tell us something,\u201d Domcke says. These gravitational waves are so mysterious that their detection techniques are also up in the air. But the wavelengths are small enough that they could be seen with high-precision, laboratory-scale experiments, rather than enormous detectors. Scientists might even be able to repurpose data from experiments designed with other goals in mind. When gravitational waves encounter electromagnetic fields, the ripples can behave in ways similar to hypothetical subatomic particles called axions (SN: 3\/17\/22). So experiments searching for those particles might also reveal mini gravitational waves. The gamut of gravitational waves Gravitational waves come in a spectrum of shorter and longer wavelengths. Each wavelength range is generated by different sources. Pulsars and exploding stars, or supernovas, generate some short wavelength ripples. Other waves are produced by pairs of neutron stars, or by pairs of stellar mass black holes, with masses less than 100 times that of the sun. Still longer wavelengths are generated by pairs of supermassive black holes. Different wavelengths can be spotted using different types of detectors, including ground-based detectors such as LIGO, space-based detectors such as LISA, and measurements of blips from dead stars called pulsars. Especially long wavelengths may be detected by studying the light released shortly after the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background. Other detector types (not pictured) could fill in the gaps. C. Chang C. Chang Source: NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab A new view Catching gravitational waves is like paddling against the tide: tough going, but worth it for the scenic views. \u201cGravitational waves are really, really hard to detect,\u201d Hogan says. It took decades of work before LIGO spotted its first swells, and the same is true of the pulsar timing technique. But astronomers immediately began reaping the rewards. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new view of the universe,\u201d Hogan says. Already, gravitational waves have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, discover a new class of black holes of moderately sized masses and unmask the fireworks that happen when two ultradense objects called neutron stars collide (SN: 2\/11\/16; SN: 9\/2\/20; SN: 10\/16\/17). And it\u2019s still early days for gravitational wave detection. Scientists can only guess at what future detectors will expose. \u201cThere\u2019s way more to discover,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIt\u2019s bound to be interesting.\u201d",

        "text":"WASHINGTON D.C. \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges. But for scientists studying teen brains, it was a chance to explore how adolescents handle stressful times. Brain scans taken before the pandemic turned up factors that seemed to predict how teens\u2019 mental health fared during the pandemic. These findings may help explain why some people are better able to deal with stress. Researchers presented their results here, November 13, at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. A lot of research focuses on impacts at a single point in time, says Margot Wagner. A bioengineer, she works at the University of California, San Diego and did not take part in the new work. This study, she notes, followed hundreds of teens over time. That let scientists spot brain features that were connected to later outcomes. She says it also now suggests that \u201cyou can intervene and help way sooner than otherwise.\u201d The pandemic was tough on many kids. They experienced isolation, worry and big changes to daily life. Scientists are now identifying longer-term impacts \u2014 a record number of teens struggling with depression and anxiety. Some scientists call this mental-health crisis \u201cthe second pandemic.\u201d Even as many teenagers struggled during the pandemic, others did okay. Caterina Stamoulis wanted to know why. A computational neuroscientist, she works at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts. Stamoulis used data collected as part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, also known as ABCD. It collected data at 21 research sites across the United States. By studying more than 11,000 adolescents, scientists are learning how a teen\u2019s brain grows and matures. \u201cThis is the first time in history we\u2019re looking at thousands of participants and getting these measures over time,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cIt\u2019s truly remarkable.\u201d Scanning for the pandemic effect Scientists scanned the brains of 1,414 teens for the ABCD study. They used functional MRI brain scans, or fMRI. These measure blood flow in the brain. Active areas show more blood flow. These images also help reveal how certain parts of the brain work together. Neuroscientists call such links brain circuits. Begun in 2015, ABCD was well underway when COVID hit. That meant researchers had brain scans from before the pandemic. They could compare brain circuits from back then with the teens\u2019 later responses to stress. \u201cWithout the pandemic, we would not have been able to understand the impact of a long-lasting adverse event,\u201d Stamoulis notes. In May 2020, as the world shut down, researchers started surveying teens in the study about how they were doing. They surveyed them every few months. The responses measured aspects of mental health, stress and sadness, among other things.

There was a problem signing you up. Before the pandemic, some teens had weaker neural links between certain parts of the brain. These teens fared worse than those with stronger links, the team found. Affected brain regions included the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. The prefrontal cortex is a brain area right behind the forehead. It gets drastically reshaped during adolescence. The amygdala is a structure inside each side of the brain. It helps process emotions. The data show that kids with weaker links between these areas were more likely to feel sad and stressed during the pandemic, Stamoulis reports. \u201cStronger and more resilient brain networks predicted better mental health, lower stress and lower sadness.\u201d Researchers don\u2019t yet know why some teens\u2019 brain networks are stronger. Stamoulis and her colleagues plan to study these brain circuits over time. As our brains develop, they respond to many experiences and factors in our surroundings. If those are positive, Stamoulis says, they can be \u201cprotective factors for the brain and how its circuits evolve and become wired.\u201d",

        "text":"To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences. The panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research. Download the full report Executive Summary As with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists. The physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point. If we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous. The physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.

        "text":"Elisabeth Mahase The BMJ Just over 4% of people in England and Scotland\u2014around one in 24\u2014may have had covid-19 last week, says the latest release from the Winter Coronavirus Infection Study.1 Data released by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed that on 13 December the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 4.3% (95% credible interval 3.3% to 5.4%) in England and 4.1% (3.0% to 5.6%) in Scotland. This is a sharp rise from the estimated 1.8% prevalence seen at the end of November. The highest rates were seen in people aged 18 to 44, and London was the region worst affected. The study collects as many as 30 000 self-reported lateral flow test results every week, as well as questionnaire responses, from around 150 000 participants in England and Scotland. Steven Riley, UKHSA director general for data and surveillance, said, \u201cAt this time of year the cold weather, shorter days, and increased socialising mean that the potential for transmission of respiratory viruses like covid-19 is particularly high. This, as well as the possible impact of new variants, means it\u2019s not unexpected to see cases increasing.\u201d This week the World Health Organization highlighted a new covid variant of interest: JN.1, an offshoot of the omicron subvariant BA.2.86. While the new variant was described by WHO as \u201clow\u201d risk, UKHSA said that it now made up around 7% of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2.2 \u201cChock-a-block\u201d wards The infection update came as NHS England warned that the number of people in hospital with flu had also increased by almost two thirds in just a week, from an average of 402 patients a day to 648 a day. This is four times higher than the average of 160 seen at the end of November. Hospital admissions with covid have also risen by 12% in a week\u2014from 3024 on 10 December to 3390 on 17 December\u2014and norovirus cases in hospital have increased by 10%, from an average of 506 patients a day to 566 a day. Meanwhile, last week saw almost 50 000 NHS staff absences each day. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, commented, \u201cThere\u2019s pressure right through the system, from chock-a-block hospital wards to a rising number of staff off work sick, on top of more than 121 000 vacancies across England in hospital, ambulance, mental health and community trusts\u2014at a time when many staff are off on planned leave.\u201d Cordery added that the three day strike by junior doctors this week and the upcoming, record long strike action planned for January would add to this \u201csignificant pressure.\u201d3 She said, \u201cWe urge the government and unions to get back round the negotiating table now to hammer out a deal that will end the junior doctors\u2019 strikes and take the extra strain off staff, services, and patients.\u201d This article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "text":"Gareth Iacobucci The BMJ Health officials have emphasised the importance of vaccination against respiratory illnesses this winter, as latest figures show that England is seeing increased rates of flu and covid-19.1 The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has also advised that antiviral medicine would be suitable for some patients presenting with influenza-like illness in hospitals or at GP surgeries, given the current rates. In the week of 4-10 December UKHSA\u2019s laboratory surveillance data showed that influenza positivity in England rose to 5.6%, from 2.4% the previous week. Figures from primary care suggested a rise in consultations for influenza-like illness to 5.3 in 100 000, which is up from 4.6 in 100 000 the previous week but within the baseline activity level range. Hospital admissions for flu increased from 0.86 in 100 000 to 2.14 in 100 000 and crossed from baseline levels into the \u201clow impact\u201d range. Flu admissions to intensive care units or high dependency units also rose sharply, with 35 new admissions, but remained within baseline levels. Risk and complications Emergency department attendances for influenza-like illness have increased nationwide, UKHSA said. While flu vaccine uptake in the 2023-24 season is currently higher than the same period last year in 2-3 year olds, it is lower in over 65s, pregnant women, and people under 65 in clinical risk groups. Mary Ramsay, UKHSA\u2019s director of public health programmes, said, \u201cFlu levels are starting to rise, so get your vaccine now to get winter strong. Pregnant women, their unborn babies, and those in clinical risk groups are at higher risk of complication from flu. \u201cTaking up both the flu and covid-19 vaccines provides the best protection for both pregnant women and their baby, reducing the risk of severe complications, intensive care needs, stillbirth, and prematurity.\u201d In a letter to health professionals England\u2019s chief medical officer and chief pharmaceutical officer wrote that, in accordance with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, GPs and pharmacists \u201cmay now supply antiviral medicines (oseltamivir and zanamivir) for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza at NHS expense.\u201d These medicines \u201cmay be prescribed for patients in clinical at-risk groups as well as anyone at risk of severe illness and\/or complications from influenza if not treated,\u201d they added. Covid spreads Data also show that covid rates are increasing in most regions, ethnicities, and age groups in England. In the week ending 10 December data from \u201cpillar 1,\u201d which mainly includes tests done in hospitals, showed 2639 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases, up 34.6% from the previous week. UKHSA laboratory data show a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 positivity, rising to 7.5% from 6.4% the previous week. Hospital admissions for covid-19 showed a slight increase to 3.80 in 100 000 in the week ending 10 December, up from 2.96 in 100 000 the previous week. Admissions were highest in people over 85. Thomas Waite, deputy chief medical officer for England, said, \u201cThe latest data indicates the flu season is very much under way and covid-19 infections are increasing. The use of antivirals against flu in primary care will help protect the most vulnerable over the winter. If you are eligible and have not managed to get vaccinated yet, now is the time.\u201d This article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "text":"Zaki Arshad , foundation year 2 doctor 1 2, Joshua Nazareth , NIHR academic clinical fellow 1 2 3 4, Manish Pareek , chair in infectious diseases 1234 1Department of Infection and HIV Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UK 2Department of Respiratory Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK 3NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, UK 4Development Centre for Population Health, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK Public interest in covid-19 is waning, but testing, vaccination, and mask wearing remain important to curbing the pandemic over winter, write Zaki Arshad, Joshua Nazareth, and Manish Pareek With a fall in covid-19 mortality and hospital admission rates over the past two years,1 public interest in the pandemic has reduced.12 However, SARS-CoV-2 remains in widespread circulation.2 As we approach winter, a period associated with increased strain on our NHS, what can we expect from the covid-19 pandemic, and how can we prepare? As temperatures in the UK fall, we are seeing a steady increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, in keeping with patterns seen with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.23 SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was almost five times greater in September 2023, compared with June and July.2 This has coincided with the emergence of new variants, such as BA.2.86, named \u201cPirola\u201d and JN.1.45 Early data suggest that BA.2.86 has higher angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor binding affinity than previous omicron variants, which may be associated with increased transmissibility.4 Accurately predicting future trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection and tracking the emergence of new variants is difficult and made even more challenging by declines in testing in the UK. During January 2022, more than one million SARS-CoV-2 test results were reported daily, but this figure is now less than 5000.2 This scaling back in national testing, in addition to the end of community surveillance studies and waste water monitoring, means increased uncertainty about SARS-CoV-2 activity.6 Encouragingly, the UK Health Security Agency has announced a temporary increase in testing and community surveillance until March 2024. Recent increases in SARS-CoV-2 infections throughout the year, not just during winter, highlight the need for longer term surveillance of the virus.6 With an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections likely over the coming months, the question of how we tackle this is important. The vaccination programme has played a critical role in reducing severity of infection.7 The government has introduced an \u201cautumn booster\u201d programme targeted at populations most at risk.8 Unlike previous booster campaigns, adults aged 50-64 years, a group comprising roughly one fifth of the UK population, will not be eligible. This represents a drastic scaling back of the booster programme.8 This is the first time a cost-benefit analysis has been used to decide eligibility.9 But numbers needed to vaccinate focus on preventing hospital admissions without reference to other costs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2014for example, health worker absenteeism and long covid. Although 77.7% of the UK adult population eligible for a fourth vaccination received a fourth dose, less than half of eligible 18\u201339 year olds received their fourth dose, with similarly low uptake among certain ethnic and lower socioeconomic groups.1011 Interventions aimed at engaging these groups, with the support of trusted leaders in the community, are needed to tackle concerns around vaccination and emphasise its benefits, to increase uptake. In addition to groups at increased clinical risk, vaccination of health and social care workers is important. Although uptake of first and second dose covid-19 vaccines among health and social care workers was around 80%, only 42.1% received a booster between September 2022 and February 2023.1213 Influenza vaccination for these workers has also declined from 60.5% in the 2021-22 season, to 49.9% in 2022-23.12 Substantial variation in uptake of covid-19 and influenza vaccination in healthcare workers is seen between NHS trusts.12 Given the extent of variation, it is likely some role in vaccine uptake is played by local trust based vaccination promotion schemes. Therefore, we can look to trusts with the highest uptake to learn lessons about how promotion schemes can be effective. Although recommendations on NHS covid-19 booster eligibility are guided by cost effectiveness, this does not affect private vaccination. Almost 85 000 private influenza vaccines were administered at one nationwide pharmacy chain in 2012-13.14 This suggests a strong appetite for influenza vaccination in people not eligible through NHS programmes. Given the similarities in eligibility between NHS seasonal influenza and covid-19 booster programmes, a similar demand for private vaccination likely exists for covid-19.815 Government and vaccine manufacturers have discussed private accessibility of covid-19 vaccines, but this dialogue has not progressed.16 And we should be mindful that such private schemes could widen health inequalities in uptake that are already seen with the covid-19 booster offered on the NHS.17 Face masks are effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses.18 Previously, use of masks was required in public spaces, but this has now been replaced with guidance outlining when to \u201cconsider\u201d use. This guidance places the onus on people and organisations to implement their own policies.19 For example, with the recent spike in cases, some NHS trusts have reintroduced a requirement for mask wearing in clinical areas. But this is not a nationwide policy, which may cause confusion for patients and staff. A nationwide mask wearing policy in certain high risk areas such as healthcare spaces, in response to increases in health and social care worker absenteeism or community prevalence rates, may be more effective.20 This is especially important given our decreased ability to respond to a surge in cases caused by declines in testing. The repeated emergence of new variants and a recent increase in cases should serve as a reminder that\u2014while we are adapting to live with covid-19\u2014caution is required.2 Surveillance studies, mask wearing, and vaccination, which played critical roles in the initial stages of the pandemic, must continue to be employed effectively to tackle this continuing global health challenge.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/383\/bmj.p2975",
        "text":"Mun-Keat Looi The BMJ The World Health Organization has added a new covid-19 strain, JN.1, to its list of \u201cvariants of interest,\u201d its second highest level of monitoring. Itself an offshoot of the omicron subvariant BA.2.86 (nicknamed \u201cPirola\u201d by the media),1 JN.1 is described by WHO as posing a \u201clow\u201d risk to global public health. The agency warned, however, that the winter season in the northern hemisphere could increase the burden of respiratory infections in many countries. Having made up just 3% of infections in early November, JN.1 is now responsible for over 27%, WHO said.2 JN.1 was first detected in 12 countries in September, the highest proportions being in Canada, France, Singapore, Sweden, the UK, and the US. The UK Health Security Agency has told the BBC that JN.1 is found in about 7% of the positive covid-19 tests analysed.3 Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that JN.1 is the fastest growing covid strain in the US, responsible for 15-29% of new covid infections.4 It is already the dominant strain in the north east of the US, where it is responsible for a third of all cases.5 T Ryan Gregory, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s already pretty clear that it is highly competitive with existing XBB variants and looks like it\u2019s on track to become the next sort of globally dominant group of variants.\u201d Current vaccines The US CDC said that there was only a single change between JN.1 and BA.2.86 in the spike protein on the virus\u2019s surface, which helps the virus infect people.6 Since the spike protein is also the part that existing vaccines target, current vaccines should work against JN.1 and BA.2.86. The CDC said, \u201cInitial scientific data show that the updated 2023-2024 covid-19 vaccines help our immune systems block BA.2.86. We expect JN.1 will be similar. We also expect treatments and testing to remain effective based on analysis conducted by the SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (a group of scientific experts representing many government agencies).\u201d WHO has emphasised that current vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and death from JN.1 and other circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2\u2014the virus that causes covid-19\u2014and has urged people to stay up to date with their vaccinations, particularly those at high risk of disease. The UN agency also warned that covid-19 was not the only respiratory disease circulating. Flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and common childhood pneumonia were on the rise, it said, reminding people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly, cover any coughs and sneezes, and stay at home if sick. Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist, said that JN.1 \u201chas become the fastest growing variant in the past two years,\u201d adding that public wastewater indications showed that the strain was exponentially increasing.7 \u201cThe big question is if and how hospitalizations will follow wastewater trends, especially in places like the US, where vaccination rates are low,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe UK and Singapore, which have high vaccination rates, are seeing a steep increase in hospitalizations now that JN.1 has taken over.\u201d Jetelina told the Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s coming at the same exact time in which our social networks are expanding as we travel and visit with people we don\u2019t normally see. I don\u2019t think it means we need to cancel our holidays . . . It certainly isn\u2019t going to be a tsunami like we saw with omicron. It\u2019s just less than optimal timing.\u201d Footnotes Katelyn Jetelina was a BMJ editor from 2020 to 2022.

The efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients who are immunocompromised should be investigated further.",

        "text":"Our study included a substantial proportion of patients with underlying immunosuppression. Similar to previous findings, 25 we found that these patients with covid-19 have a worse prognosis, as seen in the usual care group. Several studies have suggested that convalescent plasma might be particularly effective in patients who lack an immune response, particularly a humoral response. We reported previously that treatment with covid-19 convalescent plasma was associated with a favourable outcome in patients who were immunosuppressed (mainly B cell haematological malignancies treated with anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibodies). 6 Further evidence was provided by two independent exposed and non-exposed studies with propensity score in patients with underlying immunosuppression. Hazard ratios of 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.92) and 0.50 (0.34 to 0.72) were reported in favour of convalescent plasma treatment, respectively. 6 7 This reduction in mortality was similar to patients with immunosuppression randomised to the convalescent plasma group in the CORIPLASM trial. The lack of efficacy associated with covid-19 convalescent plasma agrees with the results of most prospective randomised clinical trials of patients admitted to hospital for covid-19 disease. 19 Only a small number of randomised studies have reported better survival after treatment with convalescent plasma, 20 21 whereas several other trials, notably the large RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial, 22 found no evidence of survival benefit with convalescent plasma. Large retrospective studies in the US reported evidence of reduced mortality associated with treatment with covid-19 convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. 23 24 The reasons for these discrepancies might be related to the characteristics of the convalescent plasma, time to treatment from first symptoms, treatment modalities, and patient characteristics. In this CORIPLASM trial, we found no difference in early outcomes between the covid-19 convalescent plasma and usual care groups for patients admitted to hospital for covid-19 disease not requiring assisted ventilation. The survival rate at day 14 and day 28 was higher in the convalescent plasma group but this finding was not significant. Comparison with other studies Most other randomised trials published so far did not report subgroup analyses for patients with underlying immunosuppression. One exception is the REMAP-CAP (Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community Acquired Pneumonia) trial that investigated convalescent plasma in critically ill patients with covid-19.22 Although the overall results of this study did not provide evidence of the efficacy of covid-19 convalescent plasma in these patients, a prespecified subgroup analysis showed a potential benefit of convalescent plasma in patients with immunodeficiency. Another randomised trial performed in patients with a diverse range of clinical conditions reported a significant effect of covid-19 convalescent plasma on clinical improvement and survival in the subgroup of 56 individuals with cancer.26 Finally, a meta-analysis incorporating the CORIPLASM trial has confirmed the potential benefit of covid-19 convalescent plasma in individuals with immunosuppression with mild-to-moderate covid-19 disease, based on greater statistical power because of the large number of individuals with immunosuppression included in the meta-analysis (1487 from randomised trials, 265 from case series, and 368 from cohorts).27 An antibody dose effect has been reported in several randomised studies3 28 as well as in the early access programme in the US.23 In the CORIPLASM trial, 800-880 mL of covid-19 convalescent plasma were transfused to patients randomised to the convalescent plasma group. In most studies so far, patients most often received 250-500 mL of convalescent plasma, except in the CAPSID (A Clinical Trial of Convalescent Plasma Compared to Best Supportive Care for Treatment of Patients With Severe Covid-19) trial where patients received 700-750 mL of convalescent plasma.24 28 The CAPSID trial reported a significant antibody dose effect for several outcomes, including survival at day 28. By contrast, the CORIPLASM protocol recommended four covid-19 convalescent plasma units provided by different donors for each patient, which resulted in less variation in mean antibody content in transfused convalescent plasma from patient to patient. This difference in transfusion practice might explain why we did not see an antibody dose effect in our study. Furthermore, convalescent plasma for the CORIPLASM study was collected early in the covid-19 crisis when vaccination was not available and before the occurrence of relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Several studies have shown that plasma provided by convalescent donors who were vaccinated strongly increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and seroneutralisation ratios and also increased cross reactivity with a broader spectrum for variants to which the donor had not been exposed.12 29 High titre plasma from these convalescent donors who were vaccinated might have increased clinical efficacy. Early intervention with covid-19 convalescent plasma has been associated with improved outcome.3 4 Patients in our study had a median duration of symptoms of seven days at the time of inclusion, a short time period compared with most trials of patients admitted to hospital. Prespecified subgroup analyses, however, did not favour increased efficacy of convalescent plasma associated with a shorter time since onset of symptoms. The high number of patients with underlying immunosuppression, for whom seroconversion is not expected early on, might have contributed to this finding. Also, and as found in other covid-19 trials, early admission to hospital might be associated with more severe disease.8 22 Patients in the covid-19 convalescent plasma group tended to have worsening pulmonary clinical conditions than patients in the usual care group early after transfusion. The occurrence of early transient pulmonary worsening after transfusion of convalescent plasma has also been reported elsewhere,30 and might be related to antibody dependent enhancement involving immune complex mediated inflammatory immunopathology in infected tissues.31 Also, an antibody dependent Fc receptor mediated infection of tissues macrophages (and circulating monocytes) might result in a massive inflammatory response, as recently reported,32 which could also contribute to pulmonary worsening after transfusion of convalescent plasma. These early outcomes are seldom reported in clinical studies, and distinguishing early pulmonary worsening from transfusion associated circulatory overload, transfusion related acute lung injury, or overall disease worsening, possibly started before transfusion, can be challenging. The transfusion of four units of plasma might have contributed to circulatory overload in some patients. Further spacing of administration of convalescent plasma (ie, 1 unit\/day over four days) could reduce this risk. Early worsening did not prevent subsequent improvement and increased survival as early as day 14 after randomisation, although this effect was not significant. Antibody mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages triggering inflammatory cell death and inhibition of viral replication might be a mechanism for subsequent improvement in disease.33",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/383\/bmj-2023-076990",
        "text":"In this large register based cohort study including 589 722 residents from the two largest regions of Sweden, we found a strong association between vaccination before first registered covid-19 and a reduced risk of receiving a diagnosis of PCC. In the study population, unvaccinated individuals had an almost fourfold higher proportion of PCC diagnoses compared with those who were vaccinated before infection (1.4% v 0.4%). We found a vaccine effectiveness against PCC of 58% for any dose within the primary vaccination series (ie, the first two doses and the first booster dose administered within the recommended schedule) given before a first registered infection. Vaccine effectiveness increased with each dose in the series: 21% for one dose, 59% for two doses, and 73% for three or more doses. Findings in context The few earlier studies on vaccine effectiveness against the long term effects of covid-19 have mostly shown protective effects, with a wide range of effect estimates,2627 but some failed to show an overall protective effect.2829 The methodology and data included in the earlier studies were heterogeneous and had limitations. Study populations have rarely been population based and often have included a small number of participants.3031 Analyses of different effects for different numbers of vaccine doses before covid-19 have not always been performed.2732 Because vaccination during follow-up has often not been a criterion for censoring, both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have been included in the unvaccinated group. In the present study, we used population based survival data of 589 722 individuals, censoring at both vaccination and reinfection, and report vaccine effectiveness separately for any dose, one dose, two doses, and three or more doses. Earlier studies have generally lacked a clear definition of PCC, and symptoms have often been self-reported,29303133 whereas we used register based clinical diagnoses of PCC as the outcome. Furthermore, in earlier studies follow-up duration has often been short,29 whereas in our study the median follow-up was 129 days from 28 days after a first registered infection. A recent systematic review concluded that being vaccinated against covid-19 before infection had a protective effect on PCC in 10 of the 12 included studies, with effect estimates ranging from 0.48 to 0.87 for any vaccine dose given before infection.11 Owing to high heterogeneity between studies and the low certainty of evidence, no meta-analysis was performed. In other systematic reviews, meta-analyses have, however, included several of these studies, but the results should be interpreted with caution.3435 One of these meta-analyses concluded that receiving two doses of vaccine before covid-19 was associated with a lower risk of PCC compared with no vaccination, with an odds ratio of 0.64,34 and that the odds ratio was 0.71 with at least one dose before infection.35 Using register data from the whole adult population in the two largest regions of Sweden, we showed that vaccination against covid-19 before infection was associated with a decreased risk of receiving a diagnosis of PCC. When stratifying by the median time between last vaccination and infection (126 days) to assess the potential different effects of recent versus earlier vaccination, we found that receiving the last vaccine dose more than 126 days before covid-19 was still associated with a relatively high vaccine effectiveness against PCC, and only slightly lower than in the main analysis. In addition, to ensure sufficient time between vaccination and the acute infection, in a sensitivity analysis we restricted the vaccinated population to those who received their last vaccine dose more than 14 days before covid-19, and the estimated vaccine effect did not markedly change from the main analysis. Furthermore, in the main analyses we only considered the first PCC diagnosis at least 28 days from infection, but in sensitivity analyses we required at least 90 days from infection, with similar results. Studies have shown that women may develop greater immune responses to vaccination than men,36 although this does not necessarily translate to better protection against the disease. In our study, men showed a higher vaccine effectiveness against PCC than women. It has not yet been fully established whether PCC is more likely to occur with particular variants. Available data suggest, however, that individuals infected with the omicron variant are at lower risk of developing long term effects of covid-19 than individuals infected with the other variants.373839 Nonetheless, it is difficult to determine if this lower risk is associated with the specific variant or is the result of immunity from previous infections or vaccinations, or as a result of shorter follow-up durations. A small study evaluating the protective effect of covid-19 vaccines against PCC, which included individuals with infections during the omicron period as well as the earlier periods, did not show significantly different results between the variants.30 In the present study, the study population included individuals with infections at the time when the alpha and delta variants predominated, and also during part of the pre-alpha and omicron periods. Although vaccination coverage was not evenly distributed during these periods, stratifying on the period of dominant variant at the time of infection showed only a slightly lower vaccine effectiveness against PCC in the omicron period than in the pre-alpha and alpha periods. As we did not have access to virus sequencing data in our analysis, we used the time of infection as a proxy for variant. Consequently, the variant causing acute infection in some of the study individuals might have been misclassified. The pathogenesis of PCC has not yet been clarified, but several mechanisms have been proposed relating to the different symptom manifestations and it has become increasingly evident that patients with PCC are a heterogenous group. Potential mechanisms include organ damage, abnormal immune activation during acute infection, reactivation of other viruses, altered systemic immunity, autoimmunity, and sustained immune activation due to viral persistence.40 Determining the pathogenesis might suggest potential pathways for the protective effect of the vaccines\u2014for example, a reduced viral load during the acute infection after vaccination could reduce the virus\u2019s persistence with lasting immune activation. Different symptom clusters of PCC may have different pathogeneses and therefore different mechanisms for the vaccine effect. We have shown that almost 37% of patients with covid-19 treated in the ICU subsequently have a PCC diagnosis.16 Covid-19 vaccines have been shown to protect against hospital admission with covid-19,41 which could be one pathway for the vaccines to exert a protective effect against PCC. In our analysis, vaccine effectiveness against PCC seemed to be only partly explained by a decreased risk of hospital admission. In addition, analyses stratified on severity of acute disease as indicated by the need for hospital admission showed that vaccine effectiveness was similar in both the group admitted to hospital without ICU admission and the group with no hospital admission. Furthermore, a study showed that those who were vaccinated after covid-19 had a lower risk of developing PCC compared with those who were unvaccinated 12 weeks after covid-19.26 This, together with the findings in the present study, support the hypothesis of pathways beyond the protective effect against hospital admission that may contribute to the protective effect of covid-19 vaccines against PCC. It is also important to note that symptoms of PCC are frequently observed not only in patients with confirmed covid-19 but also in those without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result.42",

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2021\/08\/30\/future-long-term-side-effects-from-covid-vaccines-are-extremely-unlikely\/",
        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited",

        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited",

        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited",

        "text":"Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on. First, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death. Let\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor. By way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived. Even so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID. To give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it. On the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza\/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID! *Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza\/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions. By way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19. It is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles. So now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition. Do you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about. Having said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities. As others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.",

        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited",

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2020\/09\/02\/covid-comorbidities-are-not-analogous-to-car-crashes-debunking-the-6-mortality-claim\/",
        "text":"Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on. First, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death. Let\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor. By way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived. Even so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID. To give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it. On the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza\/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID! *Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza\/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions. By way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19. It is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles. So now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition. Do you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about. Having said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities. As others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.",

        "text":"The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place. This article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence. Many of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories: 1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk\/mortality rates 9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines 14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness 21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science 24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc. With that out of the way, let\u2019s do this. Bad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous Reality: Yes it is; millions are dead Over 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Bad argument #2: 99.9% survive Reality: That still means millions of deaths The survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way. More details here Bad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low\/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities. Reality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID Comorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions). More details here. Bad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu Reality: Yes it is In the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu. Bad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine Reality: You can still become seriously ill and\/or spread it to others Being young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #). Also see #25 Bad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines Reality: Your immune system is only as good as its training Even a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d Details here Bad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines Reality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died. Homo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines. More details here Bad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t Reality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous Early evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations. Bad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA Reality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering. DNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you. More details here Bad argument #10: The vaccines are too new\/rushed Reality: No, they aren\u2019t\/weren\u2019t More details here and here Bad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects Reality: Yes, we do No vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will. More details here and here Bad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine Reality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing Again, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies. Bad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated Reality: They are safer with vaccines Hospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022). In contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022). Bad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective Reality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful This one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16). More details here and here. Bad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases) Reality: They reduce risk and severity Again, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)! This argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident. If you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs. Update 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine. Bad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID Reality: They reduce risk of transmission Vaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you. Bad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated Reality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers This claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15). More details here and here Bad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron Reality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness Omicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021). See #20 on boosters Bad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated? Reality: Because I care about others Vaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc. Bad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three Reality: So what? Why is that a problem? Bad argument #21: But science has been wrong before Reality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works Science is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines. Details here and here. Also, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus Reality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right Galileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21). Details here and here and here. Bad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe Reality: No there wasn\u2019t This is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22). See posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies\/It\u2019s all about money Reality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d I don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other See posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument. Bad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes] Reality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science The fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation. Additionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet. More details here and here and here. Bad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS Reality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem VAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25). More details here Bad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines Reality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks Adverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021). See studies cited in #10, 13\u201316 Bad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories\/FDA corruption Reality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories Conspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health\/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd. Bad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice\/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates Reality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health This is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers). Bad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026 Reality: Those are not good sources Please just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.

The time between wave crests can vary from 5 minutes to an hour. The hazard may persist for many hours or longer after the initial wave. Impacts can vary significantly from one section of coast to the next due to local bathymetry and the shape and elevation of the shoreline. Impacts can also vary depending upon the state of the tide at the time of the maximum tsunami waves. Persons caught in the water of a tsunami may drown, be crushed by debris in the water, or be swept out to sea. In an update posted at 15:35 UTC, NWS PTWC said tsunami waves reaching 1 to 3 m (3.3 \u2013 10 feet) above the tide level are possible along some coasts of the Philippines. Tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1 m (1 \u2013 3.3 feet) are possible for some coats of Palau. Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 m (1 feet) above the tide level for the coasts of American Samoa, China, Chuuk, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Howland and Baker, Indonesia, Japan, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kiribati, Kosrae, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Midway Island, Nauru, Northern Marianas, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Palmyra Island, Papua New Guinea, Pohnpei, Republic of Korea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Wake Island, Wallis and Futuna, and Yap. In an update posted at 16:45 UTC, PTWC said the tsunami threat from this earthquake has now passed. \u201cThere is no longer a tsunami threat from this earthquake.\u201d However, residents in the affected region are recommended to remain observant and exercise normal caution near the sea. The USGS issued a Green alert for shaking-related fatalities. There is a low likelihood of casualties. A Yellow alert was issued for economic losses. Some damage is possible and the impact should be relatively localized. Estimated economic losses are less than 1% of GDP of Philippines. Past events with this alert level have required a local or regional level response. Overall, the population in this region resides in structures that are a mix of vulnerable and earthquake-resistant construction. The predominant vulnerable building types are unknown\/miscellaneous types and heavy wood frame construction. Recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides that might have contributed to losses. Liquefaction triggered by this earthquake is estimated to be extensive in severity and (or) spatial extent, according to the USGS. The number of people living near areas that could have produced liquefaction in this earthquake is extensive (\u2265 1 000 000). This is not a direct estimate of liquefaction fatalities or losses. Little or no landsliding is expected, but some landslides could have occurred in highly susceptible areas. PHIVOLCS said the quake was associated with the subduction along the Philippine Trench. Image credit: TW\/SAM, Google Waves of 40 cm (1.3 feet) were observed on Japan\u2019s Hachijojima island, some 290 km (180 miles) south of Tokyo, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Raymark Gentallan, the police chief in Hinatuan (population 44 000), a coastal town situated approximately 30 km (19 miles) from the epicenter of the earthquake, reported a power outage in the area since the quake struck. Significant damage was reported in places, but the full extent of the damage is still being assessed. Reports on Sunday, December 3, mention at least one fatality \u2014 a woman who was killed when a wall collapsed as she and her family were fleeing their home in search of safety in Tagum City. At least 4 people were injured and 9 are missing. According to Defence Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, 529 families were affected. Aftershocks At least 71 aftershocks with magnitudes above 4.5 were registered until 06:18 UTC on December 3. The strongest ones included an M5.8 at 15:06 UTC, M6.4 at 16:03, M6.2 at 17:40, M6.2 at 18:09, and M6.0 at 20:52. PHIVOLCS registered hundreds of smaller earthquakes. M6.6 aftershock was recorded by the USGS at 10:35 UTC on December 3. This one was followed by numerous M4.5 -5.6 until M6.9 hit at 19:49 UTC. By 21:00 UTC on December 3, the USGS registered a total of 80 aftershocks with magnitudes above 4.5. Moderate to strong aftershocks could persist for several days to months, PHIVOLCS said.

        "text":"On September 19, 2023, the northeastern coastal province of Jiangsu in China was struck by a significant severe weather outbreak, with multiple tornadoes causing damage to more than 1 600 homes and tragically claiming the lives of at least 10 residents. Several destructive tornadoes, part of a larger severe weather outbreak, tore through NE China yesterday, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. Jiangsu Province experienced the most severe impact of the storm, with official reports confirming that over 1 600 homes were damaged or destroyed. The tragedy also claimed the lives of 10 individuals. A particularly strong EF3 tornado made landfall in Funing County. The Jiangsu weather bureau confirmed that this is the strongest tornado recorded in the area since the 2016 Funing EF4. The aftermath was grievous: complete annihilation of homes, vast expanses of farmland wiped clean, and trees stripped of their bark. One of the hardest hit areas was Banhu village which was hit by a powerful EF4 tornado 7 years ago. Two EF2 tornadoes touched down in Suqian, resulting in deaths of five individuals. Elsewhere, in Huaian, residents were left reeling from a series of unfortunate events: vehicles thrown askew, vast forests laid to waste, and homes reduced to rubble. While the final classification of the tornado that caused this damage is yet to be confirmed, Eric Wang, a Chinese extreme weather enthusiast, postulates that it may range between EF2 and EF3 based on his observation of the destruction. A broader understanding of the tornadoes\u2019 complete impact, both in terms of human loss and infrastructural damage, will become clearer in the coming days.

However, certain provinces, including Jiangsu, have experienced tornadoes more frequently than other regions in China. In recent years, there have been notable tornado events in Jiangsu. For example, in June 2016, a deadly tornado and hailstorm hit parts of Jiangsu Province, particularly in Yancheng city, resulting in significant fatalities and damage. This event was one of the deadliest tornadoes in China\u2019s recent history. Featured image credit: Eric Wang (stillshot)",

        "text":"On November 5, 2023, observers across the globe were treated to a striking light show, courtesy of a G3 \u2013 Strong geomagnetic storm. This solar event was powerful enough to push the typically high-latitude auroras into lower latitudes, with sightings as far south as Texas and Arizona in the United States, as well as in European countries like Italy and Greece. Sightings were also reported in Australia and New Zealand. Initial reports suggested these lights were auroras, but a closer examination revealed a different story. The red glows captured in images were identified as \u201cSAR arcs,\u201d a term dating back to their discovery in 1956. Dr. Tony Philipps of SpaceWeather.com highlighted this misnomer, emphasizing that SAR arcs are neither stable nor true auroras. Unlike auroras, which are created by charged particles from space interacting with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, SAR arcs originate from a different process. They signal the presence of heat energy escaping into the upper atmosphere from the Earth\u2019s ring current system. This system, shaped like a doughnut, encircles our planet, carrying a current measured in millions of amperes. The recent geomagnetic storm energized the ring current, leading to the widespread appearance of SAR arcs. Jeff Baumgardner from the Center for Space Physics at Boston University noted that the event was truly global, with their equipment detecting SAR arc activity stretching from Italy to New Zealand. Image credit: Texas (Anita Oakley); Missouri (Dan Bush); New York (James Perez-Rogers); Arizona (Jeremy Perez) via SpaceWeather.com SAR arcs have an unexpected link to another phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), which, like SAR arcs, is not an aurora. In a notable observation from 2015, a red SAR arc in New Zealand was seen transforming into STEVE, suggesting a metamorphosis similar to a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. This transformation was seemingly echoed on November 5 over Northumberland, UK, when Mark Savage observed STEVE emerge from a SAR arc in a matter of minutes, a timeline consistent with another observed transition in Canada in April 2022. While the connection between SAR arcs and STEVE is evident, the exact nature of their relationship remains elusive. Carlos Martinis, a leading researcher at Boston University, conveys that sometimes SAR arcs develop into STEVE, but not invariably. This active area of research benefits from the participation of both citizen scientists and professional researchers, contributing to a growing understanding of these fascinating atmospheric phenomena. Image credit: Mark Savage, SpaceWeather. Annotation: SpaceWeather The G3 \u2013 Strong geomagnetic storm that occurred on Sunday, November 5, 2023, was the result of a one-two punch from two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that had left the Sun on November 2 and 3. The initial CME set the stage, but it was the compounded effect of the two that led to the geomagnetic storm classified as G3, indicating strong effects that can have impacts on satellite operations, power grids, and navigation systems on Earth. The early indications of the storm\u2019s potential were evident when solar wind enhancement was first detected at 08:10 UTC on November 5, with instruments measuring a substantial rise in the solar wind\u2019s total field strength to 34 nT. The significant southward deflection of the magnetic field, or the Bz component, dipped to -27 nT, signaling a strong interaction was underway. Though this initial phase did not exhibit extremely high velocities, peaking at 434 km\/s, the conditions were set for a more intense second shock. This subsequent jolt, arriving at 11:46 UTC, brought a notable increase in total field strength to 45 nT. Over the following hours, the Bz component remained strongly negative, fluctuating between -15 and -20 nT, indicative of a robust geomagnetic disturbance. The solar wind speed surged to 517 km\/s, then settled into a faster-than-average stream of 460 \u2013 480 km\/s, sustaining the storm conditions and facilitating the remarkable global display of SAR arcs and the potential observation of the SAR to STEVE transformation.

Additionally, the number of people affected by diabetes continues to rise. People who have diabetes are more prone to infections, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diabetes has a significant impact on outcomes when it comes to COVID-19. This population is found to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and worse outcomes. By understanding the pathophysiology and pathways linking diabetes to severe COVID-19, pharmacists can identify new interventions or ways to optimize therapies.Diabetes plagues a large portion of the population, not only in the United States but also worldwide.Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and affects 11.3% of the population.Additionally, the number of people affected by diabetes continues to rise.People who have diabetes are more prone to infections, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).This population is found to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and worse outcomes. Therefore, understanding how to manage COVID-19 and its complications and promoting preventive care are crucial to optimizing medical therapy for these patients.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA virus, causes COVID-19, which spread exponentially throughout the world after its initial reports in Wuhan, China.As of August 2023, there were 769,369,823 confirmed cases worldwide and 6,954,336 deaths cumulatively reported to the World Health Organization.In comparison with the beginning of the pandemic, there is now a better understanding of the virus and disease process itself that has led to the identification of several therapies and strategies to treat and prevent COVID-19. Additionally, insight into which populations may be more affected as well as other risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes has emerged. Studies have demonstrated that those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, intensive care management and mechanical ventilation, and are more likely to die.A report from the CDC revealed that hospitalizations and deaths in patients with underlying conditions were six times and 12 times higher, respectively.Of those diagnosed with COVID-19, 9.8% to 18% had diabetes.Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes who acquire COVID-19 are more likely to have severe disease or poor outcomes.The risk is even higher with increased age and concomitant underlying medical conditions.Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects 37.3 million people in the U.S.19 Currently, 28.7 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes; however, 8.5 million people who have diabetes are undiagnosed and do not know they have it. It is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide.Its complications extend beyond insulin impairment, impaired insulin utilization, or glucose dysregulation. Although some concomitant diseases increase mortality with COVID-19, there are other proposed mechanisms at play that can contribute to worse outcomes in diabetics specifically.Diabetes is a risk factor for worse outcomes with infections such as influenza, pneumonia, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.Hyperglycemia increases the virulence of certain pathogens.Diabetics already carry a chronic low level of inflammation and experience changes in their innate immunity.For example, phagocytosis and chemotaxis are impaired in diabetes.Proinflammatory macrophages are also increased, natural-killer cells are decreased, and the T-cell activity is altered.It has also been suggested that COVID-19 induces an excessive stress response that results in increased production of catecholamines and glucocorticoids, leading to hyperglycemia.Increased blood glucose then leads to increased oxidative stress and production of proinflammatory cytokines but reduced lymphocyte-proliferative responses and functionality of neutrophils and macrophages.This increased level of inflammation during COVID-19 can be seen with elevated ferritin levels, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, d-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6.This increase could not only damage lung tissue and other tissues but can also potentiate coagulation pathways, causing microemboli in the lungs and large arterial vessels.The damage to other tissues could involve organs important to glucose metabolism.Multiorgan-level endothelial dysfunction can cause microvascular complications in patients with diabetes that further contribute to inflammation, vasoconstriction, and vascular lesions, which may result in tissue edema, organ ischemia, and a procoagulant state.To complicate matters, injury to lung tissue can also increase the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to bind to host cells.Diabetics also seem to have significantly thicker endothelial capillary basal lamina and alveolar epithelia, so they may experience impaired respiratory function.In addition to the mechanisms by which diabetes alters the immune system and contributes to poor outcomes with COVID-19, there are other risk factors that can contribute to worse outcomes in diabetics with COVID-19. Hyperglycemia with or without diabetes was linked with increased mortality and worse glycemic control with more severe COVID-19.Studies suggest that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts men, the elderly, minority populations, and people with comorbidities other than diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), microvascular and macrovascular complications, and obesity.Among those, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were more common in diabetics who were hospitalized with COVID-19.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was also found to be an independent risk factor for death.Having obesity can also further increase the risk for severe COVID-19 because obesity can alter lung function, produce inflammatory cytokines due to visceral fat, and increase thromboembolic events.Longer length of stay and increased hospitalizations have been associated with lower socioeconomic status, older patients, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, poor glycemic control, insulin use, longer duration of diabetes, or presence of other complications.One study demonstrated that lower discharge rates were associated with hypertension, microvascular or macrovascular diabetic complications, heart failure, and COPD, as well as patients who had markers of inflammation such as CRP, high white cell count, lower lymphocyte count, and higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or dyspnea or higher plasma creatinine on admission.Death was more likely in those who were male, had a longer duration of diabetes, a history of microvascular and macrovascular complications, heart failure, and COPD, or those with COVID-19 symptoms, fever, dyspnea, and biological findings, such as higher plasma glucose, creatinine, AST, white cells, lymphocytes, platelets, CRP, and creatinine phosphokinase on admission. The lack of COVID-19 vaccination seemed to also be linked with increased fatality. Current management of adult COVID-19 patients includes using therapies that decrease viral replication, disease progression, and the inflammatory immune response.8 Strategies for pediatric patients are extrapolated mostly from the adult population.32 The current management of hospitalized adult patients per the National Institutes of Health is summarized in TABLE 1. Other supportive care measures to consider include treating bacterial pneumonia if the clinical suspicion is high and providing antipyretics, oxygen therapy as needed, and thromboprophylaxis.8 Managing diabetic patients with COVID-19 extends beyond treatment of the infection alone. Managing hyperglycemia is critical, as insulin resistance seems to be enhanced by COVID-19.26 Hyperglycemia has been associated with increased morbidity, length of stay, ICU needs, and mortality in the inpatient setting.23 Persistently elevated fasting blood glucose seems to promote viral replication, decrease clearance of SARS-CoV-2, and slow recovery.5,26 Therefore, intensive glucose monitoring at least four times daily is important in the management of a diabetic patient with COVID-19.6 Hemoglobin A1C should also be checked.20 Those with preprandial blood glucose persistently above 180 mg\/dL should be given antihyperglycemic therapy with a targeted blood glucose of 140 mg\/dL to 180 mg\/dL.5 This is especially important since some patients may require glucocorticoid therapy in their treatment course for COVID-19, which can cause hyperglycemia. Risk factors for steroid-induced hyperglycemia in those without diabetes include high-dose steroids, long-term steroid use, older age, history of gestational diabetes or impaired fasting blood glucose, family history of diabetes, abdominal obesity, and ethnicity associated with high risk for diabetes.8 Subcutaneous insulin regimens are typically preferred in managing hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients although insulin infusions may be used in the critically ill with appropriate monitoring.6,8,23 Insulin is easily titratable based on renal function and nutritional status.8 Oral antihyperglycemic agents are generally not recommended for in-hospital use, although there has been some evidence demonstrating their effects when used to manage hyperglycemia in diabetics with COVID-19.23 Metformin seems to be linked with reduction in mortality, hospitalization, and need for ICU care; however, metformin use in-hospital is limited by potentially life-threatening adverse effects such as lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury and should be avoided in the critically ill, severe respiratory distress, renal impairment, or heart failure.5,16,20,23 When it comes to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, the evidence did not demonstrate benefit or harm from their use in diabetics with COVID-19.5 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists could potentially provide improved outcomes and decreased mortality, hospitalizations, and respiratory complications, but their use is often limited due to the time needed to titrate the medication before their benefits are realized and associated side effects such as dehydration, nausea, vomiting, and aspiration pneumonia.5,6 Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are generally avoided for hospital use due to the hypoglycemia and volume depletion that could cause diabetic ketoacidosis.5 Sulfonylureas are not typically recommended due to the risk of hypoglycemia.5,6 Thiazolidinediones are generally not recommended due to the risk of fluid retention or weight gain that could aggravate heart failure.5,6 Hyperglycemic emergencies such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are also of concern in COVID-19 patients, as they tend to have higher mortality compared with patients without COVID-19.23 Although the data on DKA in COVID-19 are limited, the mortality rates have been reported as high as 40% to 50%.8 The standard management consisting of continuous insulin and isotonic fluids and electrolyte repletion is used to replete intravascular volume, improve renal perfusion, and decrease hyperglycemia, counterregulatory hormones, hepatic gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis.8,20 There are some protocols now where SC insulin is used in mild and moderate DKA in patients without major comorbidities and who are not pregnant. Diabetics are also at increased risk for acute kidney injury.8 Diabetic foot ulcers can worsen due to the inflammation and prothrombotic state from COVID-19. Diabetics with COVID-19 seem to experience long-term symptoms compared with their nondiabetic comparators.33 These symptoms include fatigue, neurocognitive dysfunction, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The elderly and obese tend to have worse outcomes and persistent symptoms. Preventive methods are a vital part to managing COVID-19 and protecting the community.8 Preventive measures include wearing well-fitted masks in areas of high community transmission, social distancing (especially in crowded and poorly ventilated areas), and practicing general hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing. Vaccinations are encouraged.8,34 Although it has been shown that immunity wanes in the months following vaccination, the likelihood of experiencing severe disease after vaccination is less compared with those who are unvaccinated. In those who developed severe disease, at least one of the following risk factors was present: aged 65 years and older; immunocompromised state; chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, or liver disease; or diabetes. Because of the waning immunity, booster vaccinations are recommended.8 Despite the recommendations for vaccines, vaccine hesitancy and barriers to vaccination remain. The speed of vaccine production has raised skepticism around its efficacy. An infodemic\u2014where too much information, including that which is false or misleading\u2014can create confusion and generate mistrust in the healthcare system and towards healthcare authorities. Limited healthcare literacy can also contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Fear of deportation due to immigration status, previous experience with exploitative treatment and experimentation on certain communities, and racial discrimination further the mistrust of the medical community. Inadequate access to resources and healthcare information also contributes to the lack of information or prohibits much-needed groups from being informed. Other possible contributors to vaccine hesitancy include religious reasons, perception that COVID-19 is not a dangerous or serious disease, use of traditional remedies, fear of injection, and other cultural reasons. Conclusion REFERENCES Diabetes has a significant impact on outcomes when it comes to COVID-19. By understanding the pathophysiology and pathways linking diabetes to severe COVID-19, pharmacists can identify new interventions or ways to optimize therapies. Awareness of the differences in COVID-19 outcomes in diabetics can serve as additional motivation to not only improve understanding of risk factors but also advocate for diabetics to optimize outcomes, encourage appropriate therapies, and support vaccinations to prevent infection. 1.

        "text":"Excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries when using standard methods because of gaps in the underlying data. Therefore, statistical methods are required to derive the expected and total deaths based on the levels of data available for countries; this is why these figures are called 'estimates'. The methodology for generating the estimates adopts a statistical method called a Poisson regression model and has been developed in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and an appointed Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Mortality Assessment. Our estimates have a range of uncertainty per country and that level of uncertainty is directly related to a country's reporting capacity and variable data quality. As we chart the range between the upper and lower bounds of uncertainty for WHO regions, we are able to observe the relative availability of data for each region and how data gaps disproportionately impact some parts of the world more than others. If the uncertainty bounds are larger, this indicates that there is less available data and therefore, a corresponding greater degree of uncertainty. These ranges in uncertainty serve to highlight the ongoing need and work of WHO, as we partner with countries to strengthen national Health Information Systems, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems and reporting of causes of death, and integrated surveillance systems to help improve data availability and close 'data gaps'.",

        "text":"Overview COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It usually spreads between people in close contact. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die, but most people will recover without treatment. People over age 60 and those with existing medical conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill. These conditions include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression including HIV, cancer and pregnancy. Unvaccinated people also have a higher risk of severe symptoms. Symptoms People may experience different symptoms from COVID-19. Symptoms usually begin 5\u20136 days after exposure and last 1\u201314 days. The most common symptoms are: fever chills sore throat. Less common symptoms are: muscle aches and heavy arms or legs severe fatigue or tiredness runny or blocked nose, or sneezing headache sore eyes dizziness new and persistent cough tight chest or chest pain shortness of breath hoarse voice numbness or tingling appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea loss or change of sense of taste or smell difficulty sleeping. People with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical attention: difficulty breathing, especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences confusion drowsiness or loss of consciousness persistent pain or pressure in the chest skin being cold or clammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour loss of speech or movement. People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include people taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer. obesity or dementia. People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms. These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition). The most common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity). Long COVID can affect a person\u2019s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores. Treatment Most people will recover without needing treatment in a hospital. For those who need it, doctors will suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse. They will consider the person\u2019s age and if they have other health problems. More on treatment Prevention People should get vaccinated as soon as it\u2019s their turn. They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: avoid crowds and keep a safe distance from others, even if they don\u2019t appear to be sick; wear a properly fitted mask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you are at high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas; clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze; dispose of used tissues right away and clean your hands; and if you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover. Vaccination against COVID-19 is based on priority groups such as people aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic health problems, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant persons, and unvaccinated people. In March 2023, WHO updated its recommendations on primary series vaccination (two doses of any vaccine) as well as the need for booster doses. These recommendations are time-limited and can change at any time depending on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is circulating in your area or country. It is important to stay up to date with local guidelines and recommendations provided by your local health authority. Since its introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives across the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even though vaccines protect against severe disease and death, it is still possible to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others after being vaccinated. WHO response The World Health Organization is the global coordinating agency for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Organization works with Member States and partners on all aspects of the pandemic response, including facilitating research, developing guidance, coordinating vaccine development and distribution, and monitoring daily case numbers and trends around the world. Since April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight a disease. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator is a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO also leads work to improve global capacity and access to oxygen production, distribution and supply to patients. Although WHO announced the end of the emergency phase of COVID-19 in May 2023, the Organization continues to coordinate the global response.",

        "text":"COVAX will close 31 December 2023 having delivered nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to 146 economies, and averted an estimated 2.7 million deaths in AMC lower-income participating economies. averted an estimated 2.7 million deaths in AMC lower-income participating economies. COVAX\u2019s end-to-end efforts helped lower-income economies achieve two-dose coverage of 57%, compared to the global average of 67%. Low- and lower middle-income economies will continue to receive COVID-19 vaccines and delivery support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in 2024 and 2025, with 83 million doses so far requested for 2024 from 58 economies. COVAX, the multilateral mechanism for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines launched in 2020, will draw to a close on 31 December. Jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), COVAX has so far supplied nearly 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses and safe injection devices to 146 economies. Its efforts are estimated to have helped avert the deaths of at least 2.7 million people in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) low- and lower middle-income participating economies (lower-income economies) that received free doses through the mechanism, alongside nearly US$ 2 billion in critical support to turn vaccines into vaccinations. These 92 lower-income economies that were eligible to participate in the programme with support from the financing mechanism known as the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (COVAX AMC) will continue to have the option to receive COVID-19 vaccine doses and delivery support through Gavi\u2019s regular programmes. So far, 58 lower-income economies have requested a total of 83 million doses in 2024, with plans to focus on the continued protection of priority groups, including health care workers, community workers and older adults. Unprecedented emergency response Drawing on the lessons of the H1N1 pandemic, when the majority of countries missed out on vaccines, COVAX partners advocated from the earliest stages of the COVID-19 emergency that \u201cno one is safe until everyone is safe\u201d \u2013 urging the world to place vaccine equity at the heart of the global response, and calling for every country to have at least enough doses to protect those most at risk. By the end of 2020, 190 economies of all income levels had signed agreements to participate in COVAX, making it one of the most significant multilateral partnerships of the 21st century. By November 2020, it had raised US$ 2 billion towards vaccine procurement; and in January 2021, 39 days after the first vaccine administration in a high-income country, the first COVAX-supplied doses were administered in a lower-income country. COVAX was designed as an end-to-end coordination mechanism encompassing R&D and manufacturing, policy guidance, vaccine portfolio development, regulatory systems, supply allocation and country readiness assessments, transport logistics, vaccine storage and administration, and monitoring country coverage and absorption rates. However, as an emergency solution launched in the midst of the pandemic, COVAX faced many challenges. Without having any cash reserves up front, it was initially limited in its ability to sign early contracts with manufacturers, and while it was able to ship doses to 100 economies in the first six weeks of global roll-out, export bans and other factors meant that large-volume deliveries were only received in the third quarter of 2021. While COVAX was unable to completely overcome the tragic vaccine inequity that characterized the global response, it made a significant contribution to alleviating the suffering caused by COVID-19 in the Global South. Today, the initiative has supplied 74% of all COVID-19 vaccine doses supplied to low-income countries (LICs) during the pandemic; and in total, 52 of the 92 AMC-eligible economies relied on COVAX for more than half of their COVID-19 vaccine supply. Thanks to the tireless efforts of national governments, health and frontline workers, civil society organisations and others, those doses, delivered free of charge and combined with nearly US$2 billion in delivery support, helped to lift primary series coverage among the 92 AMC-eligible economies to 57%, compared to a global average of 67%. Two-dose coverage of health care workers, those most critical to saving lives and keeping health systems running, stands at 84% in lower-income economies. COVAX also deployed 2.5 million doses to protect the most vulnerable in humanitarian and conflict settings through a first-of-its kind mechanism called the Humanitarian Buffer, co-designed with international humanitarian organisations, and set up as a last resort to reach those who are not easily reached through government programmes. Attempting to deliver novel products through non-governmental channels proved to be incredibly difficult, but the effort provided deep insight into the systemic barriers that are exacerbated by a global emergency situation. Governments, humanitarian institutions, global health organisations and others are now working to apply these lessons towards ongoing programmes, and advocating for how we can better protect the most vulnerable populations in a future pandemic. Investing in lessons learnt for a future response COVAX\u2019s successes and challenges in the bid to overcome inequity have underscored the clear need for the world to be better prepared the next time a viral threat with pandemic potential emerges. The plethora of learnings from COVAX\u2019s unique effort must be considered in the development of future global pandemic preparedness and response architecture. These include strengthening existing capacity by designing, investing in and implementing an end-to-end solution to equitable access ahead of time, one that centres on the needs of the most vulnerable; recognising that vaccine nationalism will persist in future pandemics and putting in place mechanisms to mitigate it \u2013 including by diversifying vaccine manufacturing so all regions have access to supply; and accepting the need to take financial risks to avoid potentially deadly delays to the development, procurement and delivery of medical countermeasures. With collaboration from manufacturers, all of COVAX\u2019s advance purchase supply agreements will have been completed or terminated by the end of 2023, with the exception of one, where a modest volume of supply will continue into the first half of 2024 in support of the new COVID-19 routine immunization programme. Thanks in large part due to the savings gained through the successful renegotiation of supply contracts, some COVAX AMC funds remain in the contingency mechanism known as the Pandemic Vaccine Pool, and these can now be reinvested into translating the lessons from COVAX Facility into concrete actions. This includes the establishing of an African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a result of our learnings from the pandemic where Africa was left vulnerable to supply restrictions. Investment in AVMA will make up to US$ 1 billion available to support vaccine manufacturing on the African continent. In addition, a First Response Fund will be established to ensure financing for a vaccine response is immediately available in the event of a future pandemic. It also includes funding \u201cThe Big Catch-up\u201d effort designed to fill the gaps in immunization resulting from the pandemic which are now causing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases around the world and threatening the achievement of Immunization Agenda 2030 goals. \u201cMillions of people are alive today who would not have been here without COVAX. Those averted deaths mean mothers can continue to nurture their children, and grandparents can enjoy watching future generations flourish,\u201d said Jane Halton, Chair of the Board of CEPI. \u201cDespite being built and funded from scratch amid the deadliest pandemic the world has seen in more than a century, COVAX\u2019s life-saving accomplishments were considerable. It should take its place in history and be proud of what it was able to accomplish but also serve as a reminder to us all that we can and must do better next time.\u201d \u201cCOVID-19 has been the greatest health challenge of our time, and it was met with innovation and partnership on an equally unprecedented scale,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \u201cCOVAX\u2019s impact has been historic, as are the insights it has generated on how, concretely, the world can do better next time. As we transition COVID-19 into Gavi\u2019s routine programming, we do so with deep gratitude for the passion, dedication and sacrifice of so many around the globe who fought tirelessly for three years to try and create a more equitable world \u2013 and with an unwavering commitment to improve by transforming learnings into tangible action.\u201d \u201cThe joint efforts of all partners to ensure an equitable response to the pandemic helped protect the futures of millions of children in vulnerable communities,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. \u201cThis huge and historic undertaking is something we can be collectively proud of and build on. UNICEF will continue to deliver vaccines to the world's youngest to stop the spread of all preventable diseases and build strong health systems for the future.\u201d \"We knew that market forces alone would not deliver equitable access to vaccines and other tools,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"The creation of ACT-A and COVAX gave millions of people around the world access to vaccines, tests, treatments and other tools who would otherwise have missed out. COVAX has taught us valuable lessons that will help us to be better prepared for future epidemics and pandemics.\" Notes to editors Key Learnings \u2013 For a detailed overview on COVAX key learnings and recommendations for future pandemic preparedness and response, read this white paper: https:\/\/www.gavi.org\/news-resources\/knowledge-products\/covax-key-learnings-future-pandemic-preparedness-and-response \u201c The Delivery\u201d \u2013 For access to a unique interactive deep dive into the stories and data that defined the COVID-19 delivery effort, available to all media organisations under Creative Commons license, please reach out to the media contacts below.

        "text":"originally posted by: chr0naut originally posted by: Gradcrop originally posted by: chr0naut a reply to: Gradcrop Will they also be investigating the COVID-19 deniers and super-spreaders who refused to take actions against the disease and encouraged others to do likewise? You seem to be a vaccine apologist who refuses to admit that these vaccines have caused a range of serious adverse reactions and deaths following vaccine mandates, lies and propaganda, by the mainstream media that pushed the government narratives. Nobody will be investigating those who refused to get 'vaccinated' and refused to peddle the government narratives and dogma. They are on the right side of history and haven't committed any crimes. I suppose that the court case will come down to a comparison between the numbers saved by the immunizations, and the numbers harmed by the immunizations. No, the court case will come down to violating law and how much money the pharmaceutical industry and their many proxies have poured into the media and government services of Italy.Just because a bunch of morons believe more lies about a gorillion people being saved from vaccines that don't prevent illness or transmission, from proven liars... like you... doesn't mean that laws were not violated.Why anybody would listen to you after you recently quintupled down on lying with the claim that Ivermectin, salt, and sugar are more harmful than COVID vaccines I can't guess. You should lead every post with that utter nonsense so people can decide how credible you are.But just in case anyone reading is new... this poster is spreading flase information in other threads and has been posting misleading and false information for years. They literally have never deviated from what the pharmaceutical influencers have propagated, as they were paid handsomely to do. They have offered not a single criticism of the video evidence of the Pfizer CEO lying to the public about transmission. They have not condemned the officials they sourced for their facts admitting to lying about transmission to justify the premise of segregating society and to continue denying medical treatment to unvaccinated individuals. They lied to better trick the population into taking a vaccine that they also refused to give you transparent informed consent for. This poster is on their side... but they say we're the dangerous ones.They don't care about truth. They care about a political narratives. There can be no real discussion because there can be no back and forth, no admission of error... only the narrative. They believe that you are all so dumb and ignorant that after telling lies for three years you will be shamed into not believing the facts they desperately tried to censor and lied to you about. All with the end goal of having you take a novel therapy that is known to contain DNA contamination in excess of establish limits, to have had no thorough QA\/QC, to contain oncological promoters, to have the ability to enter your blood stream, to produce toxic spike proteins in places that would never be exposed ti them during normal respiratory infection.Now they have been discovered making outright false claims with no plausible data that could ever be misconstrued to fit their lies, that they knew to be false and now refuse to address. This is three years of denial, three years of repeating the same lies as if building on them makes them true. They still haven't acknowledged that the majority of COVID deaths before vaccine deployment were people with multiple comorbidities that were over the average age of life expectancy. They still pretend the deaths were not heavily manipulated and constantly exaggerated... which even the NY Times shills have admitted. Healthy people under 60 were never at real risk and the world never had to shut down. The disease is endemic, was always going to be, and now those with uncompromised immune systems have been exposed. Every year their immunity will update via natural processes and those that continue to vaccinate will have increasingly diminished capacity to adapt immune response.This nonsense how deniers and super spreaders should be tried for murder is absurd hyperbole and is the same kind dumb lie they used early on to censor victims of vaccine injuries and jail innocent people engaging in basic human rights like being outside. These sick people want you in jail for spreading COVID that the US Government paid to engineer and say it's your fault grandma died, but if you get HIV after decades of unprotected sex with strangers and give it to a teen during a sexual assault they'll post your bail and call you a victim.This poster has consistently downplayed credible reports of adverse events, having only ever denied that any were happening. They adopted an authoritarian one-size-fits all opinion in line with their apparently crack-addled PM... supporting the destruction of small business, children's educational development, and basic human rights for pandemic control methods that were long disregarded in public health planning because they were known to be ineffective and counter-productive to long term population health.They continue to deny that COVID vaccines are proven without any credible refutation to have had more VAERS reports of adverse events than all other marketed vaccines combined, ever. The trial data was highly manipulated, their subsequent claims based on trial data have been thoroughly proven fraudulent, and the poster in question has failed to ever accept responsibility for promoting lies told by the people he claims are authorities.They will not address their open disregard for medical ethics or why they believe healthy children should be put at any additional risk of death or disability for an ineffective therapy, with known genetic contamination, that provides them no benefit because they are documented to have almost no risk of serious illness from COVID. Prior to vaccine deployment there were no healthy children that I can find that died from COVID... yet they lied about dead kids and pediatric ICUs to drive fear and this poster still lies about it today.This poster is okay with you and your kids taking risks of unknown frequency and magnitude several times a year for a disease you are still going to get, with drugs and techniques that have a history of safety failures that kept them from being approved under normal trial conditions, and you not being given full and transparent access to the data for them. They support and continue to defend the censorship of regular people who tell the truth, because their lies do not survive an educated refutation from people that actually know the field and follow the science.",

Yes, 100%I personally know of several hundred elderly in that category and probably around 60 or so with 3 vaccines. 100% got COVID. Yes 100% of those with 3 vaccines got COVID.I won't take anymore COVID vaccines, it is an exercise in futility and perhaps dangerous to my health. I won't take the new RSV \"vaccine\" for the elderly either, as it is RNA based and not a true vaccine at all, just like the COVID \"vaccine\". They do not use the actual virus but rather a genetic combination of who knows what to \"prevent\" the disease, except they don't prevent squat as far as I can tell.What we do know is that so far the COVID vaccine is dangerous to young men and caused heart issues, despite that the Biden administration fired thousands of military men for not getting the vaccine when our military is having a severe shortage of people.What I do know is that one friend got the super cancer some say is a result of the \"vaccine\" that went from zero to kill in 8 weeks after 2 COVID vaccines. What I do know is that many of my close friends with 2 or more vaccines who are elderly got radically sicker and weaker after their vaccines and the one died.Biden lied, Fauci lied and forced people at the threat of losing their livelihoods, weakened the military even, if people did not take a vaccine that prevented nothing as far as has been proven, and did great harm to many young men which has been proven, and may have caused other issues.What I also see is that these \"vaccines\" are being pushed on the elderly. The most expensive category of citizen for any nation, including the US. What a convenient way to drastically reduce the number of expensive elderly (social security\/medicare) than to create a genetic concoction to \"help\" them that actually harms them. There is more real proof of harm to people than there is to helping people. So what a great way for any government to reduce the number of elderly than by \"helping\" them to death and looking like they are trying to do good while actually doing great harm. Just my theory.",

From 1988 to 2006, there was a doubling of the prevalence of four types of chronic conditions (obesity, asthma, behavior\/learning problems and \u201cother\u201d physical conditions), which rose from 12.8% to 26.6% of American children and youth. A 2011 Academic Pediatrics study \u201cestimated 43% of U.S. children (32 million) currently have at least 1 of 20 chronic health conditions assessed, increasing to 54.1% when overweight, obesity or being at risk for developmental delays are included.\u201d Pediatric autoimmune conditions are also on the rise. Autism, ADHD, asthma and allergies have doubled since that time, with autism now one in 30 children in some regions in the U.S. \u201cIn 2020\u201321, the number of students ages 3\u201321 who received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was 7.2 million, or 15 percent of all public school students. Among students receiving special education services, the most common category of disability was specific learning disabilities (33 percent).\u201d Mounting evidence indicates environmental toxins such as heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides as the principal culprits, while studies link vaccines and toxic vaccine ingredients to a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including seizures, neurodevelopmental disorders and infant death. As the medical, public health, and government circles remain silent on the social and economic fallout from these toxic exposures, American children have never been so sick. 4 in 10 Teens suffering from depression Children experiencing depression often feel persistently sad, hopeless or irritable, and can feel worthless, useless or guilty.

        "text":"In the midst of a contentious debate about Chicago\u2019s plan to force employers to require their workers to take the COVID-19 vaccine, Karen Freeman-Wilson, president of the Chicago Urban League, appeared on television to dismiss complaints that such rules would disproportionately harm the Black community. \u201cThe health and safety factor here far outweighs the concern about shutting people out or creating a barrier,\u201d Freeman-Wilson said on WTTW in August 2021. Earlier that year, her group had received a $100,000 grant from Pfizer, the manufacturer of one of the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, for a project to promote \"vaccine safety and effectiveness.\u201d Although the Chicago Urban League is not normally shy about disclosing its corporate donors, the support from Pfizer is not listed in the \u201cpartners\u201d section on its website. The drug industry funding likewise went unmentioned during the interview. Pfizer\u2019s grant to the Chicago Urban League was one of many that Pfizer made to nonprofits and trade organizations. Pfizer doled out special funding to groups across the country that lobbied in favor of government policies to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine. The extensive list of those with funding from the pharmaceutical giant includes consumer, doctor, and medical groups, as well as public health organizations and civil rights nonprofits. Many of those groups did not disclose the funding they received from Pfizer while they were advocating for policies that would force workers to get the vaccine. There were several different and sometimes overlapping vaccine mandates in the country. At the federal level, President Joe Biden issued an executive order, which was ultimately struck down in court, mandating vaccinations at all employers with 100 workers or more. A number of state and local governments forced public employees to get vaccinated and tried to force private-sector employers to follow suit. And many large employers required their employees to get vaccinated without any prodding from the government. Critics of these employer mandates have noted that the majority of the proposed mandates, including Biden\u2019s, made no exception for individuals with natural immunity through prior infection. Proponents of the mandates claimed that the vaccines would prevent transmission of COVID-19, an argument that lacked sound scientific basis at the time and has further unraveled. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,\u201d Biden falsely claimed in July 2021, as his administration and local governments were preparing mandate orders. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, similarly stated that vaccinated individuals \"do not carry the virus.\" But it wasn\u2019t just these unsupported claims by leading government officials that shaped the groundwork for COVID-19 mandates. A coalition of highly visible groups backed by Pfizer and the pharmaceutical industry provided much of the lobbying support for coercive vaccine policies. Here are the most important examples: The National Consumers League, a century-old corporate watchdog group, announced support for \u201cgovernment and employer mandates requiring [COVID-19] vaccination\" in August 2021, during roughly the same period in which it accepted $75,000 from Pfizer earmarked for \u201cvaccine policy efforts.\u201d The organization is also led in part by Andrea LaRue, who serves as an NCL board member. LaRue\u2019s work as a highly paid contract lobbyist to Pfizer, focused on vaccine policy, is not disclosed by NCL\u2019s website. The Immunization Partnership , a Houston-based public health nonprofit, lobbied publicly against Texas legislation in 2021 designed to prevent vaccine passports and municipal vaccine mandates. The Immunization Partnership claimed that the bills \u201cerode the vital role of our state\u2019s public health and medical experts in combating this pandemic.\u201d The partnership did not disclose that it received $35,000 from Pfizer that year for \u201clegislative advocacy.\u201d The American Pharmacists Association, American College of Preventive Medicine, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, American Society for Clinical Pathology and the American College of Emergency Physicians signed a letter in support of the Biden administration mandate to require employers with 100 or more employees to require their employees to be fully vaccinated or tested at least weekly. The organizations all received individual grants from Pfizer. The National Hispanic Medical Association worked with public relations firm Culture One World to distribute \"press release and media placements\" that \"called on employers of essential workers to mandate COVID-19 vaccines.\" The group also signed on to joint statements lobbying in favor of the Biden administration vaccine mandate. NHMA received $30,000 from BIO, a vaccine industry lobby group that represents Pfizer and Moderna, IRS filings show. The American Academy of Pediatrics was one of the most visible organizations working to build public support for vaccine mandates. The organization received multiple, specialized grants from Pfizer in 2021. Pfizer also provided grants to individual state chapters of the AAP earmarked for lobbying on vaccine policy. The Ohio AAP chapter, for instance, lobbied the Ohio legislature against bills to curb coercive COVID-19 vaccine policies, while receiving an \u201cimmunization legislation\u201d advocacy grant from Pfizer. The pharmaceutical industry remained largely in the background on these controversial mandate policies, which faced opposition from a broad array of civil libertarians, labor unions, and community-based groups. Instead, the industry mobilized support for the mandates through third-party organizations to which it typically provided financial support. Pfizer and most of the organizations funded by the pharmaceutical giant listed above did not respond to a request for comment. The American College of Preventive Medicine noted in an email that the group endorsed the COVID-19 vaccine mandate after the policy was brought to the organization's board. \"Regarding the specific question about the COVID-19 vaccines, supporting a vaccine mandate does not support one vaccine manufacturer over another,\" said Drew Wallace, a spokesperson for ACPM. Critics note that drug industry money presents an inherent conflict of interest that shaped the discourse around COVID-19 mandates. \u201cIf people or institutions advocated for or implemented mandates, while failing to disclose ties to the vaccine companies, that is a serious ethical violation, and potentially even unlawful, and should be thoroughly investigated,\u201d said Jenin Younes, an attorney formerly with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, who brought some of the first legal challenges to vaccine mandates. Donate Subscriptions Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, an expert in bioethics, noted that pharmaceutical firms routinely finance outside organizations to shape medical decisions and health care policy. Pfizer, Kheriaty said, engaged in a \u201cform of market manipulation by pushing mandates using organizations that present themselves as scientifically credible, or acting in the public interest, while creating by force a market for the company\u2019s products.\u201d \u201cPharmaceutical companies spend very large portions of their budgets on marketing, including on various health care organizations and third parties, and they do that because they get a return on that investment. It makes business sense,\u201d Kheriaty noted. The pharmaceutical industry has long shaped health care policy through outside advocacy organizations. The late Evan Morris, a former lobbyist for Genentech, famously once presided over a $50 million lobbying budget, much of which went to third-party groups that amplified the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s messages. In one particularly lucrative coup, Morris used outside groups to stoke fears and plant news stories around avian-flu and the need for the government to stockpile Tamiflu. The public relations tactic reportedly helped generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Genentech parent company Roche, which manufactures Tamiflu. On another occasion, Morris orchestrated a delay in the Food and Drug Administration's decision to ban the use of the cancer drug Avastin, then one of Genentech's most profitable products. The FDA had determined that Avastin was ineffective in treating breast cancer, but Smith mobilized outside advocacy groups to pressure the agency to reconsider its decision, according to the Wall Street Journal. Efforts by other controversial drug makers to employ similar strategies have been well documented. For example, Purdue Pharma covertly funded third-party advocacy groups to encourage looser criteria for prescribing OxyContin and other highly addictive opioid painkillers. In the case of Pfizer, the company was able to mobilize widespread support among policymakers to make its COVID-19 vaccine one of the most profitable medical products in history. In 2021 alone, Pfizer generated over $36.7 billion in revenue from the vaccine. \"From a public health perspective, [the vaccine mandates] did not make any sense for a couple of reasons,\u201d said Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a professor of medicine on leave from Harvard University. \u201cOne is that if you had COVID, then you have excellent immunity,\u201d Kulldorff said. \u201cThe second is that back in 2021, when there was a shortage of vaccines, the important thing was to vaccinate older, high risk Americans and also in other parts of the world like India and Brazil, but instead a lot of the vaccines went to younger people who are low risk and didn't need it.\u201d The Biden administration later faced a string of rulings from federal courts declaring the mandate unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in January 2022 overturned the OSHA requirement that mandated workers at businesses with 100 or more employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations, but left in place mandates for workers in medical facilities. Workers affected by other COVID-19 vaccine mandates weren\u2019t so lucky. New York City terminated more than 1,700 members of its municipal workforce for their refusal to comply with a vaccine mandate that took effect in October 2021. This year, the city ended its vaccine mandate, but many of the fired workers are still fighting to get their jobs back in court. Kheriaty, the bioethicist, was fired from the University of California-Irvine School of Medicine for refusing to comply with the university's vaccine mandate, claiming natural immunity from prior infection. He is one of thousands of people fired because of similar policies. \u201cWe tossed overboard the principle of informed consent and assumed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the COVID vaccine would help people beyond the specific recipient,\u201d Kheriaty said.

The same US government, other governments and the WHO that imposed draconian measures on citizens to force us to be vaccinated; take dangerous, expensive, experimental drugs; withheld effective treatments; and refused to tell us that most people who required ICU care for COVID were vitamin D-deficient; and never said that taking vitamin D would lessen COVID\u2019s severity\u2013decided in 2021 we suddenly needed an international pandemic treaty. Why? To prevent and ameliorate future pandemics or biological warfare events\u2026 so we would not suffer again as we did with the COVID pandemic, they insisted. The WHO would manage it. What the WHO and our governments conveniently failed to mention is that we suffered so badly because of their medical mismanagement and our governments\u2019 merciless economic shutdowns and mismanagement. According to the World Bank, an additional 70 million people were forced into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. This was due to policies issued by our nations\u2019 rulers, their handpicked advisers and the World Health Organization, which issued guidance to shut down economic activity that most nations adopted without question. The WHO is acutely aware of the consequences children have had to pay for the economic lockdowns it imposed, having published the following: Malnutrition persisted in all its forms, with children paying a high price: in 2020, over 149 million children under-fives are estimated to have been stunted, or too short for their age; more than 45 million \u2013 wasted, or too thin for their height\u2026 Starvation may have killed more people than COVID, and they were disproportionately the youngest, rather than the oldest.

To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, the words, \u201cI\u2019m from the WHO, and I\u2019m here to help\u201d should be the most terrifying words in the English language, after what we learned from the COVID fiasco.

And the fact that no governments or health officials have admitted their errors should convince us never to let them manage anything for us ever again. Why would we let them draw up an international treaty and new amendments to the existing International Health Regulations (IHR) that will bind our governments to obey the WHO\u2019s dictates forever? Those dictates, by the way, include vaccine development at breakneck speed, the power to enforce which drugs we may use and which drugs will be prohibited, and the requirement to monitor media for \u201cmisinformation\u201d and impose censorship on media so that only the WHO\u2019s public health narrative will be conveyed to the public. Which is a First Amendment violation. The WHO\u2019s Pandemic Treaty Draft Requires the Sharing of Potential Pandemic Pathogens. This is a Euphemism for Bioweapons Proliferation. Obviously, the best way to spare us from another pandemic is to immediately stop funding gain-of-function (GOF) research and get rid of all existing GOF organisms. Let all nations build huge bonfires and burn up their evil creations at the same time, while allowing other nations to inspect their biological facilities and records. But the WHO in its June 2023 Bureau Text of the Draft Pandemic Treaty has a plan that is the exact opposite of this.

Fauci, Tedros, and their ilk at the WHO, and those managing biodefense and biomedical research for nation states are on one side, the side that gains access to ever more potential biological weapons, and the rest of us are on the other, at their mercy. This poorly conceptualized plan used to be called proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\u2014and it is almost certainly illegal.

        "text":"Part 8. The Genomic Sequencing Conundrum And governments are to commit to building biolabs that must include genomic sequencing. No explanation has been forthcoming about why each nation needs to install its own genome sequencing laboratories. Of course, they would sequence the many viruses that will be detected as a result of the pathogen surveillance activities nations must perform, according to the WHO treaty draft. But the same techniques can be used to sequence human genomes. The fact that the EU, UK, and US are currently engaged in projects to sequence about 2 million of their citizens\u2019 genomes provides a hint they may want to collect additional genomes of Africans, Asians, and others. Genomic sequencing might fly as simply sharing state-of-the-art science with our less-developed neighbors. But it is curious that there is so much emphasis on genomics, compared to the absence of any discussion about developing repurposed drugs for pandemics in either the draft treaty or IHR amendments. Some might suppose the proposed treaty was a disguised business plan for the biodefense industry. We must not forget that virtually all developed nations, in lockstep, restricted the use of safe generic hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and related drugs during the pandemic. In retrospect, the only logical explanation for this unprecedented action was to preserve the market for expensive patentable drugs and vaccines, and possibly to prolong the pandemic. US law only allows unlicensed, emergency use authorized (EUA) vaccines and drugs to be used if there is no adequate, approved (licensed) and available drug for the same purpose. If the US government admitted that existing, approved drugs could prevent and\/or treat COVID, it would need to immediately revoke all the EUA vaccines and drugs for COVID. This is one explanation for why these drugs have been vilified and suppressed by our state and federal agencies. Genomes offer great potential profits, as they may reveal the secrets of immunity to certain diseases. However, they may also reveal genetic weaknesses at which weapons could be aimed. They may also provide the substrate for transhumanist experiments that could include designer babies, among other things. The latest version (aka the WHO Bureau draft) of the pandemic treaty can be accessed here. I provide screenshots below to illustrate additional points. Draft pages 10 and 11:",

        "text":"Part 9. New Vaccines Will be Rolled Out Under Radically Abbreviated Future Testing Protocols Vaccines normally take 10-15 years to be developed. In case you thought the COVID vaccines took too long to be rolled out (326 days from availability of the viral sequence to authorization of the first US COVID vaccine) the WHO treaty draft has plans to shorten testing. There will be new clinical trial platforms. Nations must increase clinical trial capacity. (Might that mean mandating people to be human subjects in out-of-the-way places like Africa, for example?) And there will be new \u201cmechanisms to facilitate the rapid interpretation of data from clinical trials\u201d as well as \u201cstrategies for managing liability risks.\u201d Draft page 14: Manufacturer and Government Liability for Vaccine Injuries Must be \u201cManaged\u201d Nations are supposed to use \u201cexisting relevant models\u201d as a reference for compensation of injuries due to pandemic vaccines. Of course, most countries do not have vaccine injury compensation schemes, and when they do the benefits are usually minimal. Is the US government\u2019s program to be a model of what gets implemented internationally? There is only one way under US law to obtain compensation for an injury sustained from an EUA product. This is because under the PREP Act, lawsuits against manufacturers, government administrators and medical personnel administering vaccines and drugs are prohibited. The sole US government scheme for injuries due to COVID pandemic products is called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP. It is extremely difficult to obtain any benefits through this program, even if your doctors assert that your injury resulted from an EUA product. Therefore, few people bother to apply, and few are even aware the program exists. The statute of limitations for the CICP is a very brief twelve months, which means you must have documented that your injury was due to a vaccine or drug within 12 months of receiving the medical product. This can be extremely difficult when the federal health agencies deny such injuries exist. Furthermore, the program will only pay for lost wages or health expenses that have not been covered by insurance. The CICP is a \u201cpayor of last resort,\u201d so if your health insurance covered your injury and your disability insurance covered lost wages, you are ineligible to collect benefits. The CICP will provide no compensation for attorney fees, expert witnesses, document preparation or pain and suffering, although the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for childhood vaccine injuries pays those costs. There is no time limit by which a case must be adjudicated, so most cases languish for years without a decision. The program is purely administrative, and decisions regarding eligibility for benefits are made by the DHHS. There are no courts or judges and no published standards. All pandemic EUA drugs and vaccines convey immunity from legal liability to their manufacturers and to everyone else involved in their use. The CICP has compensated exactly 4 (yes, four) of the 12,000 applications for COVID product-related injuries as of August 1, 2023. The total amount paid out for the first 3 of the 4 compensated claims was $4,635, or less than $1,600 apiece, on average. Slightly more than 1,000 claims have been adjudicated, while 10,887 are pending review. In summary, 2% of the COVID cases reviewed by the CICP were deemed eligible for benefits, while only 0.03% of all COVID injury applications have received a payment from the CICP. No wonder so few people even bother to apply.",

        "text":"Part 2. A Biological Weapons Convention Amid great pushback over US conduct in Vietnam, and seeking to burnish his presidency, President Nixon announced to the world in November 1969 that the US was going to end its biowarfare program (but not the chemical program). Following pointed reminders that Nixon had not eschewed the use of toxins, in February 1970 Nixon announced we would also get rid of our toxin weapons also, which included snake, snail, frog, fish, bacterial, and fungal toxins that could be used for assassinations and other purposes. It has been claimed that Nixon\u2019s declarations resulted from careful calculations that the US was far ahead technically of most other nations in its chemical and nuclear weapons. But biological weapons were considered the \u201cpoor man\u2019s atomic bomb\u201d and required much less sophistication to produce. Therefore, the US was not far ahead in the biological weapons arena. By banning this class of weapon, the US would gain strategically. Nixon told the world that the US would initiate an international treaty to prevent the use of these weapons ever again. And we did so: the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, or Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) for short, which entered into force in 1975. But in 1973 genetic engineering (recombinant DNA) was discovered by Americans Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen, which changed the biological warfare calculus. Now the US had regained a technological advantage for this type of endeavor. The Biological Weapons Convention established conferences to be held every 5 years to strengthen the treaty. The expectation was that these would add a method to call for \u2018challenge inspections\u2019 to prevent nations from cheating and would add sanctions (punishments) if nations failed to comply with the treaty. However, since 1991 the US has consistently blocked the addition of protocols that would have an impact on cheating. By now, everyone accepts that cheating occurs and is likely widespread. A leak in an anthrax production facility in Sverdlovsk, USSR in 1979 caused the deaths of about 60 people. While the USSR tried a sloppy cover-up, blaming contaminated black market meat, this was a clear BWC violation to all those knowledgeable about anthrax. US experiments with anthrax production during the Clinton administration, detailed by Judith Miller et al. in the 2001 book Germs, were also thought by experts to have transgressed the BWC. It has taken over 40 years, but in 2022 all declared stocks of chemical weapons had been destroyed by the USA, by Russia, and the other 191 member nation signatories. The chemical weapons convention does include provisions for surprise inspections and sanctions. It is now 2023, and during the 48 years the Biological Weapons Convention has been in force the wall it was supposed to build against the development, production, and use of biological weapons has been steadily eroded. Meanwhile, especially since the 2001 anthrax letters, nations (with the US at the forefront) have been building up their \u201cbiodefense\u201d and \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d capacities. Under the guise of preparing their defenses against biowarfare and pandemics, nations have conducted \u201cdual-use\u201d (both offensive and defensive) research and development, which has led to the creation of more deadly and more transmissible microorganisms. And employing new verbiage to shield this effort from scrutiny, biological warfare research was renamed as \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research.",

        "text":"Part 8. The Genomic Sequencing Conundrum And governments are to commit to building biolabs that must include genomic sequencing. No explanation has been forthcoming about why each nation needs to install its own genome sequencing laboratories. Of course, they would sequence the many viruses that will be detected as a result of the pathogen surveillance activities nations must perform, according to the WHO treaty draft. But the same techniques can be used to sequence human genomes. The fact that the EU, UK, and US are currently engaged in projects to sequence about 2 million of their citizens\u2019 genomes provides a hint they may want to collect additional genomes of Africans, Asians, and others. Genomic sequencing might fly as simply sharing state-of-the-art science with our less-developed neighbors. But it is curious that there is so much emphasis on genomics, compared to the absence of any discussion about developing repurposed drugs for pandemics in either the draft treaty or IHR amendments. Some might suppose the proposed treaty was a disguised business plan for the biodefense industry. We must not forget that virtually all developed nations, in lockstep, restricted the use of safe generic hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and related drugs during the pandemic. In retrospect, the only logical explanation for this unprecedented action was to preserve the market for expensive patentable drugs and vaccines, and possibly to prolong the pandemic. US law only allows unlicensed, emergency use authorized (EUA) vaccines and drugs to be used if there is no adequate, approved (licensed) and available drug for the same purpose. If the US government admitted that existing, approved drugs could prevent and\/or treat COVID, it would need to immediately revoke all the EUA vaccines and drugs for COVID. This is one explanation for why these drugs have been vilified and suppressed by our state and federal agencies. Genomes offer great potential profits, as they may reveal the secrets of immunity to certain diseases. However, they may also reveal genetic weaknesses at which weapons could be aimed. They may also provide the substrate for transhumanist experiments that could include designer babies, among other things. The latest version (aka the WHO Bureau draft) of the pandemic treaty can be accessed here. I provide screenshots below to illustrate additional points. Draft pages 10 and 11:",

        "text":"Part 4. Maiming with Myocarditis Both of the two US monkeypox\/smallpox vaccines (Jynneos and ACAM2000) are known to cause myocarditis, as do all 3 COVID vaccines currently available in the US: the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the Novavax vaccine. The Novavax vaccine was first associated with myocarditis during its clinical trial, but this was downplayed, and it was authorized and rolled out anyway. The Novavax vaccine was considered a solution for those who refused the mRNA vaccines due to the use of fetal tissue in their manufacture. Here is what the FDA\u2019s reviewers wrote about the cardiac side effects noted in the Jynneos clinical trials: Up to 18.4% of subjects in 2 studies developed post-vaccination elevation of troponin [a cardiac muscle enzyme signifying cardiac damage]. However, all of these troponin elevations were asymptomatic and without a clinically associated event or other sign of myopericarditis. p. 198 The applicant has committed to conduct an observational, post-marketing study as part of their routine PVP. The sponsor will collect data on cardiac events that occur and are assessed as a routine part of medical care. p. 200 In other words, while the only way to cause an elevated troponin level is to break down cardiac muscle cells, the FDA did not require a specific study to evaluate the extent of cardiac damage that might be caused by Jynneos when it issued the vaccine\u2019s 2019 license. How frequently does myocarditis occur after these vaccines? If you use elevated cardiac enzymes as your marker, ACAM2000 caused this in one in thirty people receiving it for the first time. If you use other measures like abnormal cardiac MRI or echo, according to the CDC it occurs in one in 175 vaccinees. I have not seen a study with rates of myocarditis for Jynneos, but there was an unspecified elevation of cardiac enzymes in 10 percent and 18 percent of Jynneos recipients in two unpublished prelicensure studies available on the FDA website. My guess for the mRNA COVID vaccines is that they cause myocarditis in this general range (between 1 in 10 and 1 in 250 recipients per dose), while the vast majority of cases are probably asymptomatic and never diagnosed. Why would our governments push 5 separate vaccines all known to cause myocarditis on young people who are at extremely low risk from COVID? Monkeypox simply causes a few eruptions (like shingles) for 1-4 weeks unless the infected person is severely immunocompromised. Why dangerous vaccines are being pushed on young, low-risk populations for whom the health risks from vaccination are considerably greater than the risks from the disease is an important question. It does not make medical sense. Especially for a vaccine that probably does not work. Jynneos didn\u2019t prevent infection in the monkeys in whom it was tested, nor did it do well in people. And the CDC has failed to publish its trial of Jynneos vaccine in the ~1,600 Congolese healthcare workers in whom the CDC tested it for efficacy and safety in 2017. The CDC announced it was conducting the trial, and posted it to clinicaltrials.gov as required, but has not informed its advisory committee that reviewed the vaccine, nor the public, of the trial\u2019s results. We can safely guess that had the vaccine been safe and effective in its only field trial, CDC\u2019s advisors and the public would have been informed. There can be no question about it: our health agencies are guilty of malfeasance, misrepresentation, and deliberate infliction of harm on their own populations.",

        "text":"Part 5. COVID Vaccines: The Chicken or the Egg? The health authorities could have just been ignorant\u2014that could possibly explain the first few months of the COVID vaccines\u2019 rollout. But once they figured out, and even announced in August 2021 that vaccines did not prevent catching COVID or transmitting it, why did our health authorities mandate COVID vaccines for 100 million mostly low-risk Americans who were clearly at greater risk from vaccine side effects than from COVID? And why did they double down on mandates as time went on and newer variants were less and less virulent? And that wasn\u2019t all the federal authorities did. Understanding that mandates could not legally be issued unless the vaccines were licensed (not just authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)) FDA issued a license for the Pfizer vaccine on August 23, 2021. It is important to understand that the licensed vaccine had liability attached: if it caused injuries, the manufacturer could be sued for damages. While the authorized (EUA) COVID vaccines had all liability waived for the manufacturers, government officials and healthcare workers administering them under the PREP Act. So the FDA performed a deliberate bait and switch. It led Americans to believe they were receiving a licensed product that had gone through a full FDA approval process, when in fact what they actually received was the EUA product that was unlicensed, and for which they could not sue if injured. FDA hid this by using peculiar language when it issued the license to Pfizer, by claiming the two vaccines were \u201clegally distinct\u201d in a footnote. Once you understand these basic facts, you realize that perhaps the vaccines were not made for the pandemic, and instead the pandemic was made to roll out the vaccines. While we cannot be certain, we should at least be suspicious. And the fact that the US contracted for 10 doses per person (review purchases here, here, here, here and here) and so did the European Union (here and here) and Canada should make us even more suspicious. There is no medical justification for agreeing to purchase so many doses for vaccines at a time when at a time when the virus was rapidly mutating, the vaccines\u2019 ability to prevent infection and transmission was questionable and its safety was suspect or worse. Australia bought 8 doses per person. By December 20, 2020 New Zealand had secured triple the vaccines it needed, and offered to share some with nearby nations. Why would governments buy so many doses per person? Three maybe. But ten? Even if yearly boosters were expected, there was no reason to sign contracts for enough vaccine for nine years. No one has ever explained the reason for these excessive, lockstep purchases by so many nations. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need a vaccine passport (aka digital ID, aka a phone app that in Europe included a mechanism for an electronic payments system) unless you are monitoring whether people are up to date on their boosters. Were the vaccines conceived of as the means for putting our vaccinations and most importantly, shifting our financial transactions online, all to be managed on a phone app? This would be an attack on privacy as well as the enabling step for a China-style social credit system in the West. Interestingly, vaccine passports were already being planned for the European Union pre-COVID, in 2018. Why?",

        "text":"Part 3. How Would You Create a Biological Warfare Agent? Gain-of-function is a euphemism for biological warfare research aka germ warfare research. It is so risky that funding it was banned by the US government (but only for SARS coronaviruses and avian flu viruses) in 2014 after a public outcry from hundreds of scientists. Then in 2017 Drs. Tony Fauci and Francis Collins lifted the moratorium, with no real safeguards in place. Fauci and Collins even had the temerity to publish their opinion that the risk from this gain-of-function research was \u2018worth it.\u2019 What does gain-of-function actually mean? It means that scientists are able to use a variety of techniques to turn ordinary or pathogenic viruses and bacteria into biological weapons. The research is justified by the claim that scientists can get out ahead of nature and predict what might be a future pandemic threat, or what another nation might use as a bioweapon. The functions gained by the viruses or other microorganisms to turn them into biological warfare agents consist of two categories: enhanced transmission or enhanced pathogenicity (illness severity). 1) Enhanced transmissibility may result from: a) needing fewer viral or bacterial copies to cause infection, b) causing the generation of higher viral or bacterial titers, c) a new mode of spread, such as adding airborne transmission to a virus that previously only spread through bodily fluids, d) expanding the range of susceptible organs (aka expanded tissue tropism); for example, not only respiratory secretions but also urine or stool might transmit the virus, which was found in SARS-CoV-2, e) expanding the host range; for example, the virus is passaged through humanized mice and thus acclimated to the human ACE-2 receptor, infecting humans preferably to bats or other animals, which was found in SARS-CoV-2, f) improving the ability to enter cells; for example, by adding a furin cleavage site, which was found in SARS-CoV-2, 2) increased pathogenicity, so instead of causing a milder illness, the pathogen would be made to cause severe illness or death, using various methods. SARS-CoV-2 had unusual homologies (identical short segments) to human tissues and the HIV virus, which may have caused or contributed to the late autoimmune stage of illness, impaired immune response and \u2018long COVID.\u2019 Funding for (Natural) Pandemics, Including Yearly Influenza, was Lumped Together with Biological Defense Funding Perhaps the comingling of funding was designed to make it harder for Congress and the public to understand what was being funded, and how much taxpayer funding was going to gain-of-function work? Understanding the huge sums involved might have led Americans to question why this research was being done at all, given its prohibition by the Biological Weapons Convention, and could have raised additional questions about its lack of value to human health. Former CDC Director Robert Redfield, a physician and virologist, told Congress in March of 2023 that gain-of-function research had not resulted in a single beneficial drug, vaccine, or therapeutic to his knowledge. So-called Nonprofits and universities (like Eco Health Alliance and its affiliation with Professor Jonna Mazet at the University of California, Davis veterinary school) were used as intermediaries to obscure the fact that US taxpayers were supporting scientists in dozens of foreign countries, including China, for research that included gain-of-function work on coronaviruses. Perhaps to keep the lucrative funding going, fears about pandemics have been deliberately amplified over the past several decades. The federal government has been spending huge sums on pandemic preparedness over the past 20 years, routing it through many federal and state agencies. President Biden\u2019s proposed 2024 CDC budget requested \u201c$20 billion in mandatory funding across DHHS for pandemic preparedness\u201d while the DHS, DOD, USAID and the State Department have additional budgets for pandemic preparedness for both domestic and international projects. The current jargon for this spending is pandemic prevention, preparedness and response or PPPR. While this may be a feel-good way for politicians to spend money, scientifically there is no known way to prevent pandemics, and the methods that governments are spending money on are actually going to make this problem a great deal worse. The concept of a \u201cresponse\u201d: withholding cheap, available generic drugs in favor of the warp speed development of patentable drugs and vaccines, which will undergo minimal testing and have no liability, is another disaster in the making. Pandemic preparedness is a myth, a smokescreen behind which lies a fascist approach to social management. The Steady Drumbeat of Pandemic Fear Although the 20th century experienced only 3 significant pandemics (the Spanish flu of 1918-19 and 2 influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968) the mass media and World Health Organization have presented us with almost non-stop pandemics during the 21st century: SARS-1 (2002-3), avian flu (2004-on), swine flu (2009-10), Ebola (2014, 2018-19), Zika (2016), COVID (2020-2023), and monkeypox (2022-23). And we are incessantly told that more are coming, and that they are likely to be worse. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared three \u201cpublic health emergencies of international concern\u201d during his six years in office. We have been assaulted with warnings and threats for over 2 decades to induce a deep fear of infectious diseases. It seems to have worked. The genomes of both SARS-CoV-2 (start at minute 5) and the 2022 monkeypox (MPOX) virus lead to suspicion that both were bioengineered pathogens originating in laboratories. The group of virologists assembled by Drs. Fauci and Farrar identified 6 unusual (probably lab-derived) parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as early as February 1, 2020 and more have been suggested subsequently. I do not know if these viruses leaked accidentally or were deliberately released, but I am leaning toward the conclusion that both were deliberately released, based on the locations where they first appeared, the well-orchestrated but faked videos rolled out by the mass media for COVID, and the illogical and harmful official responses to each. In neither case was the public given accurate information about the infections\u2019 severity or treatments, and the responses by Western governments never made scientific sense. Why wouldn\u2019t you treat cases early, the way doctors treat everything else? It seemed that our governments were trading on the fact that few people knew enough about viruses and therapeutics to make independent assessments about the information they were being fed. Yet by July and August 2021, there was no corresponding course correction. Instead, the federal government doubled down, imposing vaccine mandates on 100 million Americans in September 2021 in spite of \u2018the science.\u2019 There has been no accurate statement yet from any federal agency about the lack of utility of cotton and surgical masks for an airborne virus (which is probably why the US government and WHO delayed acknowledging airborne spread by COVID for many months), the lack of efficacy of social distancing for an airborne virus, and the risks and poor efficacy of 2 dangerous oral drugs (paxlovid and molnupiravir) purchased by the US government for COVID treatment, even without a doctor\u2019s prescription. Never have any federal agencies acknowledged the truth about the COVID vaccines\u2019 safety and efficacy. Instead, the CDC turns definitional and statistical cartwheels so it can continue to claim they are \u201csafe and effective.\u201d Even worse, with all that we know, a third generation COVID vaccine is to be rolled out for this fall and the FDA has announced that yearly boosters are planned. All this goes on, even a year after we learned (with continuing corroborations) that children and working age adults are dying at rates 25 percent or more above the expected averages, and the vascular side effects of vaccination are the only reasonable explanation.",

        "text":"Part 10. What About Human Rights? The need to respect \u201chuman rights, dignity, and freedom of persons\u201d is embedded in the current International Health Regulations (IHR), as well as other UN treaties. However, the language guaranteeing human rights, dignity, and freedom of persons was peremptorily removed from the proposed IHR Amendments, without explanation. The removal of human rights protections did not go unnoticed, and the WHO has been widely criticized for it. The WHO apparently is responding to these criticisms, and so the language guaranteeing human rights that was removed from the drafts of the International Health Regulations has been inserted into the newest version of the pandemic treaty. Conclusions As long predicted by science fiction, our biotech, cyber and surveillance achievements have finally gotten away from us. We can produce vaccines in 100 days and manufacture them in 130 days\u2013but there will be no guarantees that the products will be safe, effective, or adequately manufactured. And we can expect large profits, but no consequences for the legally shielded manufacturers and government officials from any injuries to the public. If we do face another pandemic, being able to access repurposed drugs will be the only rapid and safe solution. Yet existing drugs have been deliberately excluded by the WHO\u2019s IHR amendments and treaty draft, because no one gets rich off non-patentable and available old drugs. Our genes can be decoded by genomic sequencing, and the fruits of personalized medicine made available to us. Or perhaps our genes will be patented and sold to the highest bidder. We might be able to select for special characteristics in our children, but at the same time, a human underclass of test-tube babies could be created. Our electronic communications can be completely monitored and censored, and uniform messaging can be imposed on everyone. But for whom would this be good? New biological weapons will be discovered or engineered. They will be shared. This virtually guarantees future pandemics. We can hope the GOF research that studied and created them will speed up the development of vaccines and therapeutics for the public, but it never has so far. Who really benefits from the gain-of-function scam? Those who seek to control us. It is the public who pays the cost of the research, then pays again for the accidents and deliberate leaks. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to end gain-of-function research entirely, by restricting funding or closing the laboratories, rather than encouraging the proliferation of biological weapons? If we want a decent future, it is crucial that we control these weapons instead of proliferating them. Centralized dictates for managing the COVID pandemic resulted in catastrophe. Wouldn\u2019t we be insane to allow the WHO to control our responses to future pandemics? These are important issues for all of humanity, and I encourage everyone to pay attention to them, think about them, and become part of this very important conversation.",

Draft page 14: But the problem is that you cannot prevent escapes and unintended consequences when you perform this type of research. Leaks and losses of agents will always occur. Smallpox leaked out of British labs several times. After the same lab caused two smallpox outbreaks, the scientist responsible for the lab committed suicide in 1980. There were six identified lab escapes of SARS-1 in China, Singapore and Taiwan in 2003 and 2004. The joint CDC-USDA Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) keeps track of research on designated potential pandemic pathogens, including for example, SARS coronaviruses, anthrax and Ebola. As the FSAP describes itself, \u201cThe Federal Select Agent Program oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins, which have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products.\u201d FSAP reports reveal that there are about 200 accidents or escapes yearly from labs situated in the US. (There is no accounting of accidents outside the US.) The FSAP annual report for 2021 notes: \u201cIn 2021, FSAP received 8 reports of losses, 177 reports of releases, and no reports of thefts.\u201d While scientists do their best to protect themselves and maintain lab safety, research on deadly pathogens simply cannot be performed without risks both to the researchers and the outside world.",

        "text":"Part 10. What About Human Rights? The need to respect \u201chuman rights, dignity, and freedom of persons\u201d is embedded in the current International Health Regulations (IHR), as well as other UN treaties. However, the language guaranteeing human rights, dignity, and freedom of persons was peremptorily removed from the proposed IHR Amendments, without explanation. The removal of human rights protections did not go unnoticed, and the WHO has been widely criticized for it. The WHO apparently is responding to these criticisms, and so the language guaranteeing human rights that was removed from the drafts of the International Health Regulations has been inserted into the newest version of the pandemic treaty. Conclusions As long predicted by science fiction, our biotech, cyber and surveillance achievements have finally gotten away from us. We can produce vaccines in 100 days and manufacture them in 130 days\u2013but there will be no guarantees that the products will be safe, effective, or adequately manufactured. And we can expect large profits, but no consequences for the legally shielded manufacturers and government officials from any injuries to the public. If we do face another pandemic, being able to access repurposed drugs will be the only rapid and safe solution. Yet existing drugs have been deliberately excluded by the WHO\u2019s IHR amendments and treaty draft, because no one gets rich off non-patentable and available old drugs. Our genes can be decoded by genomic sequencing, and the fruits of personalized medicine made available to us. Or perhaps our genes will be patented and sold to the highest bidder. We might be able to select for special characteristics in our children, but at the same time, a human underclass of test-tube babies could be created. Our electronic communications can be completely monitored and censored, and uniform messaging can be imposed on everyone. But for whom would this be good? New biological weapons will be discovered or engineered. They will be shared. This virtually guarantees future pandemics. We can hope the GOF research that studied and created them will speed up the development of vaccines and therapeutics for the public, but it never has so far. Who really benefits from the gain-of-function scam? Those who seek to control us. It is the public who pays the cost of the research, then pays again for the accidents and deliberate leaks. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to end gain-of-function research entirely, by restricting funding or closing the laboratories, rather than encouraging the proliferation of biological weapons? If we want a decent future, it is crucial that we control these weapons instead of proliferating them. Centralized dictates for managing the COVID pandemic resulted in catastrophe. Wouldn\u2019t we be insane to allow the WHO to control our responses to future pandemics? These are important issues for all of humanity, and I encourage everyone to pay attention to them, think about them, and become part of this very important conversation.",

        "text":"Part 2. A Biological Weapons Convention Amid great pushback over US conduct in Vietnam, and seeking to burnish his presidency, President Nixon announced to the world in November 1969 that the US was going to end its biowarfare program (but not the chemical program). Following pointed reminders that Nixon had not eschewed the use of toxins, in February 1970 Nixon announced we would also get rid of our toxin weapons also, which included snake, snail, frog, fish, bacterial, and fungal toxins that could be used for assassinations and other purposes. It has been claimed that Nixon\u2019s declarations resulted from careful calculations that the US was far ahead technically of most other nations in its chemical and nuclear weapons. But biological weapons were considered the \u201cpoor man\u2019s atomic bomb\u201d and required much less sophistication to produce. Therefore, the US was not far ahead in the biological weapons arena. By banning this class of weapon, the US would gain strategically. Nixon told the world that the US would initiate an international treaty to prevent the use of these weapons ever again. And we did so: the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, or Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) for short, which entered into force in 1975. But in 1973 genetic engineering (recombinant DNA) was discovered by Americans Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen, which changed the biological warfare calculus. Now the US had regained a technological advantage for this type of endeavor. The Biological Weapons Convention established conferences to be held every 5 years to strengthen the treaty. The expectation was that these would add a method to call for \u2018challenge inspections\u2019 to prevent nations from cheating and would add sanctions (punishments) if nations failed to comply with the treaty. However, since 1991 the US has consistently blocked the addition of protocols that would have an impact on cheating. By now, everyone accepts that cheating occurs and is likely widespread. A leak in an anthrax production facility in Sverdlovsk, USSR in 1979 caused the deaths of about 60 people. While the USSR tried a sloppy cover-up, blaming contaminated black market meat, this was a clear BWC violation to all those knowledgeable about anthrax. US experiments with anthrax production during the Clinton administration, detailed by Judith Miller et al. in the 2001 book Germs, were also thought by experts to have transgressed the BWC. It has taken over 40 years, but in 2022 all declared stocks of chemical weapons had been destroyed by the USA, by Russia, and the other 191 member nation signatories. The chemical weapons convention does include provisions for surprise inspections and sanctions. It is now 2023, and during the 48 years the Biological Weapons Convention has been in force the wall it was supposed to build against the development, production, and use of biological weapons has been steadily eroded. Meanwhile, especially since the 2001 anthrax letters, nations (with the US at the forefront) have been building up their \u201cbiodefense\u201d and \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d capacities. Under the guise of preparing their defenses against biowarfare and pandemics, nations have conducted \u201cdual-use\u201d (both offensive and defensive) research and development, which has led to the creation of more deadly and more transmissible microorganisms. And employing new verbiage to shield this effort from scrutiny, biological warfare research was renamed as \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research.",

We start with a history of biological arms control and rapidly move to the COVID pandemic, eventually arriving at plans to protect the future. Pt.1: Weapons of Mass Destruction: Chem\/Bio Traditionally, the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) have been labelled Chemical, Biological, Radiologic, and Nuclear (CBRN). The people of the world don\u2019t want them used on us\u2014for they are cheap ways to kill and maim large numbers of people quickly. And so international treaties were created to try to prevent their development (only in the later treaties) and use (in all the biological arms control treaties). First was the Geneva Protocol of 1925, following the use of poison gases and limited biological weapons in World War I, banning the use of biological and chemical weapons in war. The US and many nations signed it, but it took 50 years for the US to ratify it, and during those 50 years the US asserted it was not bound by the treaty. The US used both biological and chemical weapons during those 50 years. The US almost certainly used biological weapons in the Korean War (see this, this, this and this) and perhaps used both in Vietnam, which experienced an odd outbreak of plague during the war. The use of napalm, white phosphorus, agent orange (with its dioxin excipient causing massive numbers of birth defects and other tragedies) and probably other chemical weapons like BZ(ahallucinogen\/incapacitant) led to much pushback, especially since we had signed the Geneva Protocol and we were supposed to be a civilized nation. In 1968 and 1969, two important books were published that had a great influence on the American psyche regarding our massive stockpiling and use of these agents. The first book, written by a young Seymour Hersh about the US chemical and biological warfare program, was titled Chemical and Biological Warfare; America\u2019s Hidden Arsenal. In 1969 Congressman Richard D. McCarthy, a former newspaperman from Buffalo, NY wrote the book The Ultimate Folly: War by Pestilence, Asphyxiation and Defoliation about the US production and use of chemical and biological weapons. Prof. Matthew Meselson\u2019s review of the book noted, Our operation, \u201cFlying Ranch Hand,\u201d has sprayed anti-plant chemicals over an area almost the size of the state of Massachusetts, over 10 per cent of its cropland. \u201cRanch Hand\u201d no longer has much to do with the official justification of preventing ambush. Rather, it has become a kind of environmental warfare, devastating vast tracts of forest in order to facilitate our aerial reconnaissance. Our use of \u201csuper tear gas\u201d (it is also a powerful lung irritant) has escalated from the originally announced purpose of saving lives in \u201criot control-like situations\u201d to the full-scale combat use of gas artillery shells, gas rockets and gas bombs to enhance the killing power of conventional high explosive and flame weapons. Fourteen million pounds have been used thus far, enough to cover all of Vietnam with a field effective concentration. Many nations, including some of our own allies have expressed the opinion that this kind of gas warfare violates the Geneva Protocol, a view shared by McCarthy.",

        "text":"Part 5. COVID Vaccines: The Chicken or the Egg? The health authorities could have just been ignorant\u2014that could possibly explain the first few months of the COVID vaccines\u2019 rollout. But once they figured out, and even announced in August 2021 that vaccines did not prevent catching COVID or transmitting it, why did our health authorities mandate COVID vaccines for 100 million mostly low-risk Americans who were clearly at greater risk from vaccine side effects than from COVID? And why did they double down on mandates as time went on and newer variants were less and less virulent? And that wasn\u2019t all the federal authorities did. Understanding that mandates could not legally be issued unless the vaccines were licensed (not just authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)) FDA issued a license for the Pfizer vaccine on August 23, 2021. It is important to understand that the licensed vaccine had liability attached: if it caused injuries, the manufacturer could be sued for damages. While the authorized (EUA) COVID vaccines had all liability waived for the manufacturers, government officials and healthcare workers administering them under the PREP Act. So the FDA performed a deliberate bait and switch. It led Americans to believe they were receiving a licensed product that had gone through a full FDA approval process, when in fact what they actually received was the EUA product that was unlicensed, and for which they could not sue if injured. FDA hid this by using peculiar language when it issued the license to Pfizer, by claiming the two vaccines were \u201clegally distinct\u201d in a footnote. Once you understand these basic facts, you realize that perhaps the vaccines were not made for the pandemic, and instead the pandemic was made to roll out the vaccines. While we cannot be certain, we should at least be suspicious. And the fact that the US contracted for 10 doses per person (review purchases here, here, here, here and here) and so did the European Union (here and here) and Canada should make us even more suspicious. There is no medical justification for agreeing to purchase so many doses for vaccines at a time when at a time when the virus was rapidly mutating, the vaccines\u2019 ability to prevent infection and transmission was questionable and its safety was suspect or worse. Australia bought 8 doses per person. By December 20, 2020 New Zealand had secured triple the vaccines it needed, and offered to share some with nearby nations. Why would governments buy so many doses per person? Three maybe. But ten? Even if yearly boosters were expected, there was no reason to sign contracts for enough vaccine for nine years. No one has ever explained the reason for these excessive, lockstep purchases by so many nations. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need a vaccine passport (aka digital ID, aka a phone app that in Europe included a mechanism for an electronic payments system) unless you are monitoring whether people are up to date on their boosters. Were the vaccines conceived of as the means for putting our vaccinations and most importantly, shifting our financial transactions online, all to be managed on a phone app? This would be an attack on privacy as well as the enabling step for a China-style social credit system in the West. Interestingly, vaccine passports were already being planned for the European Union pre-COVID, in 2018. Why?",

        "text":"Part 4. Maiming with Myocarditis Both of the two US monkeypox\/smallpox vaccines (Jynneos and ACAM2000) are known to cause myocarditis, as do all 3 COVID vaccines currently available in the US: the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the Novavax vaccine. The Novavax vaccine was first associated with myocarditis during its clinical trial, but this was downplayed, and it was authorized and rolled out anyway. The Novavax vaccine was considered a solution for those who refused the mRNA vaccines due to the use of fetal tissue in their manufacture. Here is what the FDA\u2019s reviewers wrote about the cardiac side effects noted in the Jynneos clinical trials: Up to 18.4% of subjects in 2 studies developed post-vaccination elevation of troponin [a cardiac muscle enzyme signifying cardiac damage]. However, all of these troponin elevations were asymptomatic and without a clinically associated event or other sign of myopericarditis. p. 198 The applicant has committed to conduct an observational, post-marketing study as part of their routine PVP. The sponsor will collect data on cardiac events that occur and are assessed as a routine part of medical care. p. 200 In other words, while the only way to cause an elevated troponin level is to break down cardiac muscle cells, the FDA did not require a specific study to evaluate the extent of cardiac damage that might be caused by Jynneos when it issued the vaccine\u2019s 2019 license. How frequently does myocarditis occur after these vaccines? If you use elevated cardiac enzymes as your marker, ACAM2000 caused this in one in thirty people receiving it for the first time. If you use other measures like abnormal cardiac MRI or echo, according to the CDC it occurs in one in 175 vaccinees. I have not seen a study with rates of myocarditis for Jynneos, but there was an unspecified elevation of cardiac enzymes in 10 percent and 18 percent of Jynneos recipients in two unpublished prelicensure studies available on the FDA website. My guess for the mRNA COVID vaccines is that they cause myocarditis in this general range (between 1 in 10 and 1 in 250 recipients per dose), while the vast majority of cases are probably asymptomatic and never diagnosed. Why would our governments push 5 separate vaccines all known to cause myocarditis on young people who are at extremely low risk from COVID? Monkeypox simply causes a few eruptions (like shingles) for 1-4 weeks unless the infected person is severely immunocompromised. Why dangerous vaccines are being pushed on young, low-risk populations for whom the health risks from vaccination are considerably greater than the risks from the disease is an important question. It does not make medical sense. Especially for a vaccine that probably does not work. Jynneos didn\u2019t prevent infection in the monkeys in whom it was tested, nor did it do well in people. And the CDC has failed to publish its trial of Jynneos vaccine in the ~1,600 Congolese healthcare workers in whom the CDC tested it for efficacy and safety in 2017. The CDC announced it was conducting the trial, and posted it to clinicaltrials.gov as required, but has not informed its advisory committee that reviewed the vaccine, nor the public, of the trial\u2019s results. We can safely guess that had the vaccine been safe and effective in its only field trial, CDC\u2019s advisors and the public would have been informed. There can be no question about it: our health agencies are guilty of malfeasance, misrepresentation, and deliberate infliction of harm on their own populations.",

The FSAP annual report for 2021 notes: \u201cIn 2021, FSAP received 8 reports of losses, 177 reports of releases, and no reports of thefts.\u201d While scientists do their best to protect themselves and maintain lab safety, research on deadly pathogens simply cannot be performed without risks both to the researchers and the outside world.",

        "text":"Part 9. New Vaccines Will be Rolled Out Under Radically Abbreviated Future Testing Protocols Vaccines normally take 10-15 years to be developed. In case you thought the COVID vaccines took too long to be rolled out (326 days from availability of the viral sequence to authorization of the first US COVID vaccine) the WHO treaty draft has plans to shorten testing. There will be new clinical trial platforms. Nations must increase clinical trial capacity. (Might that mean mandating people to be human subjects in out-of-the-way places like Africa, for example?) And there will be new \u201cmechanisms to facilitate the rapid interpretation of data from clinical trials\u201d as well as \u201cstrategies for managing liability risks.\u201d Draft page 14: Manufacturer and Government Liability for Vaccine Injuries Must be \u201cManaged\u201d Nations are supposed to use \u201cexisting relevant models\u201d as a reference for compensation of injuries due to pandemic vaccines. Of course, most countries do not have vaccine injury compensation schemes, and when they do the benefits are usually minimal. Is the US government\u2019s program to be a model of what gets implemented internationally? There is only one way under US law to obtain compensation for an injury sustained from an EUA product. This is because under the PREP Act, lawsuits against manufacturers, government administrators and medical personnel administering vaccines and drugs are prohibited. The sole US government scheme for injuries due to COVID pandemic products is called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP. It is extremely difficult to obtain any benefits through this program, even if your doctors assert that your injury resulted from an EUA product. Therefore, few people bother to apply, and few are even aware the program exists. The statute of limitations for the CICP is a very brief twelve months, which means you must have documented that your injury was due to a vaccine or drug within 12 months of receiving the medical product. This can be extremely difficult when the federal health agencies deny such injuries exist. Furthermore, the program will only pay for lost wages or health expenses that have not been covered by insurance. The CICP is a \u201cpayor of last resort,\u201d so if your health insurance covered your injury and your disability insurance covered lost wages, you are ineligible to collect benefits. The CICP will provide no compensation for attorney fees, expert witnesses, document preparation or pain and suffering, although the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for childhood vaccine injuries pays those costs. There is no time limit by which a case must be adjudicated, so most cases languish for years without a decision. The program is purely administrative, and decisions regarding eligibility for benefits are made by the DHHS. There are no courts or judges and no published standards. All pandemic EUA drugs and vaccines convey immunity from legal liability to their manufacturers and to everyone else involved in their use. The CICP has compensated exactly 4 (yes, four) of the 12,000 applications for COVID product-related injuries as of August 1, 2023. The total amount paid out for the first 3 of the 4 compensated claims was $4,635, or less than $1,600 apiece, on average. Slightly more than 1,000 claims have been adjudicated, while 10,887 are pending review. In summary, 2% of the COVID cases reviewed by the CICP were deemed eligible for benefits, while only 0.03% of all COVID injury applications have received a payment from the CICP. No wonder so few people even bother to apply.",

MILITARY INTEL: World Patriots, Rejoice: The Deep State\u2019s Second Pandemic Plot Unravels \u2013 United States Under Military Control \u2013 COG and Military Operations \u2013 The Event is Imminent! Medeea Greere, an independent publisher, is now on Telegram at https:\/\/t.me\/AMGNEWS2022 and exists only on reader support as we publish Truth, Freedom and Love for public awareness. Thank You for your support! Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Patriots and Freedom Fighters, this is a moment to celebrate, for your unyielding spirit has once again triumphed against the shadowy deep state and their globalist agenda. Your voices, and your unshakable commitment to the truth, have played a pivotal role in exposing the hidden agenda, thereby thwarting the second planned pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. The globalist deep state has been forced to abandon its malevolent scheme thanks to the MASSIVE AWAKENING INFORMATION CAMPAIGN! Across more than 100 nations, their sinister plan has crumbled, with fewer than 5% of Americans succumbing to their booster shot agenda. Across the globe, consensus has been reached that the world refuses to bow to new lockdowns, and most now see a sinister elite agenda lurking behind the pandemic, vaccines, and lockdowns. Moreover, nations are awakening to the stark corruption undermining their two-tier governments, suppressing human rights, and censoring freedom of speech! \u201cSecret Vaxx Warehouses \u2013 A Billion-Dollar Fiasco\u201d Behind closed doors, the colossal failure of vaccine storage and distribution unfolds. Warehouses across the globe are overflowing, and the blunders are costing BlackRock and others hundreds of billions as vaccines languish without proper storage and cooling. Quietly, these vaccines are being destroyed, making this revelation a powerful testament to our fight against the deep state cabal. \u201cThe Power of the Great Awakening\u201d This moment signifies a monumental victory against the deep state cabal and underscores the potency of the Great Awakening, spreading like wildfire worldwide. Your voices are the antidote to the deep state\u2019s lies, overcoming mainstream media misinformation, social media censorship, government suppression, and globalist narratives. \u201cDeep State Panic and the WW3 Scheme\u201d As the globalist cabal panics, they endeavor to concoct a WW3 scenario to fuel their illicit money laundering operations, extracting trillions from the U.S., EU, Canada, Australia, Israel, and the puppet Ukrainian regime controlled by the CIA. But their war machinations have crumbled as Ukraine\u2019s regime, feeling betrayed and abandoned, admits defeat. \u201cIsraeli Civil War Looms\u201d Behind the curtains in Israel, the military plans to remove Netanyahu, paving the way for tribunals. A civil war looms, scheduled for 2024, as over 80% of Israelis lose faith in their government. White hat military strategists are preparing intricate Game Theory Operations for a bloodless military coup. \u201cRevelations Await in 2024\u201d In 2024, brace for groundbreaking revelations as military white hats and courageous individuals in the medical, government, and the broader pharmaceutical industry unleash hidden data on vaccine tests, fatalities, damages, and the corrupt agendas of global investment giants such as BlackRock, who manipulated, bribed, blackmailed, and laundered money to push through COVID-19 vaccines. \u25ba Big Pharma Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know About Alternative: How to Make Natural Morphine At Home Using This Powerful Medicinal Plant \u201cGlobal Riots and Protests\u201d A wave of worldwide unrest will sweep through the streets, targeting the establishment in the medical, big pharma, big tech, and industries entwined with governments, presidents, and regimes beholden to globalist agendas and control. The depopulation agenda will cease to be a conspiracy, as the U.S. Congress launches investigations, intersecting with the 2024 election interference and the previous 2020 election meddling. \u201cA Planned Military Coup\u201d This looming storm will be masterfully framed by the white hats as a meticulously orchestrated military coup engineered by the globalists, in collusion with the likes of Obama, the CIA, Pentagon, and the DOJ, extending its reach to the European Union, Canada, Australia, and the rest of the world. Remember, Patriots, everything converges towards Q. \u201cTrust the Plan, Military Is the Only Way\u201d Place your trust in the plan, for the military stands as the only bastion against the encroaching darkness. The Event is imminent! United States Under Military Control \u2013 The Hidden Web of COG and Military Operations The United States finds itself under the shroud of military control. While the concept of Continuity of Government (COG) was initially established to ensure the government\u2019s survival in nuclear war scenarios, recent events have demonstrated its application far beyond its intended scope. The activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks has paved the way for the covert and overt integration of military laws of war. As we delve into this paradigm shift, we unveil a concealed realm where presidential powers, executive orders, and military occupation converge in a labyrinthine fusion of control. In an era of unprecedented uncertainty and global turmoil, the United States\u2019 operational stability has been thrust into the spotlight. Beyond the public eye, a complex web of strategies and protocols has been set in motion, bringing the nation\u2019s governance, security, and sovereignty into question. The term \u201cContinuity of Government\u201d (COG) once solely invoked visions of nuclear war and catastrophic scenarios; today, it stands as the sentinel of an intricate framework with far-reaching implications. COG\u2019s Evolution Beyond Nuclear Threats: Traditionally conceived as a safeguard against nuclear warfare, the COG principle took an unanticipated turn in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The nation awoke to a new reality: an adaptive and resilient governmental apparatus that could endure even the most catastrophic events. As the ashes of the Twin Towers settled, the Continuity of Operations Plan emerged from the shadows, acting as the blueprint for a government that refused to be paralyzed. Viral Content: Brace Yourselves\u2026 A Storm is Coming! You Just Have to Know Where to Look! Behind this transformation lies the intricate interplay between presidential powers and the Department of Defense. At the heart of this symbiosis are the Executive Orders, wielding the ability to unleash covert and overt military operations. The obscure depths of Chapter 11.3 Laws of War offer a tantalizing glimpse into the arsenal of measures that can be employed under the aegis of military occupation. Shrouded in secrecy and employing the dark arts of espionage, covert military operations have become the currency of this new era. Operating like ghosts in the shadows, these operations blur the lines between national security and individual privacy. The echoes of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations reverberate through this clandestine landscape, reminding us of the price paid for unchecked power. The Rise of Overt Military Control: As the cloak of secrecy parts, overt military control emerges as a stark reality. The echoes of martial footsteps reverberate through the corridors of power, as the Department of Defense steps into the limelight. The prospect of military law operating on domestic soil raises questions about the delicate balance between civil liberties and security imperatives. The narrative surrounding this seismic shift is a double-edged sword. On one side, proponents argue that the militarization of government is essential to ensure national survival in an increasingly chaotic world. On the other, skeptics point to the erosion of democratic norms, the veiling of autocratic tendencies, and the alarming lack of transparency that characterizes this new era. As we navigate this landscape of intrigue and power, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the distinct personality that pervades the proceedings. The scent of conspiracy, the adrenaline of secrecy, and the weight of responsibility hang thick in the air, creating a tapestry woven from the threads of human determination, ambition, and fear. When Major Broadcasters Unveil the Shadows: TRUMP, MUSK, CARLSON and the Rogan Twist An intense undercurrent in the media landscape reveals itself as major broadcasters and influential figures come to light, echoing a sentiment that\u2019s been whispered about for years. The nexus? Trump, Musk, Carlson, and an unexpected Rogan twist. When you pull the veil off, what\u2019s underneath is often far more fascinating and intricate than what meets the eye. For years, theories have run rampant about the behind-the-scenes interactions and collaborations of major power players. With the explosion of alternative media platforms, the dissemination of these theories has gained incredible momentum. Now, as we cross the mid-point of 2023, some of these rumors no longer seem so outrageous. It\u2019s no longer a whisper; it\u2019s a roar. The undeniable resonance comes from none other than influential figures like Valuetainment\u2019s Patrick Bet-David (PBD), whose reach has become a force to reckon with. PBD\u2019s podcast, a juggernaut in the broadcasting world, impacts over 30 million people every month. This isn\u2019t merely a single stream but a massive, rippling effect as his podcast is rebroadcast on thousands of channels, websites, and browsers globally. The Silent Alliance It may seem like a bold claim, but the evidence is mounting. Several key figures are supposedly coming together, moving like a well-oiled machine beneath the surface. Think about it: Trump, with his undeniable charisma and ability to stir the masses; Elon Musk, the genius entrepreneur known for groundbreaking ventures and his audacious comments on societal structures; and Tucker Carlson, the articulate and often controversial host, shedding light on subjects many would rather stay in the dark. The whispers and speculations surrounding this trio are not new. They\u2019ve been suggested in many discreet \u201cDROPS\u201d over the past couple of years, hinting at major internet podcasts being activated for pivotal information dissemination. And while many may have brushed these off as mere conspiracy theories, the recent rise in specific broadcasts begs us to reconsider. WARNING: The Vatican Demanded this Be Kept Under Lock and Key: \u201cThe Divine Prayer \u2013 One Minute Prayer From Biblical Times\u201d \u2013 VIDEO BELOW And if this triumvirate wasn\u2019t intriguing enough, there\u2019s an even more compelling layer. Joe Rogan, known for his brutally honest and no-holds-barred style, has been a significant presence in this unfolding narrative. A couple of years ago, certain \u201cDROPS\u201d suggested Rogan\u2019s apparent disdain for Trump was all for show. It was a ruse. Now, in a climactic twist, Rogan allegedly seeks Trump for a monumental 2023 or 2024 podcast. Why would this be significant? Because Rogan has turned his sights against perceived adversaries. In recent months, he\u2019s taken on vaccine information, challenging notable figures like Gates and organizations such as the WHO, WEF, and even highlighting Soros\u2019s role. He\u2019s gone so far as to expose Biden and validate controversial topics like the Hunter laptop situation and the Russia collusion narrative. Confronting the \u2018Deep State\u2019 The term \u2018Deep State\u2019 has been bandied about for a while, sometimes mocked, often dismissed. But what Rogan, and now potentially this alliance of Trump, Musk, and Carlson, is doing is forcing us to confront its existence. Is there a global machinery working quietly, shaping narratives and controlling outcomes? The more one delves into the tidbits being exposed, the harder it becomes to turn a blind eye. These aren\u2019t just mere ramblings of a select few anymore. The drumbeat is getting louder and impossible to ignore. When the lines between reality and staged narratives blur, an aggressive tone isn\u2019t just preferred \u2013 it\u2019s essential. We are, arguably, in one of the most politically and socially charged eras in recent history. The populace is waking up, and they demand the truth. In this vast media landscape, it\u2019s easy to get lost, to be swept away by mainstream narratives. But as platforms like PBD\u2019s podcast and the likes of Rogan\u2019s show have proven, alternative sources can no longer be dismissed. They\u2019re here, they\u2019re powerful, and they\u2019re pulling back the curtain on many hidden agendas. So, where does this leave us? Armed with keywords like Trump, Musk, Carlson, Rogan, Deep State, and more, a deeper dive into the world of alternative media and its explosive revelations is warranted. The call to action is clear: Stay vigilant, question the mainstream, and most importantly, seek the truth. No matter how dramatic or aggressive it may sound, the age of passive consumption is over. As we head further into 2023 and approach 2024, brace yourself. This drama is just getting started, and if the current trajectory is anything to go by, we\u2019re in for an unforgettable rollercoaster ride. One where truth, power, and intrigue collide in a spectacle that the world has never seen before. America\u2019s Clandestine Operations and Covert Leaders With the world watching, certain figures emerge from the shadows, playing their roles with precise intent. From the public disdain of former President Trump to RFKJR\u2019s revelation about the so-called \u201cplandemic,\u201d the inner workings of secret American operations are slowly, yet resolutely, coming to light. The world of politics isn\u2019t just about ballot boxes, speeches, or election campaigns. Far from the spotlight, hidden operations steer the course of history. This deep dive will unravel the complex and covert narratives, bringing to light the secrets of U.S. military white hats, key players, and their interconnected missions. A Game of Disguise: The Trump Paradox To an average observer, the widespread disdain for Donald Trump seemed organic. But in the clandestine corridors of military psychological operations, this was a calculated move. Why? To cultivate networks. Every time someone voiced their opposition to Trump, another node in the vast web of patriot communities and anonymous fighters against the [DS] was created, bringing together neutral Americans without even their realization. Bobby Kennedy Jr. wasn\u2019t just another Democrat. Commanding 30% of the Democratic Party, RFKJR wielded substantial influence, and he didn\u2019t hesitate to use it. He worked tirelessly to expose what many have termed the \u201cplandemic,\u201d unmasking the elites\u2019 vaccine agendas, biolabs, and their involvement in the Ukraine War. His revelations about giants like BlackRock, Vanguard, and the military complex shocked the very core of the establishment. While some might argue that RFKJR is just an activist, in reality, he\u2019s a chess piece, moving methodically across a grand board. The endgame? Bringing different leaders and their communities together under covert military operations. This amalgamation, once slow and undetectable, is now rapidly coming to a head. The Curious Case of Musk and Desantis Enter Elon Musk, a billionaire known for space rockets and electric cars. Musk\u2019s support for Desantis was not just a casual endorsement. It was a move in a bigger game. The subsequent failure of Musk\u2019s Twitter campaign for Desantis in May was not accidental. Instead, it was a planned failure. Many recall the infamous night when Twitter inexplicably crashed, ensuring Desantis\u2019 political momentum never recovered. Accidental glitch or meticulous strategy? Jim Jordan, RFKJR, and the Fauci Nexus As Representative Jim Jordan tirelessly goes after Dr. Anthony Fauci, intent on exposing the National Institutes of Health, he\u2019s not alone. RFKJR holds cards, strategic and devastating, that can unveil the origins of the current pandemic and the intricate layers of deceit around it. Supreme Power: SCOTUS Under the White Hats\u2019 Control The highest court of the land, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), is believed by many to be the last bastion of justice. However, rumors swirl that behind the scenes, it\u2019s the U.S. white hats military that truly pulls the strings. The Brunson case, mysteriously kept under wraps, may well prove to be the key to exposing a military coup tied to the controversial 2020 election. The 2020 Election Saga and the Trump Indictments Remember the predictions that Donald Trump was on the verge of arrest? It wasn\u2019t mere speculation. The saga of the \u2018stolen\u2019 2020 election, the indictments against Trump, and the U.S. judges \u2013 suspected plants from a bygone era \u2013 gunning for him are all intricately linked. These plants, established to collapse and expose a weaponized, compromised judicial system, are connected with foreign governments and entities such as the World Economic Forum, Davos Group, and the ever-controversial George Soros. The Great Unveiling As the intricate web continues to unravel, one thing is clear: the shadows hold more than just darkness; they hold the strings of power, the puppeteers, and the story yet to be fully told. The stage is set, the actors are in place, and as America watches with bated breath, the grand narrative unfolds, revealing the power plays of the elites and the resilience of those who dare to challenge them. WARNING: Watching The Following Video Will Give You Access To Knowledge The Government Does NOT Want You To Know About The Hidden Military Messages in Trump\u2019s Controversial Mugshot: An Investigation into Global Power Plays In a world dominated by mainstream narratives and where photos drive public opinion, the Trump \u2018mugshot\u2019 emerges not as a simple image but as a beacon of clandestine military communications. Dive deep as we expose the underbelly of international power dynamics, unveiling truth buried in a wave of misinformation. 1. Trump\u2019s Mugshot: Not Just A Photo, But A Message Images tell a thousand words, and in today\u2019s digital age, they spread even faster. Recently, a \u2018mugshot\u2019 of former President Donald Trump went viral, but for those in the know, this wasn\u2019t a mere photo\u2014it was a message, a communication; it was military comms. But why does this photograph ring alarm bells? Simple. When arrested, protocol demands that an individual look forward with their head up for three distinct shots. No chin-down pose. No deviations. So, this very obvious photoshop work, which could never have been released by a Police department, begs the question: Why is it here? What message does it carry? 2. Understanding Military Comms: The Language of The Shadows To the untrained eye, this photograph may seem like a poorly fabricated image meant to slander or perhaps mock the former president. However, discerning eyes know better. This is military comms from Trump, signaling the world that what they\u2019re witnessing is all staged\u2014a grand show for global audiences. Such clandestine communication is sent out for three fundamental reasons: To Let Important Anons Know: The \u2018in-the-know\u2019 community, the \u201cAnons,\u201d immediately recognize the theatrics. This photo serves as a flag, a call to arms, a message that says, \u2018it\u2019s staged.\u2019 A Warning to the Deep State: It\u2019s no secret that organizations like the CIA, DS, and the military sector within the Pentagon have their eyes and ears everywhere. This image stands as a stark reminder\u2014military operations are drawing near, closer than they might think. Russian and Italian Operations: A few years ago, the grapevine was abuzz with whispers. Wires from military sectors in Italy and Russia were buzzing with information about a forthcoming public event concerning Trump\u2014an arrest, a scandal, something big. And when this event, like the released mugshot, would go public, it would be the trigger, setting off Italian and Russian operations that would lead to the declassification and release of essential public information. The Alliance Military Operations, it seems, would kick into high gear, revealing the secrets of the deep state to the world. 3. The Visible Pawns: Kash Patel and Jan Hayes Both Kash Patel (former Chief of Staff to the acting United States Secretary of Defence) and Jan Hayes (from the Department of Defense) have made appearances on Q supported channels. This visibility isn\u2019t casual\u2014it\u2019s a declaration. They\u2019re letting the world know that the military is gearing up to expose certain truths. Topmost on this list? The controversies surrounding the 2020 elections. 4. Behind The Scenes Power Moves While the world remains embroiled in media-fed narratives, significant moves are happening behind the curtain. Pelosi has been removed, and other influential deep state actors are on the chopping block. And then there\u2019s the curious case of Kamala Harris. Who placed her in the position of Vice President? Was it a mere political move, or was it a masterstroke to ensure that she\u2019d never occupy the president\u2019s office if something were to befall Biden? 5. Trump\u2019s Power Handover: The Deep State\u2019s Worst Nightmare Since 2017, the narrative has been consistent. Trump, it seems, handed over significant power to the military. It\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. The military, though supportive of Trump, required his signature to initiate operations meant to purge the deep state. And it gets deeper. In 2018, Trump\u2019s Executive Orders empowered the U.S. Military to not only carry out covert operations but also maintain the continuity of government operations. All fingers point towards personalities like Ezra Cohen-Watnick and the team at Cheyenne mountain. This group is rumored to have created the \u2018Devolution Plan\u2019, a blueprint for global power shifts. 6. The World\u2019s Patriots: The Last Line of Defence To the world\u2019s patriots, this isn\u2019t mere politics\u2014it\u2019s a battle, the final war to end all wars. They stand resolute, watching, waiting, and preparing. Conclusion: In an era where truth is the first casualty, images like Trump\u2019s \u2018mugshot\u2019 are more than they appear. They\u2019re symbols, messages, and warnings. It\u2019s time the world read between the pixels. The White Hats Plan 3: A Symphony of Strategy \u2013 A Tribute to JFK \u2013 Where We Go One We Go All! (Must See Video) In the clandestine realm of conspiracy theories and hidden agendas, a cryptic message echoes through the corridors of time: \u201cTHE WHITE HATS THERE IS A PLAN 3.\u201d As you delve into this enigma, brace yourself for a journey that uncovers the shadows of power, pays homage to a fallen leader, and exposes a battle between light and darkness.

It claims that these technologies will help keep Singaporean society safe and secure. Civil society organisations (CSOs), however, raised concerns[i] over the rights to privacy and the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) administration advancing to become a digital authoritarian regime. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore government strongly pushed forward its use of surveillance technology. The government promoted tracking applications and other monitoring tools as a main solution to the health crisis. This article argues that the government used COVID-19 to legitimise the extension of surveillance infrastructure. Using health risk concerns, the government was able to, without facing any resistance, get its citizens under the ambit of digital authoritarianism. Given the widespread self-censorship in the city-state, Singapore citizens and residents predictably restrained[ii] themselves from voicing any critical opinions of the government\u2019s move to place the country and its population under tighter surveillance. The Consolidation of State Surveillance Digital authoritarianism is a form of political rule under which governments use digital and cyber tools to control and manipulate information flows. Through such tools, governments can keep a close eye[iii] on those who challenge their preponderance. This empowers them to tighten their political grip on power at the expense of civilians\u2019 rights to privacy. Even before the pandemic, Singapore was moving ahead towards being a surveillance state, devoting a significant amount of its resources to improving its monitoring capability. As of May 2023, there were a little over 109,000 CCTV cameras[iv] in the city-state or 17.94 cameras per 1,000 people. Additionally, the government plans to add another 90,000 cameras, for a total of 180,000 cameras[v] by 2030. The island also has at least 20,000 public Wireless@SG hotspots[vi]. Wireless@SG is operated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which are majority-owned by the government. These ISPs have been reported to give away personal information[vii] of their users to the government.[viii] Wireless@SG can thus provide a platform for the government to collect data on Singaporeans\u2019 internet usage and activities. Apart from these tools, which provide lawful mechanisms for obtaining information and data from people living in the country, the Singapore government has acquired and used state-of-the-art spyware against critics of the PAP administration. The country\u2019s law enforcement agencies have \u201cextensive networks for gathering information and conducting surveillance and highly sophisticated capabilities to monitor [\u2026] digital communications intended to remain private\u201d[ix]. These capacities were utilised against government critics and political activists[x], as revealed by reports and leaked documents. For example, in 2021, the government reportedly attempted to use spyware to hack into[xi] the Facebook accounts of two Singaporean journalists[xii] whose pieces are often critical of the government. The use of surveillance tools, whether their use is legal or not, is enabled or facilitated through legal provisions and loopholes. At the government\u2019s disposal are the Cybersecurity Act, Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, and the Infectious Disease Act. They contain vague and subjective definitions of key terms. To name one example, the High Court, in the case Chee Siok Chin and Others v Minister for Home Affairs and Another, laid out the context of \u201cpublic order\u201d in which rights may be restricted. The High Court\u2019s interpretation, however, is built upon what is considered the \u2018interest\u2019 of public interest and not the maintenance of public order. This gives room[xiii] for the government to implement intrusive measures against individuals even though such measures may not contribute to the maintenance of public order. Furthermore, the lack of privacy laws must also be noted. Section 23 of the Cybersecurity Act (2018), gives extensive powers to the Commissioners should there be a cybersecurity emergency, \u201cfor the purpose of preventing, detecting or countering any serious and imminent threat to essential services or the \u2018national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore\u201d. Apart from enabling those in charge to enact measures provided in other Sections, authorities can order information relating to the design, configuration or operation of any computer and undertake information-gathering operations. This may include mass real-time information collection to identify, detect, or counter any such threat. While the law protects any access to information subject to legal privilege, it has effect \u201cdespite any restriction on the disclosure of information imposed by law, contract or rules of professional conduct\u201d. The Singapore government rolled out the TraceTogether app for its contact tracing initiative. Screenshot from GovSG video. Online State Surveillance Throughout the course of the pandemic, surveillance technology played a crucial role in Singapore\u2019s COVID-19 measures. The government concentrated on subduing the infection rate to the bare minimum by restricting and controlling people\u2019s movement. This was made possible by tracking applications. SafeEntry and TraceTogether later merged into one under TraceTogether.[xiv] The use of this application was enforced to track people\u2019s movement to identify cluster-prone areas and detect if people were in close proximity to those infected. TraceTogether was presented by the government as a technology-driven solution, reflecting the grand strategy to adopt digital solutions to aid and assist Singapore\u2019s version of governance. At the beginning of the pandemic, the use of tracking applications raised questions from the public,[xv] who were particularly concerned by the infringement of their privacy. Many people feared that the applications would give away their geo-location and movement, enabling the government to assess their habits and activities. Some were concerned that the government might eavesdrop on phone conversations through these apps. There were fears of the applications being the government\u2019s Trojan[xvi] for spyware to be embedded in their devices. Such concerns were not groundless, given Singapore\u2019s history of state surveillance combined with vague and excessive cyber laws and legal loopholes. However, the government was quick to dismiss such concerns, arguing that TraceTogether operates on Bluetooth technology and uses a \u201cdigital handshake\u201d to collect data only when a device comes into proximity with other devices. It does not use GPS technology, which can pinpoint the real-world location of devices, nor does it collect real-time movements (Ibid.). Government health experts also came out to claim[xvii] that enforcing tracking devices is a common COVID-19 measure in Asia and that TraceTogether was less intrusive compared to tracking applications used in democratic Taiwan and Korea. Simply put, the Singapore government argued that the application does not surveil people because it lacks the capacity to do so. Such explanations are problematic because they are built on the assumption that[xviii] Bluetooth technology is privacy-friendly. This has been proven wrong[xix] as one study showed that TraceTogether can identify and locate its user. The Bluetooth technology itself, while less intrusive, offers little to block the government[xx] from accessing data or hacking the handset. By downplaying the intrusiveness of the application, the government was able to set a new standard of what was publicly accepted when it comes to surveillance. Moreover, it omitted from the public discussion concerns regarding legal loopholes and overbroad laws that legalise mass surveillance in the first place. The government did not clarify how Singapore\u2019s laws will apply to data from the application, nor did it issue legal provisions that would govern the use of the application. However, the government affirmed that the data from the application would be used solely for health purposes. Later when it came to light that the police accessed TraceTogether\u2019s database for a case, the government revoked its own word[xxi] by arguing that the Singapore Police Force, empowered by the Criminal Procedure Code, can access TraceTogether\u2019s database for criminal investigations. Singaporeans use the TraceTogether app to comply with government COVID-19 regulations. Screenshot from GovSG video. Normalisation of Surveillance as Part of Life The Singaporean government used the rhetoric of the common good to compromise on rights to privacy. On different occasions, it cited health and safety as reasons for enforcing the tracking application. The argument goes that it is a duty of good civilians to sacrifice some of their rights for the collective good of their fellow nationals. The government even used healthcare workers to support this claim, saying that the application will lighten the burden of healthcare workers[xxii] who risk their lives for others. To be sure, this rhetoric is nothing new to Singaporeans. It is the same kind of excuse[xxiii] that the government has been using to install CCTV cameras with facial recognition on street corners. However, it is during the pandemic that Singapore saw more of its population endorsing state surveillance. As the pandemic prolonged, surveys show that Singaporeans became more in favour of TraceTogether as a solution to the health crisis. In a survey[xxiv] conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) in 2020, 49.2% of respondents strongly agreed with the government\u2019s proposed methods of using cellphone data to track people\u2019s movement without their consent during the COVID-19 lockdown. Another survey in 2021[xxv] shows that more Singaporeans agreed that TraceTogether should be made obligatory. Singaporeans surveyed in 2022[xxvi] have facilitated the use of TraceTogether among themselves. This inclination is particularly prevalent in a 2022 report[xxvii], in which respondents expressed that they will continue using TraceTogether despite the infection rate subsiding. This proves that many Singaporeans have been successfully led to believe in the government\u2019s use of security as a justification for extensive surveillance. The enforcement of TraceTogether normalised the state of being under surveillance[xxvii] and made it an acceptable part of life in Singapore. The government took advantage of Singaporeans\u2019 indifference and trust and expanded its physical and online surveillance networks, both legal and illicit. It was during the pandemic that the government abruptly increased the budget[xxix] for information and communications technology to $3.5 billion, with part of the budget intended to enhance the country\u2019s surveillance infrastructure, arguing that this will get the nation through the crisis and emerge stronger. In February 2022, it came to light that the Singaporean government purchased spyware from QuaDream, an Israeli developer.[xxx] Soon after that, also in February 2022, the chairperson of the opposition Workers\u2019 Party claimed in parliament that she had received a notification from Apple that the government attempted to install spyware[xxxi] into her cellphone. The Minister contended that the phone was not infected and challenged the chairperson to send the phone to the police for forensic examination. The chairperson chose not to take the matter further, stating that the Minister\u2019s response was satisfactory. These examples show that privacy is of concern as surveillance technologies are rolled out in Singapore, and the government insists it is not abusing surveillance tools. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the Singapore government has continually used this momentum and the public\u2019s acceptance to expand their surveillance. Facial recognition has recently been introduced in public services, including the use of SingPass \u2013 an application all citizens and residents can use to access government services. The SingPass application now incorporates facial recognition technologies, which, according to the official reasoning, will facilitate easier access to both government and private services. Also under the Singpass initiative, the government is trialling biometric authentication[xxxii] at hospital entrances. CCTVs with facial recognition technologies[xxxiii] have also been installed in prisons to check headcounts and detect inmates\u2019 activities. Overall, surveillance has reinforced a culture of self-censorship and fear in Singapore which further mutes public criticism of the government. Citizens and residents of Singapore who live under intensive surveillance are becoming more subconsciously fearful of speaking up and being more mindful of their actions both on and offline (Asia Centre, 2023). In February 2023 the pandemic was declared over[xxxiv] in Singapore and the government allowed citizens to uninstall TraceTogether, return Bluetooth tokens and move about freely. Nevertheless, Singaporeans continue to be unwilling to express themselves freely and many restrain themselves from formulating critical thoughts even when they are by themselves. Constant surveillance in Singapore also creates unease among its residents. People may fear[xxxv] that any wrong actions or choice of words could be reported back to the government. Such unease can be further exacerbated by lateral surveillance \u2013 a form of surveillance conducted by individual members of society. With the government successfully constructing acquiescence to state surveillance as a duty, Singapore residents may further internalise this new convention and believe that reporting to the government of \u201cunsavoury social behaviour\u201d is a characteristic of a good citizen or resident. Conclusion The pandemic normalised digital authoritarianism in Singapore. Under the pretence of COVID-19 measures, the government rolled out a tracking application that, together with the existing legal tools, intruded into the private life of people in Singapore. There were some concerns and pushback from the public at first. But as the pandemic lingered, Singaporeans have become more and more accepting of the fact that being watched by the government via their electronic devices and other forms of surveillance was in their best interest. Such acceptance was brought about by the government\u2019s use of the rhetoric of the common good, which forces Singaporeans and residents of Singapore to voluntarily give up their rights to privacy as a form of patriotism. As a result, the pandemic shaped the city-state\u2019s\u2019 favourable attitude and mindset towards state surveillance. * Note to readers: Please click the share button above.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.blacklistednews.com\/article\/85641\/unmasking-farmington-ftx-fluent-finance-and-the-coming-digital.html",
        "text":"One of the oddest and most mysterious relationships that emerged out of the collapse of FTX last year was Alameda Research\u2019s unusual relationship with Farmington State Bank, one of the smallest, rural banks in the United States that came under the control of Jean Chalopin in 2020. Chalopin is best known as the chairman of Deltec, one of the main banks for Alameda Research \u2013 FTX\u2019s trading arm that played a central role in its collapse \u2014 and still one of the main banks for the largest fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT). Chalopin had acquired control over Farmington via FBH Corp., where Chalopin was listed as executive officer. Interestingly, Noah Perlman, a former DOJ and DEA official who is now Chief Compliance Officer at Binance and the son of Jeffrey Epstein associate and musician Itzhak Perlman, was also listed as a director of FBH Corp and has never publicly explained his connection with this Chalopin-controlled entity. As Unlimited Hangout reported last December, soon after its acquisition by Chalopin\u2019s FBH Corp., Farmington \u201cpivoted to deal with cryptocurrency and international payments\u201d after decades upon decades of serving as a single branch community bank in rural Washington. Soon after its pivot into the crypto space, Farmington struggled to move money and sought approval to become part of the Federal Reserve system. It also changed its name from Farmington State Bank to Moonstone Bank. The approval of Farmington by the Federal Reserve has been deemed highly unusual and as having \u201cglossed over Moonstone\u2019s for-profit foreign interests.\u201d Late last December, Eric Kollig, spokesman for the Federal Reserve, told reporters that he could not comment \u201cabout the process that federal regulators undertook to approve Chalopin\u2019s purchase of the charter of Farmington State Bank in 2020.\u201d Just days after Farmington formally changed its name to Moonstone in early March 2022, FTX-affiliated Alameda Research poured $11.5 million into the bank, which was \u2013 at the time \u2013 more than twice its entire net worth. Moonstone\u2019s Chief Digital Officer, Jean Chalopin\u2019s son Janvier, later stated that the funding from Alameda Research had been \u201cseed funding \u2026 to execute our new plan of being a tech-focused bank.\u201d Farmington State Bank as it appears on Google Maps, Source: Protos Upon Alameda\u2019s taking a stake in the bank, Jean Chalopin stated that this move \u201csignifies the recognition, by one of the world\u2019s most innovative financial leaders, of the value of what we are aiming to achieve. This marks a new step into building the future of banking.\u201d Outlets like Protos have noted how unusual it is that a Bahamas-based company like FTX was \u201cable to purchase a stake in a federally approved bank\u201d without attracting the attention of regulators.Washington State regulators have stated that they were \u201caware\u201d of Alameda\u2019s investment in Farmington\/Moonstone and defended their decision not to intervene or take further regulatory action. Notably, the influx of new money into the remodeled Farmington was not exclusive to FTX\/Alameda. A New York Times article on the matter noted that Farmington\/Moonstone\u2019s deposits \u2013 which had hovered around $10 million for many decades \u2013 quickly surged to $84 million, with $71 million coming from only four new accounts during this same relatively short period in 2022. As Unlimited Hangout previously noted, the same day the Alameda investment was announced, Moonstone installed Ronald Oliveira as CEO. Oliviera had previously worked for the fintech company Revolut, a \u201cleading digital alternative bank\u201d financed by Jeffrey Epstein associate Nicole Junkermann. Roughly two months later, the bank hired Joseph Vincent as its legal counsel. Immediately prior to joining Farmington\/Moonstone, Vincent had served as the general counsel for Washington State\u2019s Department of Financial Institutions and its director of legal and regulatory affairs for 18 years. Shortly before FTX\u2019s collapse, which put Farmington\/Moonstone under heavy scrutiny, Farmington\/Moonstone partnered with a relatively unknown company called Fluent Finance. Fluent Finance, both then and now, has evaded scrutiny from the media aside from Unlimited Hangout\u2019s investigation into Farmington, published last December. However, since FTX\u2019s unraveling and the shuttering of Farmington\/Moonstone in the months that followed, Fluent Finance has been quite busy, developing significant government partnerships in the Middle East and looking to become a central part of the coming Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) paradigm for both West and East. FTX and the Curious History of Farmington State Bank Since FTX\u2019s collapse, a tiny bank in rural Washington has come under heavy scrutiny for the role it may have played in the crypto exchange\u2019s fraudulent activities. Ed Berger and Whitney Webb investigate the history of the bank and unearth some troubling connections. A likely reason behind the lack of media interest in Fluent Finance and their apparent success after the FTX scandal is the fact that Fluent, from its earliest days, has been operating as an apparent front for some of the most powerful commercial banks in the world and building out \u201ctrusted\u201d digital infrastructure for the economy to come. This investigation, an examination of Fluent\u2019s past and its current trajectory, may help elucidate the true motives behind the efforts of Chalopin, Bankman-Fried and others to turn the tiny Farmington State Bank into \u201cMoonstone.\u201d Fluent Finance\u2019s Deep and Early Connections to Wall Street Banks Fluent Finance was created in 2020 and was co-founded by Bradley Allgood, Oliver Gale and Jaime Plata. Allgood began his career with the US Army and later went on to serve in NATO\u2019s Governmental Operations division with an apparent focus on NATO activity in Afghanistan. After leaving NATO, Allgood \u201cimmediately jumped\u201d into economic development, specifically the creation and expansion of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), specifically one partnered with the Catawba Indian Reservation in South Carolina. That SEZ, officially named the Catawba Digital Economic Zone, was co-founded by Allgood in 2019 and he still serves as its head of Commercial Banking. Logo of the Catawba Digital Economic Zone, Source: South Carolina Business Journal Sitting on just two acres of land, the zone aims to \u201cbecome the worldwide registration hub for crypto companies\u201d as well as to \u201ctake a huge chunk out of Delaware\u2019s market for company registration or even to replace it as the gold standard.\u201d The zone is backed by a venture capital firm tied to Bradley Tusk, the former Deputy Governor of Illinois under disgraced former Governor Rod Blagojevich and the former campaign manager for billionaire Mike Bloomberg. In addition, Tusk\u2019s companies count Google, the Rockefeller Foundation and Ripple (XRP) among their clients. Tusk\u2019s different VC firms have invested in Coinbase and Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, and Uber as well as the economic zone co-founded by Allgood. Shortly after leaving the military, Allgood also worked on the early development of digital transformation of governments, digital identities, people and property registries and the tokenization of carbon credits and commodities. Later motivated by \u201cthe sheer number of unbanked and underbanked in the world\u201d, Allgood hosted roundtables around the world with central bank \u201cregulators, tier one institutions, innovators, [and] technology providers\u201d and decided he could act as \u201ca good connector\u201d for the different actors in his growing network. Allgood claims to have spoken to a few \u201creally senior\u201d banking executives at HSBC, Citi and Barclays and to have educated \u201cthem on new innovative technologies for custody [and] better digital identity.\u201d After \u201cbuilding a team\u201d of these \u201csenior bankers from tier one financial institutions,\u201d Allgood and his team \u201cwent out into the market and started servicing the [cryptocurrency] space and helping innovative companied find homes and large core banking systems and tier one financial institutions.\u201d While working with these various titans of finance and guiding their views on the future of banking, Allgood met his co-founders of Fluent Finance: Oliver Gale and Jaime Plata. The founders of Fluent Finance, Source: Fluent Finance Oliver Gale is one of the co-founders of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), having pioneered the first CBDC project in the Eastern Caribbean and, per Allgood, Gale \u201cwent on to do them in Nigeria\u201d and helped create the highly controversial e-Naira. Gale notably describes himself as the inventor of CBDCs and has previously collaborated with the UN, MIT and the IMF. Jaime Plata, Fluent\u2019s other co-founder, \u201cdid the core banking systems of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank during the first CBDC [launch].\u201d Aside from Gale and Plata, Allgood has revealed that other top Fluent Finance executives, who are not listed on the company\u2019s website, hail from the Wall Street titan Citi \u2013 with the company\u2019s CFO being \u201cthe CFO of Citi of all of Latin America\u201d and its COO being \u201cone of the senior, most senior, managing directors from Citi.\u201d He has also stated that other important employees of Fluent include the former chief innovation officer of General Electric as well as \u201can early board member at [the now collapsed crypto exchange] Celsius [that] helped them get to market.\u201d Fluent Finance was initially founded with two main and interrelated products: the Fluent Protocol and the US+ stablecoin. Fluent has described the Fluent Protocol as \u201ca financial network that seamlessly bridges traditional finance and digital assets,\u201d while US+ is a \u201cbank-led\u201d, US dollar-pegged stablecoin \u201cbuilt on principles\u201d and designed to be \u201cforward-compatible with CBDC initiatives.\u201d Fluent asserts that US+ resolves \u201cthe inherent flaws of web3-native stablecoins\u201d by having US+ be operated by a network of banks partnered with Fluent Finance. Fluent has not made the identities of these banks available to the public. \u201cWhen we examined stablecoins, we knew that the lack of institutional uptake of the technology was due to risk,\u201d explained Allgood. \u201cWith that in mind, when we approached the design of US+, we did so in terms of de-risking. We knew we needed to provide real-time and transparent reserves monitoring.\u201d Fluent\u2019s answer to providing the reserve metrics needed to tap into the heavily regulated traditional finance market emerged through its partnership with Chainlink, first announced in September 2022. Chainlink is a blockchain oracle network, meaning it connects blockchains to external systems. It was launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and later registered in the Cayman Islands as SmartContract Chainlink Limited SEZC in March 2019. In December 2021, the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who has unprecedented control over the Biden administration\u2019s technology policies, joined Chainlink Labs as a strategic advisor. At the time, Schmidt commented that \u201cit has become clear that one of blockchain\u2019s greatest advantages \u2014 a lack of connection to the world outside itself \u2014 is also its biggest challenge.\u201d Fluent\u2019s partnership with Chainlink dealt with regulatory necessities by providing a reliable way for the Fluent Protocol to access real-time, off-chain data from external sources. Fluent\u2019s goal was\/is to provide proof of the size, performance, and risk of its asset reserves in order to meet its stablecoin protocol liquidity requirements. Reliable confirmation and publishing of the state of these reserves was seen as crucial by Allgood and others at Fluent in order to manufacture trust from both retail users and membership banks. Fluent is far from the only partner of Chainlink working on providing trusted stablecoin reserve architecture. Among them is Paxos, the former issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD and their own PAX, and who recently began providing infrastructure for PayPal\u2019s PYUSD stablecoin. Paxos relied on Chainlink to provide on-chain Proof of Reserve Data Feeds for Paxos\u2019 assets, ensuring verification that PAX tokens are 1:1 backed by US Dollars. This was taken a step further with their gold-backed PAXG tokens, in which Chainlink claimed to be able to provide verification of off-chain, physical gold bars held in Paxos\u2019 custody. Another Chainlink partner is the XinFin Network, also known as the XDC network, which uses Chainlink\u2019s Price Reference Data framework to introduce price feeds for major national currencies such as the Hong Kong Dollar, the Singaporean Dollar, and the United Arab Emirates Dirham. In October 2022, Fluent Finance announced a partnership with Impel to bring its US+ stablecoin to the XDC network. Impel itself is a startup birthed out of XinFin Fintech led by CEO and founder Troy S. Wood. The company boasts a team of advisors including XDC Network co-founders Ritesh Kakkad and Atul Khekade, in addition to long time SWIFT employee Andr\u00e9 Casterman. Source: Fluent Finance In March 2021, XinFin leveraged the DASL Crypto Bridge designed by LAB577 to bring their XDC token to R3\u2019s Corda blockchain. R3 began as a consortium of banks and is not only closely connected to Fluent Finance, but, as will be discussed shortly, is also a major driver of CBDC and stablecoin development globally. Before this XDC-Corda bridge was created, there was no liquidity or token of value on the R3 Corda Network. This bridge opened up the opportunity for traditional financial institutions, such as those that fund R3, to interact with cryptocurrency indirectly without having to operate on under-regulated public networks that could land them in hot water with regulators. It also gives access to those already utilizing Ethereum-based tokens (i.e. ERC20 or ERC721) to the business networks and financial institutions on the Corda network. XDC co-founder and Impel advisor Atul Khekade remarked that the both government regulators and commercial banks had settled on XDC and Corda as the means through which many major banks would access blockchain technologies:",

The child was part of a group of over a hundred schoolchildren, all of whom were subsequently taken to the hospital for health assessments. Some 125 children, reportedly from Russia's Lugansk People's Republic, were returning from a health camp in Tyumen, Siberia, chaperoned by adults. On Wednesday evening, the health of one of the girls dramatically deteriorated, authorities said. At first, she had a temperature of 39\u00b0 Celsius (over 102\u00b0 Fahrenheit), which was brought down with fever-reducing medicines.

        "text":"There are two different worlds of fear right now: those who fear the virus and those who fear the future control of mankind being propelled under the guise of the virus. Through this, they have created a division \u2013 those who want others to fear the virus as much as them and become recluses, and those who want those who fear the virus to wake up from the spell they have been put under so they can stand and fight against their freedoms being stripped away by the day. Sometimes, when you are in the thick of it, it\u2019s hard to discern what is truth. Keeping everyone in a perpetual state of fear is how they divide and conquer \u2013 but it goes much deeper and is far more sinister than that. Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world. \u2013 Ralph Waldo Emerson Part 5 is the most important part of this extensive report, and includes information and data that may stun you, and may very well confirm what you have suspected, or provide the missing pieces you needed to see with clarity. It encompasses the following sections: \u2022 Some Basic Facts About the Virus \u2022 Capitalizing on Fear \u2022 Psychologists Explain How Fear Plays A Big Role in Epidemics and Pandemics \u2022 Biology of Fear\u2019s Effect on The Brain and Health \u2022 Fear Cancels the Placebo Effect: Why This Matters \u2022 CIA Documents on Brainwashing and \u201cLearned Helplessness\u201d \u2022 Expert in Deception, Psychological Operations & National Security Speaks to Cadets at West Point \u2022 The Road Ahead We judge risk by our feelings more than looking at data and statistics and evidence \u2013 Paul Slovic, PhD Over 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety disorders, and 4% of the world\u2019s population suffer from it, making anxiety and depression the most common mental health disorder in the world. The extreme messaging and misinformation carried out by the media, philanthropists, and politicians regarding Covid-19, hit every hot button to trigger the masses. Part one of this 5-part report went over hospitalization data, showing that the 2017-2018 flu season had 810,000 hospitalizations, far exceeding Covid. For years the media has exclaimed that \u201chospitals are at capacity,\u201d but no one paid much attention until now. Part two broke down the CDC\u2019s data on how they have been combining pneumonia, influenza, and covid deaths as \u201cPIC\u201d to paint a larger number of Covid deaths. Part three covered the nursing homes which make up 38% of the reported Covid deaths. Part four explained how Dr. Deborah Birx and state health officials have stated that they are counting anyone who tests positive for Covid as a Covid death even though they have died from another cause. It also explained the PCR tests, how 90% of Covid-positives are asymptomatic with only a 0.7% household spread rate. Think about it. If you change the past, you change human behavior. To change human motivation, we don\u2019t have to persuade people, you can just change their memory. \u2013 Dr. Charles Morgan, Psychological and National Security Expert Some Basic Facts About This Virus It\u2019s easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled. \u2013 Mark Twain \u2022 Legacy news immediately brought on Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, and former CDC Director Thomas Frieden to tell everyone that models show 1-2 million people will die in the U.S., and they need a lot of money to prepare for this, only later to admit the models were wrong. \u2022 On January 3, 2021, the CDC released its year-end final week count of all-cause deaths, adding a staggering 269,259. This is unheard of for one week, or even two weeks, and it reveals how the CDC has been shifting other causes of death into the Covid category, as Corey\u2019s Digs previously reported on. \u2022 No country has ever received a specimen of the actual virus to isolate and purify, and China allegedly destroyed it. They only received a genome sequence that was uploaded to the internet, from China. \u2022 After a year of scientists, doctors, lab workers, Corey\u2019s Digs, and other alternative news sources reporting that PCR tests are producing false positive results, and even Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a cycle threshold over 36 will result in false positive tests, the World Health Organization came out on the day of Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration to validate this, resulting in a sweeping decline in cases. \u2022 Despite Bill Gates, Dr. Fauci, the CDC, WHO, and countless others consistently reassuring the public that everything will get back to normal once we have a vaccine, they are now claiming it\u2019s not in fact a \u201cvaccine,\u201d will not prevent someone from getting Covid, will merely treat the symptoms, and therefore everyone needs to remain social distancing and wearing masks. \u2022 People observed viral videos of individuals in China allegedly dropping to their death in the streets, and within weeks, nearly the entire globe was allegedly taken over by this virus, yet no one dropped dead in the streets in any other country. Fear porn? \u2022 They originally claimed it hit the U.S. in January, then later claimed it could have been here as early as November. Some believe it\u2019s been here for years. \u2022 Ground zero was at a nursing home in Washington State, just 5 minutes from Bill Gates home. The new \u201cground zero\u201d became New York City, where Governor Cuomo made it a point to show video of men allegedly digging up graves on an island to bury all of the bodies, in a terrifying display. He also made it a point to show freezer trucks next to hospitals. Despite the elderly being the most prone to any virus, Cuomo later sent thousands of Covid patients to nursing homes while locking down the entire state. An investigation revealed that Cuomo\u2019s staff produced numbers at 50% less than the actual nursing home deaths. Capitalizing on Fear Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth. \u2013 Albert Einstein \u2022 Over 970 million people worldwide have a mental or substance use disorder. The largest number of people have an anxiety disorder, accounting for 4% of the population, making anxiety and depression the most common mental health disorder in the world. \u2022 Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment. \u2022 Anxiety disorders create symptoms that include panic and fear, increased heart rate, rapid breathing, difficulty sleeping, nausea, and dizziness, all of which mimic and can exacerbate Covid symptoms. \u2022 PTSD affects approximately 3.5% of U.S. adults every year, and an estimated one in 11 people will be diagnosed with PTSD in their lifetime. \u2022 A 2019 survey shows that in the U.S., adults were most anxious about keeping themselves and their families safe, being able to pay bills, and their health. \u2022 For those who do not suffer anxiety disorders, excessive worrying alone can cause the following health issues: dizziness, fast heartbeat, headaches, muscle aches, nausea, rapid breathing, shortness of breath, suppression of the immune system, premature coronary artery disease, heart attack, and more. \u2022 The White House task force on Covid-19 informed the American people to stay home if they had symptoms, until it was severe enough to go to a hospital, at which point they were putting people on ventilators rather than treating them with medications proven to work in early stages. Dr. Anthony Fauci was aware of this back in 2005, as Director of NIAID. There are over 40 million Americans suffering from anxiety and phobias. Imagine how easy it was to trigger them with misinformation, propaganda visuals, and fear tactics? When you see people allegedly drop dead in the streets, graves being dug up, freezer trucks parked next to hospitals with alleged dead bodies in them, the media telling you 1-2 million Americans will die, toilet paper and groceries flying off the shelves, and how everyone must lock down, close up their business, mask up, and sterilize everything, that tends to trigger people, even those without anxiety disorders. Fear is a powerful force. If a person becomes overridden with fear, they become incapable of thinking logically and analyzing information and only react from emotion. As time goes on, the majority of their time is spent in preparation, obsessive worrying, listening to the media to tell them what next steps to take, and common sense never truly kicks in because their brain chemistry is no longer serving them. They have been behaviorally conditioned. The hyperbole was powerful, and it took hold in millions of people. A study on \u201cdeath anxiety in the time of COVID-19\u201d published in June 2020, reveals that fear of death drives much of human behavior, is likely at the core of numerous mental illness disorders, and reminders of death exacerbate these illnesses causing social withdrawal, depression, and worse. Throughout this study, it points to several other studies. \u201cOne study investigated the effect of mortality salience on compulsive handwashing, utilizing a large sample of treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with OCD. Participants were first primed with either death or a control topic. Following a short delay to allow the effects of the prime to become unconscious, they were asked to wash their hands. The findings revealed that reminders of death doubled the time spent handwashing.\u201d Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Athony Fauci\u2019s voices will forever ring through the ears of Americans, with a resounding \u201cwash your hands\u201d as they give a nod to reverse psychology. Psychologists Explain How Fear Plays A Big Role in Epidemics and Pandemics We judge risk by our feelings more than by looking at data and statistics and evidence. \u2013 Paul Slovic, PhD For over four decades, Paul Slovic, PhD, professor at the University of Oregon and president of Decision Research, a nonprofit whose scientists study human judgment and decision making, has been working with other psychologists to study what causes people to overreact to epidemics while being less attentive to threats that are far more likely to harm them, such as the flu. Research has shown that threats such as Ebola or avian flu raised anxiety levels higher than more familiar threats. Despite only 10 people in the US contracting Ebola in 2014, it created a mass panic across the country due to excessive media reports effects on those with mental health issues. Whereas most people are not afraid of the flu because they\u2019ve contracted it and survived, even though thousands die from the flu every year. But it\u2019s not just the \u201cunknown\u201d that creates more fear, it\u2019s those delivering the message. Hyperbolic media coverage can exacerbate the situation. \u201cAmerican media have the propensity to find \u2014 and publicize \u2014 aberrant behavior, helping to perpetuate a myth that people tend to respond to a crisis with panic. Disaster researchers know that brave behavior is the norm.\u201d Carnegie Mellon University psychologist Baruch Fischhoff, PhD stated. He chaired the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Risk Advisory Committee and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Homeland Security Advisory Committee. When studying people\u2019s willingness to get vaccinated after the scandalous 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, they found that perception of personal risk was the most influential factor, followed by social pressure and past behavior. \u201cAs psychological research has shown for decades, our sense of risk is driven by our emotions,\u201d says Slovic. \u201cWe judge risk by our feelings more than by looking at data and statistics and evidence.\u201d According to a 2020 study published in the Lancet, quarantine and isolation produce negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Fear\u2019s Effect on The Brain and Health You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, \u2018I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.\u2019 You must do the thing you think you cannot do. \u2013 Eleanor Roosevelt \u201cFear is a feeling that is internal and is conscience,\u201d stated Mary D. Moller, PhD, DNP, ARNP, PMHCNS-BC, CPRP, FAAN, associate professor, Pacific Lutheran University School of Nursing, and director of Psychiatric Services, Northwest Center for Integrated Health, during a presentation in 2017. She explained the consequences of chronic fear on physical, emotional, environmental, and spiritual health, that ultimately attacks ones\u2019 immune system, endocrine system, autonomic nervous system, and can alter the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to emotional despair and phobias. Moller described how fear affects the ability to learn, stating that \u201cthe brain\u2019s capacity to retrieve previous learning is dependent on specific chemical states. Chemical alterations can distort perception of sensory information thus distorting storage.\u201d Not only does it affect the ability to learn, the impact of prolonged stress in \u201cbrain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex respond to acute and chronic stress by undergoing structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses.\u201d Fear learning and fear conditioning trigger all senses, including sense of smell, sound, visuals, tones, words, etc. Repetition of traumatic events and terror, visual images, threats of death, ones\u2019 business burning to the ground, violence in the streets, and all hyperbole witnessed in 2020 were a perfect cocktail to induce fear, and therefore, remove the ability to learn and process effectively, for many. Fear Cancels the Placebo Effect: Why This Matters Increased fear is linked to the release of a substance in the brain called cholecystokinin (CCK). This substance has two effects; it increases pain and it blocks opioids. The media can also have an effect when they hype the threat of diseases or medical problems, making the public anxious or doubtful. \u2013 Psychologist Peter Solvoll Lyby. Interestingly, in a Norwegian study, they established that fear cancels out the placebo effect. Lyby noted that \u201cwhen you tell a person that he or she is getting a pain-killing pill, you create the expectation of pain relief, and pain is reduced.\u201d However, \u201cthe people who received no placebo relief in pain tests had a tendency to experience more fear and anxiety about the pain.\u201d \u201cWe have a pain-relieving system in our bodies that is switched on when we skin a knee, for example. The injury causes our bodies to release opioids to the brain,\u201d explains Lyby. But when frightened, a different substance is released that hinders opioids from functioning. Why does this matter? Because the constant ramblings by media making repeated false claims about therapeutics not working seeded doubt in millions of minds, while they continued to push exaggerated death tolls knowing full well the fear could strip a person\u2019s natural ability to heal themselves. CIA Documents on Brainwashing and \u201cLearned Helplessness\u201d The purpose of all coercive techniques is to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist. \u2013 C.I.A. Human Resource Exploitation Manual In a 2014 New York Times article titled \u2018Architects of C.I.A. Interrogation Drew on Psychology to Induce Helplessness,\u2019 Dr. Charles A. Morgan III, a psychiatrist at the University of New Haven, studied American troops\u2019 levels of compliance and suggestibility concluding that \u201ca subset became more compliant, but the vast majority also became more suggestible when given misinformation. Essentially you\u2019re making people less reliable and more stupid\u201d after confinement, sleep deprivation and other tactics were used. In a C.I.A. document titled \u2018Brainwashing from a psychological viewpoint,\u2019 they quote Jules Romains \u2013 \u201cWe know now that men can be made to do exactly anything\u2026 It\u2019s all a question of finding the right means. If only we make enough trouble and go sufficiently slowly, we can make him kill his aged parents and eat them in a stew.\u201d The 92-page document is about communist control techniques, interrogation, and to increase understanding of the \u201cbrainwashing process.\u201d They examined over 300 classified and unclassified documents related to Soviet and Satellite techniques of interrogation and brainwashing for this study, in addition to other research and Chinese indoctrination tactics. Interestingly, they state that the term \u201cbrainwashing\u201d originated by a reporter who was interviewing Chinese refugees. \u201cWhen reduced to extreme dependency and confusion, the individual is ready to react favorably to any person or idea which promises to end his painfully confused state. At this point, the re-education begins.\u201d \u201cOne to two million Americans will die. Oops, our models were wrong.\u201d \u201cSterilize everything in your home daily! Oh, never mind, it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an aerosol virus. No it\u2019s not. Yes it is. Oh wait.\u201d \u201cWear a mask. They will protect you. Don\u2019t wear a mask \u2013 we need them \u2013 they won\u2019t protect you. A mask won\u2019t help you and may only stop a droplet or two, but repeat after me \u2013 I am wearing a mask to protect other people because I care and I am a wonderful person. A scarf, a cloth, a mask that says right on the box they won\u2019t protect you from Covid \u2013 all of those will do just fine. Excellent. Now let\u2019s see if we can get them to wear 2 or 3 masks at a time\u201d \u201cYou are non-essential. And you are non-essential. And you over there \u2013 you are non-essential as well. All of you close your businesses and starve your families now!\u201d \u201cThe process of brainwashing is essentially one in which two paths are being followed. One is the demoralizing process, the result of which is to reduce the victim\u2019s critical faculties to the point where he no longer discriminates clearly between true and false, logical and illogical. The other is the reorganizing process, in which he is required to construct his confessions, elaborate it, defend it, and believe it.\u201d \u201cKids are super spreaders \u2013 close the schools! We need kids back in school \u2013 open the schools! Little Johnny has a cold \u2013 shut the entire school down and quarantine everyone! Call your neighbors, call your families, call the strangers you may have walked past! Children are depressed and becoming suicidal \u2013 we need to open the schools! The teachers unions won\u2019t teach until they get vaccinated by a non-vaccine we are just calling a vaccine, so as not to confuse people.\u201d \u201cTrust us \u2013 the tests are very accurate \u2013 don\u2019t listen to conspiracy theorists. Well, if the cycle threshold is over 36 it could create a false positive. Hold the fort! We need to reduce the threshold, too many tests are coming out false!\u201d \u201cHundreds of thousands of people are dying FROM Covid. Well, we are counting anyone who tested positive (with false tests and asymptomatic included) WITH Covid as a Covid death, even if they died from influenza, heart attack, dementia, a car accident, or a gunshot wound. But, but 450,000 people have died FROM Covid!\u201d \u201cThe most deadliest respiratory virus in the world may show no symptoms. At all. But\u2026. But, asymptomatics are super spreaders! Oh, just kidding. They actually only have a household spread rate of less than 1%.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you dare go within 6\u2019 of anyone. ANYONE! No hugs, no handshakes, no sex! Everyone take to the streets and protest by the thousands with Black Lives Matter as they swap sweat, loot stores, burn businesses, and torment people at restaurants, so you too could have an opportunity to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d \u201cWash your hands. Wash your hands. Don\u2019t forget to wash your hands. If you are already OCD, do it ten times more for good measure.\u201d \u201cWe cannot get back to normal until we have a vaccine. Then, everything can reopen, people can get back to school and work and get back to normalcy. We only need 70% of people to vaccinate for herd immunity. Psych! We lied. We need more like 90-95%, and by the way, it\u2019s not a vaccine and it won\u2019t prevent you from getting the virus, it will just help your symptoms, so masks and social distancing are still required\u2026with no end in sight. We just call it a vaccine to bring you comfort.\u201d \u201cStay in your homes. Quarantine. Isolate. Ditch Thanksgiving and Christmas. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 there\u2019s facetime. Smile for China, while we enjoy our holiday meals at a fine restaurant.\u201d \u201cIt should be noted that brainwashing, so defined, does not emphasize what happens to the individual, but what happens within him. The change represents a more or less complete re-education of his value system. This change is brought about in a rigidly controlled environment using pressures designed to create and sharpen internal conflict within the individual. The individual is forced to resort to problem-solving behavior, and the net effect is the brainwashed state.\u201d \u201cHow dare you pray in church. If you want to pray, you do it in a Walmart shopping line, where you can\u2019t get infected! And don\u2019t think having a funeral for your loved ones is acceptable either.\u201d \u201cSince you are willing to wear your mask while alone in the car, hyperventilating while riding a bike, or in the comfort of your home, we would also like you to wear it from the front door of a restaurant to the table, whereby you can then take it off to infect whomever you would like.\u201d \u201cChip?! Nonsense! There will be no chip or tracking. It\u2019s a conspiracy theory! Just because we are telling your neighbors and family to tattle on you, creating contact tracing surveillance, calling your homes, breaking HIPAA laws, and developing vaccine ID passports that will allow you to travel and eventually shop or leave your home, doesn\u2019t mean we will be chipping you \u2013 at least not for another year or so.\u201d \u201cHydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t work as a prophylactic and can be dangerous. Haha, we got you on that one, didn\u2019t we?! For nearly an entire year! Just kidding \u2013 we know Hydroxychloroquine works. In fact, we knew it back in 2005. We now approve of it.\u201d \u201cWe need to protect our elders because they are the most vulnerable, so you can no longer spend time with them and all nursing homes are on lockdown, except for the ones that are being sent thousands of Covid positive patients by Gov. Cuomo.\u201d \u201cWe need to release thousands of prisoners from prisons across the country so they don\u2019t get infected with the deadliest virus in the world that has a 99.82% survival rate. Anyone who dares open their non-essential business will be hunted down, arrested, and thrown in jail!\u201d \u201cTwo simultaneous processes are present. The first is characterized by a progressive deterioration and demobilization of the individual\u2019s critical and judging capacities. In a true sense the individual loses all sense of perspective. The second process is the learning of beliefs he would previously have rejected, as he seeks to gain some structure for his crumbling personality\u2026. These processes are most effective when the individual has gaps in his knowledge, or his understanding of the meaning of certain events is sufficiently tenuous that he has little difficulty in accepting a new and different interpretation.\u201d \u201cDid we say you could visit with your neighbor? You can only visit with immediate family in your own home. If you spot your neighbor doing that, be sure to call the police on them. Only movie production companies that are creating the future reality of the enslavement of mankind under the guise of Covid are allowed to gather together by the dozens.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 we got you covered. We are sending out a $1200 stimulus. It\u2019s the first of 3 and we may keep doing it every month. Sorry, we got so caught up in our own politics, that we decided to blow you off completely \u2013 for an entire year. The more people starving and out of business, the better. Relax, $600 is coming your way. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cSince we are so convincing with all of the above, we would like to go all in and stoke massive racism to create division and battles, more fear and confusion in children, and because we love watching you all flip around like fish on a hook. While we\u2019re at it, we are going to get back to extracting millions in taxpayer dollars for climate change \u2013 the world\u2019s next biggest threat \u2013 at least until we decide to tell you another pandemic has hit, since we\u2019ve already forewarned you. Our 15-minute dystopian cities are coming to a location near you soon! After all, the only way to see our 2030 agenda through, is to keep you dependent on us and in fear for as long as we can. Did you really think that we only needed 4 weeks to flatten the curve? We\u2019ve been at this for decades. The $90+ billion AIDS slush fund, measles epidemic, and H1N1 were all just test runs to see how much control we could possess over you. If nothing else, we are consistent and persistent. You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet!\u201d \u201cCommunist control of the individual and the masses is little different from controls exercised by virtually all absolute forms of government, past and present.\u201d Confused? Short-circuited? Feeling a little schizophrenic? In fear? Angry? Depressed? Demoralized? Broke and jobless? Don\u2019t worry \u2013 they have your back. Can\u2019t you see that? Side note: Since the CIA reorganized their entire website and moved documents around, making past links null and void, Corey\u2019s Digs has downloaded the above study here. For however long the link shall remain on the CIA\u2019s website, that can be found here. What\u2019s the first thing you think of when you see this image? How does it make you feel? How about this image? How about this piece of likely propaganda out of China? Repetition and conditioning alter your brain, your behavior, your emotions, and your health. In this case, in a negative manner. Are they protecting you or endangering you? What have you observed and witnessed with your own eyes? Expert in Deception, Psychological Operations & National Security Speaks to Cadets at West Point Think about it. If you change the past, you change human behavior. To change human motivation, we don\u2019t have to persuade people, you can just change their memory. \u2013 Dr. Charles Morgan Dr. Charles Morgan, Professor of National Security Studies at the University of New Haven and formerly worked at the CIA, who was mentioned in the 2014 New York Times article above, spoke with faculty and cadets at West Point in 2018 on psycho-neurobiology and war. In this profound presentation, Morgan talks about gene slicing, DNA encryption, and mind, body and beyond. His research is focused on enhancing the detection of deception and on improving the indirect assessments of human personalities. His resume reads like a science fiction novel. Morgan covered some very fascinating things in this seminar that have long been in place, some that are in progress, and some that are about to become reality very quickly. The mind tactics were quite intriguing, to say the least. \u201cBelieve what you remember, but don\u2019t assume that what you remember is true. What information is real and what information is trustworthy? By changing the past (inserting fake memories) it alters the future.\u201d By using stress tactics, they can change what people believe to be true by simply inserting something into a video or phrasing questions or information a certain way, and they can get a person to believe guns were in the room if they weren\u2019t really there. They can change, remove, and insert memories. Morgan says that if you continue to expose people to misinformation, they will adopt it as real. Right now, the world is witnessing this firsthand, only the misinformation is primarily coming out of the powers that be, while trying to inform the world that millions of people are the ones producing misinformation. This is called projection. Morgan explained manipulation tactics used through social media, stating that \u201cin the current social media age the ability to actually manage people\u2019s memories and change them has just enhanced from what it used to be. Now you can fix videos and pictures and expose people to audio and visual information, and we know that even if they know that\u2019s a possibility people don\u2019t recognize when they adopt a false memory . You don\u2019t know that it\u2019s happened to you. It bypasses some critical reasoning and is particularly effective.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where the state of the art is right now for creating false memories in humans by doing that verbally or by these manipulations, either by what we say, what we show them, what we expose them to, but the chemical implanting of memories has now occurred in monkeys. We should see that science in the next two years (seminar was in 2018).\u201d Morgan also spoke about the study they did in 2017 whereby they gave college students the false memory that they were terribly hungover from alcohol. A week later they were given free range options at the bar and they declined alcohol at twice the rate of other students because they remembered a false memory of being sick the last time. In addition to the above, Morgan also talked about DNA, gene editing and splicing, other technologies, and how they already have the ability to gather information from a person\u2019s brain while they are sleeping, in addition to training new information and memory into the person, outside of their awareness while they slept. Morgan was especially excited and giddy about DARPA\u2019s deep brain implants. DARPA covers a bit about their future of brain-machine interfaces here. The Road Ahead They want you frail, jobless and penniless, in a state of confusion and fear so that you are fully dependent on them. If this is not obvious, you are not paying attention. If you cannot see the writing on the wall, and are unable to cast aside fear long enough to review actual data and the misinformation they have perpetrated, then unfortunately, you have already enslaved yourself. One thing I learned long ago \u2013 anger supersedes fear. When you are angry you cannot function from a place of fear. Fear ratchets up one\u2019s perception of risk. Anger serves a purpose, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Though it\u2019s not an emotion to bask in for hours, it does allow clarity of getting in check with yourself and reality, while fear is suppressed. There are millions of people living in fear right now that need to get angry. They need to recognize what has been done to them and their livelihood, and they need to rise above that fear, take a stand, and take their power back. Obedience is voluntary enslavement, masks are a symbol showing submission, and closing your business is self-sabotage. This may be the only time in history where everyone is truly a victim at the same time \u2013 and it\u2019s not from the virus. Everyone needs to feel the sense of betrayal and being a victim to find the rage within. This is righteous anger and it needs to be acted upon, not through violence, but most definitely not through silence. If people do not take a stand now, the middle class will be entirely wiped out, the \u201celites\u201d will continue to syphon all the wealth, and the poor will remain poor. Corey\u2019s Digs has been trying to warn of their \u201cplan\u201d for quite some time. People have now been watching some of it roll out, and it\u2019s full speed ahead. By utilizing a virus with a 99.82% survival rate, they are gaslighting people into giving up their lives, lifestyles, jobs, school, finances, homes, relationships, joy, and the ability to have a voice. They are intimidating and censoring people who dare question anything, report data straight from VAERS, or go against the narrative in any way. Why is this? Because they want to control all of those aspects in your life. Vaccine ID passports are the beginning of the end, and they will be tied to a new currency in the future, whereby you will no longer be able to travel, buy groceries, go into retail stores (what\u2019s left of them), attend school, or walk down the street, without this stamp of approval. Even with this passport, you will be surveilled and controlled with ongoing \u201cmandates\u201d that will never cease until they reach their ultimate goal \u2013 they own you. Perhaps this was a hard pill to swallow years back, but after having a front row seat and going through what you have gone through this past year, the light bulb should have turned on. Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them. \u2015 Ralph Waldo Emerson",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.coreysdigs.com\/u-s\/covid-19-stimulus-package-tips-for-those-struggling\/",
        "text":"The impact of COVID-19 has swept the nation and seeped its way into every American household. It\u2019s the ripple effect coming on like a tidal wave, that everyone wanted to swim away from. Unfortunately, we are all caught in the swimming pool, and the 40% of Americans who are self-employed are taking a hard hit, while many working for big corporations are now telecommuting. Everyone who runs a one-man-show, a small business with a few employees, freelances, is a contractor, drives for Uber, does gigs, journalism, is an independent accountant, realtor, hair stylist \u2013 you name it \u2013 they all fall into the category of self-employed and are anxiously awaiting the stimulus packages to be confirmed and kick in quickly. Sure, the big corporations are feeling the heat and the airlines and cruise lines are tanking, but let\u2019s be real \u2013 if Americans go broke, rescuing the airlines or cruise lines will be pointless. They are in the final stages of negotiating phase two of the stimulus bill, and intend on working on phase three quickly as well, with more to come, they say. They are discussing the possibility of sending checks out to all Americans, with exception of the higher income individuals. What does that mean? We haven\u2019t been told, other than Mnuchin stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear we don\u2019t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks.\u201d Some Democrats have proposed anywhere between $1000 and $2000 per individual, while tossing around ideas of sending additional payments out quarterly should health and economic emergencies continue. Most seem to agree that getting cash into people\u2019s pockets quickly would be better than doing a payroll tax cut. They have also extended the tax due date of April 15th to July 15th, but if you have money coming back, most certainly file by April 15th! They are ironing out details around paid sick leave, paid childcare leave, unemployment insurance, food stamps, small business loans, and other means of helping people at this time. I believe we will know much more by the end of this week, as they have said they intend to get phase two wrapped up quickly. So hang tight. What Can You Do Right Now? I Can\u2019t Pay My Mortgage or Rent Banks and landlords are fully aware of the situation, and many banks are stepping up to work with you. Contact your mortgage lender and discuss your options with them. I do not believe, that with the national emergency we are currently in, a lender is going to foreclose on you and boot you to the curb. In fact, some governors are requesting that foreclosures and evictions be halted at this time. That said, a discussion still needs to happen to see how you might defer payments and avoid any additional fees, so call them. Many landlords are holding off on evictions if people can\u2019t pay rent, because honestly \u2013 who in the heck are they going to rent to right now? Talk with your landlord about the situation, don\u2019t just blow them off. Show a little respect \u2013 it will go a long way, and they will likely be sympathetic to your situation, especially with governors requesting landlords to work with tenants. Just remember, for the landlords who are smaller scale, they are taking a big hit right now as well, so be equally sympathetic to them. Maybe there is even something you can do to help them out with other tasks since you are unable to pay rent. What About My Utilities? The government has urged all water companies to keep services on, even if people are unable to pay. Of course, individual states and providers all need to get on board with this, but being as \u201cwash your hands\u201d has climbed to number on the greatest hits chart, and your toilet paper has been hoarded right out from under you, it would be outlandish for them to shut off your access. You may need to make a little noise, but I believe you will be safe in this department. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the same goes for electric and gas, especially when it comes to the elderly. I cannot imagine the government or governors will not step in if utility companies start cutting access when people can\u2019t pay their bills due to loss of jobs over closures. If only they had just stuck with Tesla, instead of stashing away his brilliance, we would all have free energy right now anyway, right? In all cases, contact your power companies and discuss your situation with them and work something out. Obviously, most power companies allow energy payment plans that might reduce the monthly bill, but if you simply cannot pay at all right now, see if they will defer payments without accruing fees. Be pleasant on the phone with them. I find that most people truly want to help others, and if you request their help, they are more likely to engage with you to find the best solution. I know stress levels are high, but being snappy will solve nothing. Childcare Needs Most everyone is staying home right now. If you are one of the lucky ones who can continue to work and maintain a stream of income, but your child\u2019s school closed and you require childcare, see if a neighbor in need of funds could watch your child for a small fee, so you can help each other out. It\u2019s tight for everyone right now. Feeding My Family The stimulus package they are negotiating does have some relief with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). I believe they are waiving the work requirements, and may have already done so, so check with your state\u2019s SNAP office and see if you qualify. In fact, you may even be able to utilize SNAP to shop for online grocers. Here is a link to the main USDA website, but you need to contact your state because the requirement updates likely haven\u2019t been made to this site since this is all moving so quickly. If you are in a situation where you need food immediately, check with your local food pantries. And finally, be sure to check if you have an elderly neighbor that could use your help with picking up groceries for them, or any other needs they may have. What About My Cell Phone Bill? I don\u2019t believe cell phone companies are necessarily going to step up to the plate to defer payments for you. That said, there are some potential alternatives. For starters, most people are working from home, or lost their job and hanging out at home, being as most towns have temporarily become ghost towns, so you could consider hooking up a cheap landline in the interim. You can also get a free google voice phone number and talk with people right through your computer. Of course, email is always an option for communication as well. For those looking to connect with loved ones in other states, you could setup a free Zoom or Skype account and communicate with them through your computer, while enjoying getting to see them at the same time! They are both very easy to setup. I\u2019m not sure about Skype, but Zoom allows you to communicate for up to 40 minutes at a time (for free) before having to begin a new session, which really isn\u2019t such a big deal if you are just having conversations. Tip: The wifi in your cellphone will work if you do not pay your cell phone bill. The only thing that will not work is being able to call or text. However, if you setup google voice and google hangouts on your phone, via apps, you can utilize those to send and receive voice calls and messages. Note: your phone will not draw from your cell service tower that you cancelled, so you will need to link it to your home wifi in your settings. This means that while driving you will not have access to wifi, but when at someone\u2019s home or business location, you can tap into their wifi. You have now converted your phone into a fully operational communication device, and dumped your cell phone bill entirely. Poof, like magic! I Need My Internet and Cable! Yes indeed. During these times, most people are going to want to stay connected and have access to news and updates. If you are struggling with money, I highly recommend dumping cable and sticking with internet only. Now days, you can stream nearly everything to your television. You don\u2019t even need to buy one of the many \u201csticks\u201d available to do so. You just need an HDMI cord and can run it straight from your computer to your tv. Of course, if you are looking to stream Netflix or Amazon Prime, those are paid programs, but the fees are far less than what cable runs. If it\u2019s just news you are after, head to your favorite journalists, reporters, and show hosts websites, because mainstream news will spin you like a top with misleading stories. All White House press conferences can be viewed on their periscope online, so no cable is required. Another option would be to keep your cell phone bill and dump your internet and cable, then utilize your cell phone as a hotspot for your computer to get internet access. Be sure to check with your cell phone service provider to see if you have unlimited bandwidth and hotspot capability. Most plans generally provide both. Figure out the best way to consolidate your bills, while still being able to have full access. Also, be sure to check with your local cable and internet providers because they may be running special discounts due to our current situation. Always try to negotiate. I Can\u2019t Pay My Credit Card Bills Contact your credit card companies immediately and start negotiating deferred payments with no interest. Believe it or not, you may just be able to get them to reduce what you owe. I would imagine that most credit card companies are going to find themselves in this predicament and would be happy that you are calling them to come up with a plan. That said, before contacting them, be sure to review what your interest rate is and look into other credit cards offering lower interest rates, such as 0% APR, because I suspect we may see more of those popping up right now. Do You Have Business Insurance? If you have business insurance, contact your provider and see if you are covered for business interruption which protects against lost income. Due to the fact that we are under a national state of emergency, you may be covered. If you don\u2019t have business insurance, you might want to consider getting an Employer Identification Number (EIN) whether your business is a sole proprietor, LLC or corporation, so you can obtain business insurance in the future. You can apply for your EIN number online for free and get the number immediately. Review the information and see if an EIN is a right fit for you or not. File for Unemployment If you are completely out of work due to all of the closures, and are in a position to file for unemployment, I suggest doing so. I\u2019m sure the phone lines will be overloaded right now, but conveniently, you have the extra time to deal with it. Check your state\u2019s employment department to see what options are available to you right now. Other Helpful Tips \u2022 If you attend church, see if they can assist you with some of your needs. They oftentimes assist with financial situations. \u2022 Get with a few neighbors and discuss all of your needs. Maybe one home has internet, while another home has cell phones, and you can share services. Maybe one person still has work but needs help with childcare and can pay you a little bit or provide you with some groceries while you watch their children. Work together to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Helping one another out and the good old barter system is a great way to move through tough times. \u2022 It may sound crazy, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to scour job sites and craigslist to see if there are any telecommute positions available. Beware of scammers. Just at a quick glance, craigslist has telecommute jobs for online tutors, writers, technical support, telephone surveyors, etc. Tip: go to the jobs section in your area and in the left-hand search bar type in the word \u201ctelecommute\u201d to narrow the results, while leaving all categories open. \u2022 Take this time to focus on fine tuning your business, organizing, and planning ahead to branch out or expand on it in the future, once we get past the bumps in the road. You may even decide to change direction or start a new venture entirely. Take advantage of the downtime to brainstorm, and make it an enjoyable creative process. You may just find that you\u2019ve been wanting to shift into other areas, and now\u2019s your time to prep for that. We Will All Get Through This Together By Being Selfless It\u2019s already been a bit of a wild, stressful ride, hasn\u2019t it? Who ever thought we would live to see a shortage of toilet paper across the entire country? It\u2019s so incredibly insane, that we have to laugh about it, right? I\u2019ve never seen so many hilarious memes in my life! It is so very important to keep laughter in our lives right now, and even more important to maintain compassion and a sense of calm. Yes, the unknown is scary, but the unknown is where faith is found, and I know that millions of Americans have a strong faith that will carry them through this. I encourage everyone to see this time as a time of positive change \u2013 a challenge to yourself \u2013 to move through fear knowing you will be ok, to move through the unknowing with the power of faith, and to move through these obstacles in a positive light filled with creativity, community, and compassion for all of those around you that are in the same boat. As we move through these changes, embrace your family, your friends, your neighbors, and amplify love. No matter what changes lie ahead, we are stronger together, and together, we will get through this. While they continue to push the phrase \u201csocial distancing\u201d to get inside your mind, the reality is \u2013 we are all becoming one \u2013 because the power that holds us all together, is the complete oneness that we all feel by going through the same experience together, at the same time. If everyone were to pray at 11:11 am every day, in their own time zone, stretching the entire globe, covering every hour of the day, imagine \u2013 just imagine, the power we can all bring. I say \u2013 bring it! I, like many of you, are part of the 40% of Americans who are self-employed. Godspeed.",

        "text":"It appears the covid vaccine is disproportionately targeting Aryans for heart attack and death at lighting speed. Battle for the Mind in Spell-Casting over COVID mRNA Injections The big secret behind the mass vaccination campaign is that its pushers are exclusively Kabbalah JEWS. In fact, Kabbalah Jews have a long and seeded history of genocide perpetrated against Aryans of every continent spanning nearly the entire 20th century. Most notably, was the 1917 Bolshevik mass murder of upwards of 80 million Christians (Aryans) followed by Jew Stalin\u2019s Holodomor famine against the Ukraine in 1932-33 that let 80% of the Aryan population starve to death. Aryans They use the same Kabbalah game-plan over and over again because the dumbed down, mind-controlled goyim can never quite seem to figure out that Kabbalah Jews are genocidal psychopaths, hell-bent on Aryan extermination and worldwide depopulation. Mao\u2019s \u2018Great Leap Forward\u2019 was another of these Jewish Rothschild plots which attempted to genocide Chinese Aryans, to the tune of roughly 70-100 million. The parallels currently taking place with the vaccinations leaves no doubt that they are planning another mass depopulation of Aryans \u2013 the Kabbalah Jews existential enemy. Evidence of the vax being a race specific bioweapon against Aryans is beginning to emerge for those who can visually recognize the difference between Jews, Neanderthals and Aryans (aka; the 3 species of \u2018Humanity\u2019). Because if so, you will see Aryans are dropping like flies all over the Jewish web.

The Jews want you to believe that the Aryan race does not exist, because they are attempting to genocide it. However, Aryans do exist, and in fact are the majority population around the globe, in all ethnicity, dogmas and skin color. Hell, Hitler even fought WWII over it\u2026 The CDC, FDA, NIH and MSM in bed with big pharma, also are all exclusively Jewish. Jews are also the biggest pushers of the vaccine. Biden\u2019s Ethnic Jewish Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy Jewish Canada Federal Health Ministe Jean-Yves Duclos All Jews, except Merkel and Macron The vaccines are mRNA gene therapies, which can manipulate the DNA of certain individual racial groups, like Aryans, while leaving others, like Jews, alone. The covid vax hooks onto the human spike protein, Dr Lee Merritt explains in the video below, and it does different things depending on one\u2019s racial bloodline (Jew or Aryan) via the \u201cracial specificity pathway\u201d (aka; the ACE2 human pathway). Dr Merritt says people who have the most \u201cupregulation\u201d of the ACE2 pathway are \u201cWhite caucasions\u201d [Aryans] from Europe, at 56%. Dr Merritt further details upregulation ACE2 pathway of Jews is at 0%. Meaning, they are not affected by the vaccine which causes significant heart attacks and other ailments in Aryans via ACE2.

The source for this information is John Bolton\u2019s nephew, Greg T Dixon, a Masonic High school friend and informant deeply connected with Freemasonry. Nibiru, Kobe Bryant, Depopulation According to Dixon, Kobe Bryant is a top-level Mason fully aware of Nibiru\u2019s imminent return. Whereby, he made a Nike commercial depicting its reappearance (along with the Anunnaki). Kobe \u2018Black Mamba\u2019 Nike Commercial: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AJyV5deRnX Dixon said Kobe does not want to participate in the round up of citizens to be put into FEMA (death) camps before the return of Nibiru, and therefore decided to fake his death in a helicopter crash right before the roundup. In 1998, it was explained by Dixon how the elite want to use a virus to depopulate the planet, but are afraid to use a KNOWN existing plague virus due to the fact it would be traced back to bio weapons labs they control. AIDS: Man-made Bioweapon Created by Jew Run US Military Industrial Complex Therefore, they plan on using an existing virus currently NOT known to cause pandemic death, they could claim evolved into a plague virus on its own. Interestingly, there has been an outbreak virtually every election year since 1998, in preparation for such an event. Same psyop, different year. Dixon was born and raised in Kirkland, Washington, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, and location of the Life Care Center where it first appeared, where Dixon said he personally knows the directors of the facility. Kirkland Masons The city of Kirkland is a Jewish controlled municipality in a Blue (Jew) State full of corruption. Dixon has family who are Kirkland police officers, Deep State operatives, prosecutors and judges in the corrupted [King] county. In 1998, Dixon said the staff at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, claim they can cause the death of residents simply by the way they treat them while in their care at the facility, and that public liaison, \u201cTim Killian,\u201d could direct that to happen when required. As is reported, the coronavirus started in China, where Dixon said the city of Wuhan is populated majorly by Asian Aryans. Masonic Mao and U.S. Marxist Commie Bolsheviks (consisting of U.S. Jews via Rothschild) colluded in the 50s to bring forth Aryan intellectuals under Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward \u2013 Hundred Flowers Campaign.

What currently is taking place with Covid documents how Marxist Jews and Masons have aligned with China to depopulate the planet \u2013 with emphasis on the extermination of the Aryan race. Aryans exist in all parts of the world, found on every continent and skin color. Historically, European Jews (Rothschild) used the Opium Wars to exterminate Aryan Chinese via addiction. Jews, like Aryans, also exist in all ethnicity, including Chinese. The Opium Wars were the modern beginning of the alliance between European Jews and Chinese Jews to exterminate Aryans worldwide, including again later in China under Mao\u2019s \u2018Cultural Revolution.\u2019 The financial proceeds of selling opium were tremendous, and founded the bank of Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation, now known as HSBC, the modern historical beginning of the Jewish central banking cartel. The mainspring of this world government is the Masonic Jewish central banking cartel which controls the credit of most countries and creates the medium of exchange (credit, currency) out of thin air in the form of a debt to itself. Yale Skull & Bones is the secret fraternity attempting to exact an Aryan Genocide \u2013 thus, the Aryan skull and bones stacked in genocidal form. Currently, European and Chinese Jews are at it again (Aryan Genocide), this time using COVID. In early 2020, China staged a coronavirus outbreak and rounded up Chinese Aryans en masse, who were subsequently deposed. The Hollywood style disinfection production in China was merely fanfare for the Psyop that is currently being orchestrated on the rest of the world, aimed at Aryan genocide and depopulation. For the plan to work Trump had to ousted, and why the election was stolen. WWII was a battle over BLOODLINES, Aryan vs Jewish\/Neanderthal The bulk of the Third Reich were crypto Jews who fooled Hitler and used common Jews (Judaics) as \u201cHolocaust\u2019 pawns to foment the destruction of Germany and the formation of Israel \u2013 a Zionist false flag nuke state. Crypto Jews Himmler, Hess Mengele, Eichmann Jews Himmler and Eichmann carried out the execution of a Judaic eugenics pogrom aimed to blame Aryan Hitler and Aryan Germans for the atrocities at the internment camps, that ended up killing almost half the population of Germany in WWII. This WWII history is relevant in the current Covid scam as crypto Jews once again are mandating Yellow ID Badges for vaccination victims. Crypto Jew John Asplund And further, a Yellow Card System: The British database of vaccine injuries is called the Yellow Card system. In the first four months of this year, there are 888,196 adverse vaccine events and 1,253 deaths. Considering that the adverse vaccine reporting systems are not believed to capture more than 10% of vaccine injuries and deaths, just the US and UK alone from the beginning of the year until mid-July might have experienced 22,866,760 adverse health effects and between 299,190 and 639,280 deaths from Covid vaccines. This is an outcome worse than the claims for Covid.\u201d Gibraltar, Iceland See MASSIVE Covid Spike Despite Over 90% of Population Vaccinated The moral of the story-crypto Jews are at it again. They are the true NAZIS pushing a \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of Aryan genocide and worldwide depopulation. Jews Behind COVID: Crypto Jews Tedros and Gates Biden Surgeon General JEW The World Health Organization is an agency of the UN According to John Bolton\u2019s nephew, Greg T Dixon, a Masonic High school friend and informant deeply connected with Freemasonry, the vaccine is the kill shot Jews will be administering in conjunction with 5G. Dixon said they will use elements within the vaccine combined with 5G to create instant coronary death and paralysis at the flick of a switch. The \u2018element\u2019 in the vaccines appears to be graphene oxide. Pfizer vaccine 99% graphene oxide This deadly 5G combination is documented in the video below (beta test): This is why they need the majority of people vaccinated before they flip the switch, otherwise enough people will be left awakened to potentially exact immeasurable revenge. Vitamin D (sun) and glutathione appear to be the only measurable methods of removing graphene form the system post vaccination. In order for the vaccinated to be hit simultaneously by 5G and activate the graphene oxide, 5G has to be made available to ALL parts of the world. This is where Elon Musk comes in: Elon Musk launches 58 SpaceX \u2018internet satellites\u2019 in historic mission Musk Issues Bizarre Warning About Earth\u2019s Coming Depopulation and Says Mars Is Safer.

Meanwhile, China has no Covid cases, no lockdowns, and their economy is booming unlike everyone else, per the globalist plan for depopulation \u2013 as a weekend economic state cannot defend itself from a superpower like China and its massive military. From Dave Hodges I contend that the bioweapon was developed by the CHICOMS, in the Wuhan lab with the help of Democratic Party and Deep State operative, Anthony Fauci, in the manner described and revealed by Dr. Rand Paul in recent Congressional hearings. When we reduce these events to a lowest common denominator, the release of this bioweapon was, at least in part, designed to cause a change in how Americans vote. The major change was in the absentee ballots. Without these fraudulent ballots, Biden could never have generated enough fake votes to steal the election. Fauci, the CHICOMS, the Democratic Party and other unknown co-conspirators have the blood of millions of human beings on their hands.

By now most everyone knows 9\/11 was an inside job designed to destabilize the Middle East and take away American freedoms via the Patriot Act. With boatloads of purposely displaced Islamist currently flooding into Europe as \u201crefugees\u201d contrived from US wars, Europe is in great peril from a globalist onslaught \u2013 similar to our Southern boarder situation post-election steal. If you listen to the Alt-media regarding the cause of the collapse of the Twin Towers twenty years ago, they will, in unison, tell you it was \u201ccontrolled demolition\u201d done by explosives (or micro-nukes) strategically placed throughout the two buildings. Unfortunately, these people are either misled or intentionally misdirecting the schematics behind these structural failures on 9\/11. First, let\u2019s understand what really took place regarding the technology that took down the Twin Towers. Nikola Tesla\u2019s Death Ray or Particle Beam Weapon. Tesla worked on a particle beam weapon in the later years of his life that he hoped would end all wars. It would be so powerful that it would easily destroy anything the enemy would throw your way, even hundreds of miles away. If every country had such a weapon, war would be meaningless. While the ray was never built (and the plans for it mysteriously lost), the concept of mutually assured description was the cornerstone of the Cold War, as the sides with nuclear weapons did not dare attack each other. \u2013 Think Big It was Death Ray Tesla technology behind the false flag attack on 911 that incinerated the towers, according to John Bolton\u2019s nephew, Greg T Dixon, a Masonic High school friend and informant deeply connected with Freemasonry. Apparently, Tesla\u2019s Death Ray works on the principal of resonant frequency at the molecular level. Also more commonly known as Direct Energy Weapon (DEW). Dr. Judy Wood has isolated this rationality on her website drjudywood.com. She labels it \u201cDustification\u201d (DEW). Unreported hurricane Erin on 9\/11 off the coast of New York. HARRP blue beam technology derived from Tesla These DEWs are reportedly being housed in satellites covertly positioned logistically by Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk along with 5G satellite launches all across the thermosphere. Direct Energy Weapons can disperse resonant frequency vibrations from pinpoint up to an 80 square mile radius \u2013 so people are in deep shit from this technology \u2013 as Tesla stated. 100 Miles Square Raduis Seattle DEW technology was used on Coffey Park in Santa Rosa, California and is precise enough to split a house in two or wipe out an entire neighborhood in one shot. The onslaught of UFO disclosure is designed to provide cover for this technology to wipeout humanity before the return of Nibiru \u2013 by blaming Aliens. Project Blue Beam \u2013 They want you to believe aliens did it to you. Aryan extermination and depopulation are the essence of what is currently taking place with COVID and the lockdowns, before the imminent return of Planet X (Nibiru), which will pole-shift earth, according to Bolton\u2019s nephew. The lockdowns are designed to hit you where you live with DEWs upon the return of Nibiru \u2013 particularly ARYANS. Aryans are believed the chosen race of the Anunnaki \u201ccreator god\u201d Anu, who inhabits planet Nibiru, according to Jewish and Masonic theories. They Are Not Like Us \u2014 by Jack Harper Nibiru\u2019s return will pole-shift earth again as it does every 3,600 years, flooding out humanity right before Anu (\u201cGod\u201d) rebuilds his favored Aryan conservative race using the best-found purebred surviving Aryan genetics from the flood \u2013 an historic pattern Jews are attempting to stop from being repeated, by exterminating Aryans before Nibiru\u2019s fast approaching return. Nibiru Trajectory Basically, I estimate that about seventy percent of the present crisis on this planet can be fairly attributed to the machinations of [Jewish] Neanderthal-Semitic elements of the human population against the [Aryan] Cro-Magnon majority of the human population.\u201d \u2013 Michael Bradley A pole-shift will wipe out the Jewish\/Neanderthal New World Order and replace it with another Aryan Golden Age \u2013 as has happened multiple times before under the Floods of Noah and Exodus.

        "text":"Michael Palmer, MD and Sucharit Bhakdi, MD I only believe in statistics that I doctored myself. Winston Churchill 1. Background On August 29, 2023, Ivan Vilibor Sin\u010di\u0107, a Croatian member of the EU Parliament, posed the following simple and poignant question to the EU Commission: Per the European Medicines Agency\u2019s EudraVigilance system, how many people have been reported dead as a consequence (side effect) of receiving approved COVID-19 vaccines since the administration of these medical products began? On November 6, he received the following written reply from Ms. Stella Kyriakides, the EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety: EudraVigilance is a database collecting suspected side effects reported by the European Economic Area\u2019s (EEA) patients and healthcare professionals, i.e. medical events reported following the use of a medicine in the EEA.The fact that these events were observed following the use of the medicine does not mean that they were caused by it. They may have been caused by underlying medical conditions of the individual, by other medicines taken in parallel or due to other events entirely.Scientific studies investigate potential causal links in these temporal associations and most suspected side effects are not eventually confirmed as side effects. An unprecedent [sic] high number of people has been administered COVID-19 vaccines [1] and the number of reported suspected side effects is consequently much higher than for other medicines. As of 30 September 2023, EudraVigilance shows 11,977 spontaneous reports of suspected side effects with reported fatal outcome for all authorised COVID-19 vaccines. Only in very exceptional cases, deaths have been reported to be caused by the vaccine. One example is \u2018thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome\u2019 with adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines [2] for which warnings and contraindications have been included in the product information to inform healthcare professionals and patients and reduce risk of adverse consequences. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are causing excess mortality [3] and no safety signal for increased mortality with any of the authorised COVID-19 vaccines has been identified by EMA to date. In fact, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives. [1] Almost 768 million vaccine doses administered in EU and EEA countries. [2] https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41541-022-00569-8 [3] https:\/\/www.icmra.info\/drupal\/strategicinitiatives\/vaccines\/safety In this memo, we will dissect and rebut the position stated by Ms. Kyriakides on behalf of the EU Commission and of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 2. What significance should we assign to adverse events reported in connection with COVID-19 vaccination? Ms. Kyriakides observes that the filing of an adverse event report alone does not prove causality in this specific single case. This assertion is hardly controversial. However, should we therefore dismiss the many adverse events, including severe and fatal ones, which have been reported to EudraVigilance and to similar monitoring systems around the world? 2.1. Is the high number of reports simply due to the widespread use of the COVID-19 vaccines? In her reply, Ms. Kyriakides suggests that the high number of adverse events reported for the COVID-19 vaccines is due simply to the large number of injected doses. This raises the question of relative risk: is a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine equally likely, less likely, or more likely to result in an adverse event report than a dose of a conventional vaccine? Montano [1] has addressed this question by comparing the four major COVID-19 vaccines to all influenza vaccines used within the EU and the US, using data from both the American vaccine adverse events reporting system (VAERS) and the EU\u2019s very own EudraVigilance database. For the latter, his findings are summarized in Figure 1, which gives the risks of death, life-threatening reactions, and hospital admission associated being reported after each dose of a COVID vaccine, relative to the average of all influenza vaccines. Evidently, the risk is tens of times higher with each of the COVID-19 vaccines, across all three degrees of event severity. According to VAERS, the risk is even hundreds of times higher\u2014it would literally be off the charts in this figure. Montano\u2019s data were published in early 2022. EMA\u2019s own experts, and Ms. Kyriakides herself, should of course have already been on top of this highly concerning development, rather than waiting for an academic researcher to point it out to them. Their continued pretence that all is well even after this analysis had been put on the record is entirely indefensible. 2.2. Passive adverse event reporting systems are prone to under-reporting In her reply, Ms. Kyriakides contrasts the number of 11,977 reported fatalities with that of 768 million administered doses. This comparison might suggest that the absolute risk of death after a COVID-19 injection is indeed low, regardless of the relative risk compared to other, conventional vaccines. We should first note that the total stated by Ms. Kyriakides is suspicious. Independent researcher Brian Shilhavy, who has closely monitored both VAERS and Eurdavigilance, retrieved 46,999 reports of fatal cases from the latter system as of August 2022 [2]. With VAERS, similar discrepancies emerge between the numbers stated by officials and by independent analysts [3]. More fundamentally, however, we must observe that both VAERS and EudraVigilance are passive systems, i.e. they merely collect reports filed by healthcare practitioners or patients on their own initiative. It is generally understood that such systems are subject to significant under-reporting. A review on the subject, which surveyed 37 original studies, found that in most of these more than 90% of all adverse drug reactions went unreported (see Figure 2). Lazarus et al. [4], who looked at VAERS specifically, concluded that less than 1% of vaccine adverse events that occur end up being reported to this system. This estimate was made already in 2010, but we can see no reason to believe that the situation has substantially improved with respect to the COVID-19 vaccines. 2.3. Evidence of under-reporting of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events in EudraVigilance For EudraVigilance, we can derive clear indications of significant under-reporting by simply comparing the reporting rates between the system\u2019s member countries. This has been done in Figure 3. The highest ratio of adverse event reports per 1000 vaccine injections is shown for Iceland. However, in this case the vaccination count extends only to the end of March 2022, while the number of adverse events was counted on September 9, which will of course inflate their incidence. Similar caveats apply to Slovakia and Latvia. But no such distortion exists with the Netherlands, where the two dates differ by only one week. We can therefore use the Dutch reporting rate as a reference. In Spain, the reporting rate is only one eighth of the Dutch. Therefore, even if we very optimistically assumed that in Holland every single adverse event is reported, then we still would have to conclude that only one in eight adverse events gets reported in Spain. Also note the rather low reporting rates in the most populous EU countries\u2014aside from Spain, these are Germany, France, and Italy. Overall, the reporting rate from all listed countries, weighted for population and excluding the Netherlands, is 21% of the Dutch reporting rate. Even though this figure most likely still overestimates the true reporting rate, it indicates that the problem of under-reporting remains significant and serious. 2.4. Estimates of COVID-19 vaccine fatalities from a representative survey in the United States The above conclusions align with those arrived at by economist Mark Skidmore, based on a representative survey of COVID-19 vaccine decisions and experiences in the United States [8]. From his analysis of these data, Skidmore infers that approximately 278,000 vaccine-related fatalities had occurred already by the end of 2021, and within the United States alone. If a similar survey were conducted now, this number would likely be considerably higher. There is no reason to believe that the situation looks any rosier within the European Union. 2.5. Spikes in all-cause mortality correlate with COVID-19 vaccination Multiple independent investigators have examined the relationship between trends in all-cause mortality and the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. They find a striking correlation of spikes in mortality with the timing of vaccination campaigns [9,10]. Furthermore, a clear correlation can be detected between national trends in mortality and rates of vaccine uptake [11]. As but one example, Figure 4 shows how each spike in vaccine injections coincides with one in all-cause mortality; and from the relative magnitude of those coinciding peaks, it appears that each successive dose is more effective in this regard. Also note that in 2020 mortality did not exceed that in 2019\u2014obviously, the virus itself was not particularly deadly. This was of course already known before the vaccinations started, and it had been properly and formally published by leading epidemiologist John Ioannidis already in 2020, in the Bulletin of the WHO [12]. Such findings make it clear that the alleged \u201cemergency,\u201d which was invoked by the authorities to justify the extraordinary risky vaccination program, never existed. 2.6. On the proper use of passive adverse event reporting systems Hazell and Shakir [5] draw the obvious and appropriate conclusions from the widespread and significant under-reporting bias of passive reporting systems, explaining what such systems can or cannot be used for: The main function of the SRS [spontaneous, i.e. passive reporting system] is early detection of signals of new, rare or serious ADRs [adverse drug reactions]. These reactions may not have been detected by the relatively small numbers of patients included in premarketing clinical trials or by larger postmarketing surveillance studies. The SRS has the advantage of covering a large number of patients, i.e. the entire population, and a wide range of drugs. It is therefore a relatively cost-effective method of monitoring drug safety.The SRS does, however, have a number of limitations. Data from the SRS, when taken alone, do not accurately quantify the risk associated with a drug. In other words, EudraVigilance and similar institutions simply serve as early warning systems. While it must be understood that the magnitude of any signal from such a system will likely be underestimated, it can nevertheless be expected to highlight emerging problems quickly. Of course, this is exactly what occurred with the COVID-19 vaccines. EMA and the EU Commission, as the stewards of the EudraVigilance system, must therefore answer the following question: what did they do in response to this early and glaringly obvious danger signal? The only answer one can find on the public record is this: they did their best to bury it. 3. Is there really no proof of a causal connection to death and disease? Ms. Kyriakides asserts that \u201conly in very exceptional cases, deaths have been reported to be caused by the vaccine.\u201d She cites a single relevant study and suggests that the problem affects only or mostly the adenoviral vaccines, and that the public is already being appropriately informed and cautioned. In fact, and in contrast to the impression conveyed by Ms. Kyriakides, the number of published reports on fatal cases is substantial, in spite of widespread censorship. Ms. Kyriakides may find it instructive to peruse references [18\u201340], most of which attribute the death of one or more patients directly to vaccination, although some of the reports pertain to the deaths by COVID-19 of vaccinated patients, thus highlighting the futility of this \u201csafe and effective\u201d intervention. And as with the passive monitoring systems discussed above, we must assume that the number of published cases is only the tip of the iceberg. This is well illustrated by the work of Arne Burkhardt and Walter Lang, two emeritus professors of pathology, who have examined the autopsy materials of numerous patients that had died soon after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. As stated in our previous summary of their work [41], these cases had initially been autopsied by other physicians, who had certified the cause of death as \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cunknown.\u201d Burkhardt and Lang became involved only because the bereaved families doubted these verdicts and sought a second opinion. It is remarkable, therefore, that Burkhardt and Lang found not just a few but the majority of these deaths to have been due to vaccination, with a high or even very high degree of probability. We also must remind Ms. Kyriakides that the EMA, and by extension the EU Commission, were warned early on about the dangers of the gene-based COVID-19 vaccinations. In an urgent open letter to the EMA [43], a large number of physicians and medical scientists (also including the authors of this document) spelled out the risks and the likely key mechanism of acute vascular disease, many cases of which were already being reported very shortly after the vaccines had been approved for emergency use. This damage mechanism has since been fully substantiated by the histopathological studies carried out by Burkhardt, Lang, and others; and it has been found to affect not only the blood vessels but also organ-specific cells and tissues everywhere in the body. In one particularly important study, pathologist Michael M\u00f6rz has provided definitive evidence of a direct link between vaccine injection and destructive inflammation of the brain and the heart [44]. The patient in question, having experienced progressive deterioration after each injection, finally succumbed to the third one. 4. Conclusion The evidence of harm and death due to the COVID-19 vaccines, which emerged within mere days of their roll-out, has since become utterly obvious and devastating. EMA\u2019s failure to \u201cdetect a safety signal\u201d constitutes a safety signal all unto itself. This signal has been detected by the public, which is turning its back on the vaccines and, by extension, on Ms. Kyriakides and Europe\u2019s entire criminally negligent administration. The toxicity of the gene-based vaccines was understood and predicted even before they were introduced, and the anticipated central mechanism of such toxicity has since been abundantly confirmed. This is discussed in more detail in our recent book \u201cmRNA Vaccine Toxicity\u201d [45], which can be downloaded and read for free. The book spells out that the grave harm observed with the COVID-19 vaccines must be expected with future gene-based vaccines against other infectious diseases also. We hope that you will spread this message and share it with your friends and family. Notes References",

In these letters, which were signed by hundreds of physicians and scientists, we urgently warned of short-term and long-term dangers from COVID-19 vaccines, including clotting, bleeding, and autoimmune-like inflammation. We also demanded the immediate withdrawal of all experimental gene-based COVID-19 vaccines. Unfortunately, the vaccines were not withdrawn, and all of those adverse effects soon became manifest in abundance. Our scientific case against the vaccines has been laid out in a number of educational memorandums, in whose conception and realization Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi, MD has played a leading role. Prof. Bhakdi is uniquely qualified to speak on this subject with authority; you can find out more about him in this biographical sketch. In the two years that have passed, it has become increasingly clear that the gene-based vaccines were merely one step on the way toward the totalitarian control of society. This includes vaccine passports, which threaten public health and violate Nuremberg and other protections. We are warning that \u2018health passes\u2019 place coercive pressure on citizens to submit to dangerous medical experimentation, in return for freedoms that once were human rights. Other elements of this totalitarian agenda are the weaponization of mental health, the transfer of national sovereignty over public health to unaccountable international bodies, particularly the WHO, as well as the introduction of central bank digital currencies.

        "text":"The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today\u2014plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late. If the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible: The Mark of the Beast Passage Revelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) \u2014 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone \u2014small and great, rich and poor, free and slave\u2014 to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666. This passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long. It's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that. Not A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight) More importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count! Despite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that: Revelation 20:4 (HCSB) \u2014 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God\u2019s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands . This passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion. Click here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy Four Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark The first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15). The second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image\/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10). Understanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation \/ 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13). Once you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems\u2014including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.) Thus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations. But there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark. Refuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture The passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution. It points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs. (Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.) Article continues below... The End In 2026? It's Now Possible Since learning in 2001 that Yeshua must return in a Sabbath year, I've had to rule out three Sabbath year cycle windows for the final 7 years (2003-2009, 2010-2016, 2017-2023). With the next window (2024-2030) less than 7 years away, I'm ready to share why I believe, based on the real end time sign of Mt 24:14, that this can be the one. If it is, the \"birth pains\" (WW3 + Wormwood, Lk 21:10-11) would hit near its middle in 2026 with Yeshua returning in 2030. Find out what's changed to convince me about 2026 and what you can do about it... In summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark: The 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark Convinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture \"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal? Terrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it. Yet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking\/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)? A big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign\/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18): Exodus 13:16 (HCSB) \u2014 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand. Orthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative). But we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors\/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24). Why Only a Literal Mark Works Whenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast. This passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\" Revelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) \u2014 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels Now think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions. If the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure? Since a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand\/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it. But Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark? With that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark? This is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out: 3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes Mark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters\/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture) The first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now. Faith Needed To Obey the Warning By way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well. Similarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark. The faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive. It has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too. (Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps) No Visible Angels Another reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively. I think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men. \"My pastor said not to go\" It should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and\/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark. Then, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later). The mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2. Option 3, of mark evasion, will have expired. Why It's Not Already Here You may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple. That said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology. \"COVID Vaccines\/Passports Are the Mark!\" Along those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit: People say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666. So you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one. What Do I Think the Mark Is? Then what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society. Rev 13:17 \u2014 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. Considering that verse you can rule out a few things right off: The mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" Is trade\/bartering stopped, too?: What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark? If the mark is only an ID\/currency account, then I doubt trade\/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural\/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce. All that to say, when I consider the buying\/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast. What To Do Today To Escape the Mark Clearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions. The question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know: Luke 18:8 (HCSB)\u2014 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) \u2014 5 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201c Increase our faith .\u201d 6 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cyou can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) \u2014 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d Ever notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere. In the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it. If you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast. By the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation. What Not To Do... Lastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about. Conclusion The Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact. The proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did. For help on what aspects to focus on changing in your life, from Jesus' words, see my article on Rapture Requirements. P.S.

        "text":"What are the resurrections that will take place in the future? Which one will you and your loved ones be in? What are the underlying questions that many Believers have when they consider the future resurrections? Considering The Future Resurrections With Godly Balance- Most Christians believe in two resurrections to come in the future, while a few believe in three. The question might arise, does it truly matter whether it's two or three? At its core, the answer isn't crucial, as long as you can still affirm that God is good and His judgments are fair, righteous, and loving. Can you declare Him as good even if His judgments imply eternal non-existence or hell, as some believe? Addressing this subject often treads on the toes of many Believers, and it's challenging to approach without causing offense. But let me be clear: Our beliefs about the number of resurrections and what comes after death should not divide us! If we all are humble enough to realize that we see in part and understand in part (1 Corinthians 13:9-12), even if we think we see a situation clearly, we end up keeping our priorities in order of what really matters. And what really matters is this: God gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him will have eternal life. That Son came in the flesh, lived a perfect life, died for the WHOLE WORLD (including you and everyone you've ever known), was resurrected on the third day, and now sits at the right hand of our Heavenly Father. This demonstrates God's power to resurrect anyone and His desire to do so. We have a perfectly good God who loves ALL of His creation. He is The Creator who brought everything back to Himself through His Son. LOVE IS HIS MOTIVATION because love is who He is! Restoration of everything and everyone to Himself is His will and heart (1 John 4:8). He commands us to love Him completely and to love our neighbors as ourselves because He loves us (1 John 4:19, I recommend reading the entire chapter). Keeping these fundamental points in mind enables us to humbly discuss resurrections, accepting the possibility of being wrong, party right, or surprised by God's actions. Just as Christ's coming defied expectations, we should remain open to unexpected outcomes in these future prophecies. An open mind allows for surprises and corrections when these resurrections occur or are witnessed. What Are The Real Questions Concerning The Resurrections? Throughout the five decades I've lived as a Believer, I've learned that questions about the number of resurrections and how they work aren't the central concerns of those who wish to discuss this topic. These questions on the resurrections are often projected to avoid addressing the real, underlying inquiries: What does God have in store for me and my loved ones? Is God going to torment us or make us cease to exist? I'm scared we won't make it! Given my fears, can I genuinely view God as good now and trust Him fully with my life? I want God to punish those \u2018evil doers\u2019 who have hurt me and those I love! I want punishment for them, but I want those that I love to make it even if they have made mistakes. Is God righteous enough to judge the way I hope He will judge? Many have confessed these genuine questions to me and Tim over the years, while others avoid acknowledging these questions and become overly focused on interpreting resurrection prophecies to ease their hidden concerns. Such individuals can appear strict and judgmental toward those who hold different beliefs. They either cling to what they believe will emotionally and eternally 'save' them, imposing their beliefs on others, or they remain in a state of panic, unsure if they or their loved ones are safe. I admit that my words may seem bold. I do not intend to offend or belittle anyone. Strong reactions usually stem from unhealed fears and hurts. Healing those wounds takes time and is part of the ongoing sanctification process from the moment we commit to God and throughout our lives. I also plow through my own fears and hurts as they come up to be purified into love. We all have them so please don\u2019t hear judgment from me. I am merely using compassionate discernment to directly reveal what is usually really going on so that we can get the healing we need. My heart is always towards everyone\u2019s healing and restoration, my fellow humans. Somehow, we need to learn how to get love into ourselves so we can kick out that fear around eternal death, or hell, or even physical death. As 1 John 4:18 says- 'There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear is tormenting. He that fears is not make perfect in love.' Before delving into the overarching question of future resurrections, I choose to confront the true questions beneath the surface. This approach promotes humility and less fear when considering the resurrections. Tackling The Underlying Questions Step by Step 1. What does God have in store for me and my loved ones? Is God going to torment us or make us cease to exist? I'm scared we won't make it! God's essence is love and restoration. His nature is to save, heal, and love. He desires a relationship with every individual. This nature is evident through Jesus' actions, words, and His death and resurrection. He demonstrated love by preaching to the poor, healing the sick, releasing captives from demonic grip, raising the dead, and comforting the distressed. His sitting at the right hand of The Father is a testament to God's nature of resurrection and love. Christ's actions show that God's initial response isn't rejection or punishment. They will use rejection and punishment at the veeery end (the last resurrection) only because a human has been given CLEAR understanding and yet chooses to reject God. God is merely acting according to their free will choice. Our free will is an awesome gift from God. It also comes with our responsibility to make choices. I won't delve into the reason behind why we were created with free will, the allowance of suffering, and the choice to reject good, including God. This article would expand into a book. I've already written a book on these topics, which will be available as a free ebook. I aim to release it in October. Visit www.ownedbylove.com for updates on the book's release. In conclusion, understand that God's nature is love and restoration toward His creation, particularly humans made in His image. Article continues below... \"Depart From Me, I Never Knew you!\" - Jesus Jesus predicted that he will tell many sincere believers to basically \"get lost\" instead of welcoming them into the Kingdom. So...who are they and what did they miss or do wrong? In this study, get those answers and the one requirement for salvation Jesus taught (that Christianity misses) so that you can make sure you don't hear these dreaded words yourself! 2. Given my fears, can I genuinely view God as good now and trust Him fully with my life? This usually is where many people have built on sand and where Satan attacks. He attacks this area at just the perfect times when we have already built other beliefs on top of this fear to try to soothe the fear that we might not be able to trust God. Then Satan yanks us when our world crumbles due to illness, loss, or harm befalling our loved ones. The truth of our hearts is suddenly ripped to the surface. Violently exposed to the world is the hardening of the heart that was crouching in the darkness coming from distrust in God, and bitterness towards Him and others. The prediction that \"the love of many will grow cold\" (Matthew 24:12) comes to fruition. If you feel ANY feeling of not being able to trust God because you are afraid of His judgments toward you or those you love, then it doesn't take end-time events to get your love to grow cold. Satan is just waiting to help you get really stuck in this trap of bitterness toward God because of your fear of His judgment! This is why, my fellow humans, I am speaking directly to these 'hidden' questions underlying the question of future resurrections. You must face these real questions and get answers so that you will have the strength to make it to the end and stand before your Maker, seeing Him as merciful and not seeing Him as Satan sees Him (Luke 21:36) If you are afraid that you or someone you care for won't make it, and therefore you have an area that cannot fully trust God, then DO NOT PUT THIS AREA OFF AND IGNORE IT ONE MORE SECOND! It is an open door to your whole emotional and spiritual world falling apart sooner or later. And Satan does not care if it's sooner or later as long as it does enough damage for you to hate God like he does. I have yet to encounter a Bible believer who hasn't struggled with this issue to some degree. You are not alone. This is just an area that we all have to face and get some faith in. \"How do you get faith in this area to heal it?\", you may be asking. Good question!... The way I have found to help heal my own fears in this area is found in my other free ebook called Turning Fear Into Faith. To add something on top of what this book shares, I had to come to a place of just deciding that God is good whether I could prove it or not. And therefore, I could trust Him. Yeah, you most likely heard me- believing that God is good to you and those you love WITHOUT being able to prove it with empirical evidence is the only way out I have found. You just decide it is true because it makes you happier to believe than what you have been thinking. The decision is made purely by you and purely by faith. Whether we like it or not, trusting in the unprovable is a strong tenet of our faith. What I am saying sounds like craziness to most people. But I am telling you, by heavy personal experience, that forcing the self to decide to believe God is loving and trustable, even if it can't be logically or emotionally understood how it is true, was the only way for me to literally not lose my mind and die. I have not found another way to the breakthrough of not having the wrong kind of fear of God. I had to force myself to believe in the goodness of God no matter what I read in the Bible which sounded like the opposite. The areas that made me question God's goodness, I had to decide I just don't understand from my small human perspective yet. God will show me as I grow. I'm giving you spiritual treasure here to help you navigate life, death, and resurrections. These things I am sharing with you will help you take hold of the comfort God has already given you through The Comforter! 3. I want God to punish those \u2018evil doers\u2019 who have hurt me and those I love! I want punishment for them, but I want those that I love to make it even if they have made mistakes. Is God righteous enough to judge the way I hope He will judge? Every human of every age has struggled with this dilemma. We want mercy for those we love and we want justice done on those who hurt who we love. Do you see the hypocrisy in wanting this? Come on, my loved fellow human. Let's laugh together a bit at our humanness here! Our desire to protect those we love but have those who abuse whom we love comes from our inability to see from where God can see. God sees everything from the perspective of eternity and knows everything. We tend to lean towards the perspective we have from our confined temporary human life and limited knowledge. God is not subject to death or permanent injury, whereas we are. It is soooooo hard to forcibly 'deny the fleshly perspective and put on the new man' which decides God's perspective, God's desire, and God's understanding is better than our own (Ephesians 4:17-24). Therefore, Christ came to help us see more clearly how God's perspective of love is superior to our limited perspective, even when we are human as He lived while on this earth. God wants each of us to have the ability to directly choose forgiveness that is always there to have, or reject it. He lets us choose. That is one of His precious gifts to humans- free will to choose. It is one of the highest ways He created us in His likeness and image which no other creature has been given the privilege to have! Those people you hate, God loves. Who is wrong? Those people whom you reject, God desires to bring into His arms. For those people who have done heinous acts, God desires to forgive, heal, and restore. And the really good news is, He wants the same for YOU! Make no mistake, God despises certain things. He abhors Lucifer's choices and those angels who follow him. He detests when we resemble Satan rather than His Son, Jesus, which is our true identity and inheritance! A time will come when every human's choice will be examined, and rewards or consequences based on their choices will follow. Raise your hand if you would like to spend eternity with individuals who knowingly, and intentionally choose manipulation, exploitation, control, and imprisonment of others over God's way of love and peace. Any takers out there? If you raised your hand, reconsider your choice. There is still time to change your mind. How many of us wrestle with these ungodly traits we're attempting to shed? Are you honest with yourself right now? Will you ask God for help in desiring to become peaceful and forgiving as God forgives? Can you entrust judgment to the only One capable of perfectly judging with love? Hatred and indifference blind us- let's be honest. The Resurrections To Come Now we turn our attention to the resurrections in our future since the proper foundation of humility has been laid. The resurrections are a time when human choices have been made whether they chose God's way of love and peace for eternity, or they want to be selfish and care only about themselves and their agendas just like Satan does. Resurrection One: Is for those who have chosen in this physical lifetime that God's way rocks (Revelation 20:4)! They are either raised from the dead or changed within a twinkling of an eye into their glorified bodies that endure for eternity (1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16). This glorified group of humans are known as The First Fruits. Resurrection Two: This occurs after the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth where The First Fruits of the first resurrection reign with Him. This resurrection is back to another physical life. The people who come back to a second physical life include 1. Everyone who died during the six thousand years of man and did not qualify to become a part of The First Fruits in the first resurrection 2. Those who lived during the thousand-year reign of Christ who were not ready to be changed into glorified beings, or 3. Those who were born during the thousand-year reign. There is no information on how long this period lasts where a ton of people are brought back to a second physical life (Revelation 20:5 and Ezekiel 37:1-14) Resurrection Three: Known as the Great White Throne judgment. All those not already glorified face final judgment- either achieving glorification as part of the 'Latter Harvest' (also known as the Great Harvest) or they face being put into The Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). These are the three resurrections that I understand and Tim understood. Notice that everyone who was not glorified in the first resurrection will be brought back to another physical life in the second resurrection. This should bring comfort to all those who wonder if their loved ones will make it or not as they will have a chance to really know God and Christ and make a clear decision at that time. They will have a chance to be a part of the Latter Harvest\/Great Harvest. I am giving you an overview of these resurrections because many people have contacted me on this subject. It's puzzling that some find this topic confusing, considering Tim's comprehensive article on resurrections is clear and well-written. For those seeking further clarity and insights on these resurrections and the debates within The Body, I wholeheartedly recommend his article: Revelation's 3 Resurrections vs. Heaven\/Hell At Death In Conclusion God loves everyone and everything He has created and has a plan through Christ to give it a way of redemption to perfection- minus Satan and his debased angelic followers. God loves your loved ones waaaaay more than you ever could! He desires them to be saved stronger than you ever could want it. That is His heart. Trusting that God is one hundred percent good is the only FOUNDATION of walking out of the prison of emotional or psychological torture. The resurrections exemplify God's perfect love and judgments. And a personal note- I love you and I hope this article has helped you to see God's love for you and your loved ones.

Jenson, who was interning at a residence for autistic individuals, experienced a reaction to the vaccine just hours after being injected. She subsequently became so ill that she had to give up her education. Jasmin Jenson (photo: Tobias Stidsen) . Jenson is now on disability pension due to constant headaches, concentration difficulties, and nearly chronic fatigue. Her loss of working capacity has been assessed at 90 percent, leading to a compensation of approximately 11 million DKK (US$1.6 million), according to the report. This amount takes into account that she was only 30 years old when the injury occurred. The compensation would be paid out gradually, offset against her disability pension, and corresponds to the salary she could have earned as a healthcare assistant until she turns 73 in 2064, the age for public pension eligibility in Denmark. Jensen\u2019s employer, Fredericia Municipality, initially refused to report her case as a work-related injury, arguing that vaccination was voluntary. However, the case was reported only because Jensen herself did so with assistance from Danish trade union magazine, Fagbladet FOA. The Danish Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (AES) later overruled the municipality, determining that the employer had a special interest in Jensen being vaccinated. \u201cWe have considered that the health authorities recommend COVID-19 vaccination for specific employee groups and specific tasks, which includes your role as a social and healthcare assistant trainee,\u201d states the decision, which Jensen acknowledges: \u201cOur leader was very clear in urging us to get vaccinated. I didn\u2019t want to oppose it. It also played a role that I was to intern at a hospital later in the year, so getting vaccinated was the most sensible thing to do,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty extreme case, and it doesn\u2019t get any better by the fact that Jasmin is so young,\u201d says the union case worker from FOA Trekanten, Anne Blomme (tv).

        "text":"EU countries purchased 1.5 billion COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 but millions of those went unused | Lou Benoist\/AFP via Getty Images . Calculations based on available data show that EU countries have discarded an average of 0.7 jabs for every member of their population. Top of the scale is Estonia, which binned more than one dose per inhabitant, followed closely by Germany, which also threw away the largest raw volume of jabs. If this average waste rate is projected across the rest of the EU, it would equal more than 312 million destroyed vaccines. It\u2019s not easy to discover how many vaccines have been thrown out. Governments, including the EU\u2019s second-most populous country France, are reluctant to reveal the scale of the waste. POLITICO\u2019s calculations are based on numbers from 19 European countries \u2014 15 that supplied us with direct figures, and four where volumes were reported in local media. Some figures date from as recently as this month; the oldest come from December 2022. The passage of time means the figures we received are conservative, with the real number of discarded vaccines likely much higher. Germany, for example, provided its waste figures to POLITICO in June; at the time it had another 120 million vaccines sitting in storage. Vaccine-makers have also since introduced newer versions that are adapted to the latest coronavirus variants, making older jabs obsolete and more likely to be discarded. POLITICO estimates the value of the 215 million wasted vaccines at more than \u20ac4 billion, based on vaccine prices reported in the media (they have not been made public). For countries that only reported the total number of vaccines destroyed, without breaking it down by vaccine type, POLITICO used a weighted average price of \u20ac19.39 calculated from data given by countries that provided a breakdown. Again, this figure is almost certainly a minimum. But even \u20ac4 billion is a considerable sum, equal to a large infrastructure project or to the annual health care spending of Croatia. \u2026",

The episode reported on findings from Professor Brigitte K\u00f6nig\u2019s independent Magdeburg laboratory, which discovered substantial foreign DNA contamination in five batches of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine. The DNA levels found exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) limits, raising significant concerns over the safety of the vaccine used in global mass vaccination efforts. The research highlighted that the least contaminated batch contained foreign DNA 83 times over the WHO\u2019s limit, while the most contaminated batch had DNA levels 354 times above the safety threshold. These startling results have intensified scrutiny over mRNA vaccines\u2019 production and regulatory oversight. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Kirchner pressed for the vaccine\u2019s withdrawal under a specific clause in the Medicines Act, which mandates the removal of questionable products from the market. Kirchner presented these findings to the Bundestag\u2019s Petitions Committee in September 2023. SEE VIDEO HERE (2 mins) This development is quite substantial.

        "text":"The Delta Variant Quite Possibly The Ultimate Reason Why the Mass Vaccination Program must Stop and Why We Must Focus our Efforts on Treating the Infection & The Resulting InflammoThrombotic Response (ITR) Known as COVID. In 2019 the release of SARS-CoV-2 was followed with a warning by a few of us, that this Gain-of-Function virus had significant regions within it's genetic code that should concern all of us. More than a year later and more than 4-million deaths world wide we are looking at the evolution of this man-made virus; evolution we expected to see and here it is. Viruses like all life, including this man-made virus, evolve to survive. Viruses depend upon a host to live and reproduce itself. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 that means people. If the virus becomes too dangerous and kills you, then the virus will NOT survive and will not be able to spread to other people. It will die inside you. [Yes, a few might escape before you die, but this is not going to continue very long before the virus can no longer escape.] Viruses evolve to survive. When pressure is placed on a living organism, those that are too weak or susceptible to the pressure will die; leaving only those without that weakness alive to survive and perpetuate the next generation. In the next section you will see how this relates to bacteria and antibiotics. Later we will see how this relates to SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines. When you become infected with a bacteria, or a virus, or something else, your immune system will try to fight off the infection. As I have talked about elsewhere on this website, and in multiple videos on this website, the first part of your immune system, called the innate acute T-cell response will recognize the infection in approximately 3-5 days. Following this, your body's immune system will release a series of chemicals designed to kill your infected cells and to form blood clots to both starve the infected area and try to reduce the spread of the infection to other parts of your body. Other chemicals are released to try to prevent the infection from reproducing itself. This is the beginning of the InflammoThrombotic Response (ITR) I have talked about since 1994. If the infection is not brought under control during the first 3-5 days and the infection continues to grow and multiply, a back up system helps you bring the infection under control. This part of your immune system is called the delayed adaptive humoral antibody system. This part of your immune system requires B-cells, the antibody producing cells, and occurs roughly 7-10 days after you become infected. The goal of this part of your immune system is similar to the the T-cell response. Chemicals are released to cause harm to the invading virus (or bacteria, or fungus, et cetera) and the cells of your body that are infected. These chemicals cause blood clotting to wall of the invader and starve it to death, as well as kill infected cells. The one additional thing that this delayed adaptive humoral antibody system does is to produce antibodies. Antibodies are built by your immune system, that recognize and attack something foreign to your body; viz. the specific cause of infection. This foreign material is called an antigen. Antigens that are part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the spike protein) is what the PCR test tries to find. When used properly PCR will look for the genetic code that makes the proteins found in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Once made, these antibodies then attach themselves to the invading antigen (e.g. virus) in an effort to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting and harming your body. If you become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because someone else transmitted it to you (person-to-person), you will not only have an innate T-cell response that will release chemicals to attack the virus; you will also make antibodies to all of the virus; not just part of it. However, if the only thing your body sees is the spike protein produced inside your cells because you took a drug vaccine biologic that infects your cells with the genetic code to make a specific single type of spike protein, then the only immune response you can make is to that specific type of spike protein - nothing else; unlike natural immunity obtained by person-to-person transfer. There will be no T-cell or B-cell (antibody) immunity to the other parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or to other variants of the spike protein, because your body will not have seen those parts of the virus or other variants of the spike protein. You will have no immunity to spike proteins that look structurally different from that produced by your cells according to the genetic code injected into your body by the drug vaccines. This means that if and when you become exposed to a different variant of SARS-CoV-2, and there will never be only one type of SARS-CoV-2 virus floating around, any more than there will be only one type of person floating around, then you will have little or no immunity based upon the drug vaccine itself. If you have acquired (obtained) natural immunity due to being infected by the virus, then you will have an immune response (immunity) to all the various parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and you will not be dependent upon a specific antibody to one version of the spike protein to protect your body. You will also most likely have been exposed to more than one variant of SARS-CoV-2 and will develop antibodies (and T-cell response) to the different variants. If however your immunity is dependent upon being vaccinated to a specific version (variant) of the spike protein, then the T-cell and B-cell (antibody) response will recognize that version (variant) of SARS-CoV-2. That version (variant) of the virus will undoubtedly be successfully attacked, while the other versions (e.g. the Delta variant), most likely will not. These other variants will survive to infect you and others as you share the infection. This process of one variant surviving while another is killed off, is called Natural Selection; however, it is a very specific type of Natural Selection as it is the result of human intervention. This type of natural selection is called SELECTION PRESSURE. Namely, the variants which do not have the same spike protein you made antibodies to from the drug vaccine, will be the ones that survive. Since vaccines do not prevent infection (they shorten the amount of time it takes your body to respond to the infection), and vaccines do not prevent you from transmitting\/spreading the infection; then the drug vaccines are putting SELECTIVE PRESSURE on SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a survival advantage for Delta and other variants whose spike proteins are sufficiently different from the spike proteins made after the drug vaccines infect our cells. This means that the vaccination programs are selectively promoting the survival and spread of the variants INCLUDING THE DELTA VARIANT. This can be seen by looking at the change in SARS-CoV-2 variants following vaccination campaigns (as shown below). Vaccines Do NOT Prevent Infection. However, vaccines can reduce your symptoms thereby making you an asymptomatic or less symptomatic carrier - including a Delta Variant Carrier. An Example of Medically Induced Selective Pressure Upon Bacteria Following the Indiscriminate Using Antibiotics. To better understand how human intervention can encourage one form (variant) of an infectious agent to survive while killing off others; let's look at an all too common medical problem faced every day by physicians. Antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, which in some instances can be life threatening. An Example of Medically (Government) Induced Selective Pressure Upon SARS-CoV-2 Following the Indiscriminate Use of Experimental Vaccines. Prior vaccination programs have developed vaccines using attenuated (weakened) versions of a particular virus. Not a single variant or version of the virus, but most if not all of the versions of the virus that you might come into contact with. These vaccines successfully eradicated many of these diseases, allowing people to develop memory cells (both T and B-cells) for long term immunity and protection. In some instances they totally eradicated the diseases protecting future generations. As a result of these well researched and thought out vaccine programs, programs that took many years to do correctly, immunity in vaccinated individuals developed to all parts of the virus (or bacteria) and not just a single variant of the virus. Consequently we did not see variants of these viruses popping up around the world, and we did not have to reach some magic (as it keeps changing) level of vaccination. The Forced Mandated Vaccination Programs Were Followed by Selective Pressure Evolution of the DELTA & other Variants. If we look at the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the mass drug vaccination programs occurring, we can see that the variants have followed the vaccination programs. This suggests either (1) the variants are part of the drug vaccines themselves, or (2) that the drug vaccine programs have resulted in the Selective Pressure to give a survival advantage to variants like DELTA. Either way the data shows a clear relationship between the vaccination programs and the SELECTION of the Variants like DELTA. The Greater the Mutational Change in the Spike Protein from the Original SARS-CoV-2, The Greater the Difference in the Structure of the Spike Protein in the Variants, The Less Effective the Vaccines Have Become, The Greater The Spread of the Variants Around the World. By July of 2021 The Global Pattern for SARS-CoV-2 Variants Was Alpha (V1), Beta (V2), and Gamma (V3). the Dominant SARS-CoV-2 Variant Has Become DELTA. https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2021\/world\/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html https:\/\/covariants.org\/variants\/21A.Delta As the Following Graphics Show 2-Weeks Following Mass Vaccination Programs Accelerate World Widethe Dominant SARS-CoV-2 Variant Has Become DELTA. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/covid-19\/health-departments\/breakthrough-cases.html With Still Further Selective Pressure Seeing Variant Shifts to 21A Delta S K417 As of 2 August 2021 The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 7,525 cases of Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 cases in people vaccinated in the United States. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/covid-19\/health-departments\/breakthrough-cases.html When added to the 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Cases from January to April of 2021, the CDC has recognized 17,787 Cases of Individuals Diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 Infections After Being Vaccinated. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/70\/wr\/mm7021e3.htm",

Once inside the body the virus will invade our cells and reproduce itself. In response to the virus our immune system will attack the invader launching first a response from T-cells designed to kill the cells infected with the virus and later an antibody response designed to kill the virus before it gets into another cell. This diagram also shows how too much of a good thing can cause harm to the body. When our VIRAL immune response, either because of other health problems we have (comorbidities) produce too much response OR because there is too much of the virus (e.g. vaccines) in our body; the outcome is INFLAMMATION and BLOOD CLOTTING [InflammoThrombotic Response \u2013 ITR] that can kill us (COVID-19).

        "text":"ADD TO MY ARTICLES We recently visited Laurentine's mother in Spain on family holidays, and we got COVID-19. We found out while we were at the airport about to fly to Australia via PCR test. At first, it was Laurentine and Rangi, and then it spread to Hugo and me. We went into home quarantine at a villa in Spain, and here's what we did to minimize symptoms and boost our recovery time. DISCLAIMER #1: Given it's COVID-19 and the world, and social media censoring, is going a little crazy over this, we need to re-confirm that this is what WE DID and NOT MEDICAL ADVICE! DISCLAIMER #2: I follow a policy that if it is natural and found to be helpful, with little to no downside, then it's a YES for me. In my quest for research, I have found that with the mainstream media fear mongering, alongside the extreme censoring that is happening online, you'll most often find that any research published citing the positive effects of many of the nutrients and therapies listed below is quickly followed by \"experts\" and smear campaigns suggesting they don't matter to confuse the topic and public even further. Ok now that\u2019s out of the way let\u2019s jump to it. 1. VITAMIN C Vitamin C is the king of vitamins when it comes to fighting illness. We have been shouting this from the rooftops since our Food Matters film came out in 2008. But unfortunately, because it is cheap, safe, simple, effective, and cannot be patented, it means that large multinational companies don't go near it, and you'll rarely hear about it. Here's what Andrew Saul, Ph.D., has to say about high dose use of Vitamin C: \"At the proper level, vitamin C has antihistamine, antitoxin, antibiotic, antipyretic (fever-lowering) and antiviral properties.\" Add to this it's water-soluble, non-toxic, and easy to administer. There is simply no reason we couldn't include this in our protocol. Additionally, published evidence globally in China, Australia, and the US shows promise. We were taking 6-9 grams a day, and when experiencing heavy fever symptoms, we opted for the saturation approach and upped the dose to 2 grams every 15 minutes until we reached bowel tolerance. We also had extra Vitamin C via IV, listed further below. 2. ZINC Zinc is a powerful immune-supportive trace mineral. Look here if you're a non-believer. We upped our regular dose and took 50mg 3 x daily. 3. VITAMIN D Everyone is raving about Vitamin D and COVID, and I love it! Finally, it's on the radar as a powerful immune-supportive nutrient. The ever-conservative Lancet medical journal shared that Vitamin D deficient groups of the population were \"disproportionately impacted by COVID-19\" and further went on to say, \"The issue of vitamin D supplementation has been extensively debated, with strong arguments in favor and against.\" Given they admitted there are strong arguments in favor and little to no downside (except maybe for the circa $15 for a jar cost), we added this to our protocol. We took 2,000 IU 3 x daily. 4. QUERCETIN We had heard a lot about this plant flavonoid, which coincidentally was discovered by the man who also discovered Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), Nobel Prize Lauret Szent-Gyorgyi. It turns out that studies suggest that \"quercetin supplementation may promote antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunoprotective effects.\" And in relation to COVID-19, \"Quercetin displays a broad range of antiviral properties which can interfere at multiple steps of pathogen virulence -virus entry, virus replication, protein assembly- and that these therapeutic effects can be augmented by the co-administration of vitamin C. Furthermore, due to their lack of severe side effects and low-costs, we strongly suggest the combined administration of these two compounds for both the prophylaxis and the early treatment of respiratory tract infections, especially including COVID-19 patients. Again, no downside save for the cost of purchasing a bottle. We took 500mg 2 x daily. 5. DANDELION EXTRACT COVID-19 is a virus, so antiviral herbs and foods we're high on our list. We were taking a Dandelion Extract in a liquid form daily. 6. INTRAVENOUS MYERS COCKTAIL We received IV nutrients to help boost our recovery. This made it easier for us to receive a high dose of the antiviral and immune-boosting nutrients we knew our bodies needed to recover fast. Laurentine and I each had the MYERS COCKTAIL with some extra vitamin C and zinc. Here's what the experts say: \"The modified \"Myers' cocktail,\" which consists of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, has been found to be effective against acute asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue (including chronic fatigue syndrome), fibromyalgia, acute muscle spasm, upper respiratory tract infections, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, and other disorders.\" 7. CORDYCEPS Mushrooms are still not getting the attention I think they deserve. But I believe this will come over time. Cordyceps, in particular, are mighty. \"Several research groups have reported that cordycepin has antiviral activity against several viruses including influenza virus, plant viruses, human immunodeficiency virus(HIV), murine leukemia virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).\" We were taking a cordyceps blend at 600mg x 2 daily. 8. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE Hydrogen Peroxide is a cheap, safe, and effective agent in the fight against viruses. Reports show that \"H2O2 is a convenient means for virus inactivation.\" We purchased 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide from the pharmacy and gargled it daily when we brushed our teeth. We also nebulized a diluted solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide daily. We found the research compelling enough with little downside. 9. OTHER HERBS, MEDICINAL FOODS & REMEDIES We kept our anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting, and healing foods up during our infectious period, along with simple home remedies and recipes. This included hot baths, soups, garlic, ginger, turmeric, water, rest, and occasional ibuprofen when the fever, chills, or body pain became too extreme. I hope that this helps. If you have any other suggestions or points we missed, please let us know in the comments below.",

Featured image is from COVID Intel The Worldwide Corona Crisis, Global Coup d\u2019Etat Against Humanity by Michel Chossudovsky Michel Chossudovsky reviews in detail how this insidious project \u201cdestroys people\u2019s lives\u201d. He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the \u201cpandemic\u201d \u2014 from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. \u201cMy objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the \u201cdeadly\u201d COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.\u201d Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. \u2014Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky\u2019s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. \u2013Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24\/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden \u201cplandemic\u201d; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test \u2013 which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. \u2014Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that \u201cthere is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.\u201d In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. \u2013David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky\u2019s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d\u2019\u00e9tat under way called \u201cThe Great Reset\u201d that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined. Pass on this free gift from Professor Chossudovsky before it\u2019s too late. You will not find so much valuable information and analysis in one place. \u2013Edward Curtin ISBN: 978-0-9879389-3-0, Year: 2022, PDF Ebook, Pages: 164, 15 Chapters Price: $11.50 FREE COPY!

An aneurysm is an abnormal swelling or bulge in the wall of a blood vessel, such as an artery. It begins as a weak spot in the blood vessel wall, which balloons out of shape over time by the force of the pumping blood. Aneurysms can be potentially fatal if they rupture. Death can occur within minutes. About 25% of people who experience a brain aneurysm rupture die within 24 hours. Around 50% die within 3 months of the rupture due to complications. Aneurysms are a well known complication of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, that doctors are currently in denial about. Vaccine Spike protein damages blood vessels. One Japanese study looked at 3 cases of brain aneurysms that ruptured after Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. All 3 were women.

Video Interview added on November 29, 2023, Author\u2019s Note, December 5, 2023 *** Author\u2019s Message to Readers This article focussing on the alleged novel coronavirus is among the most important articles I have written. There is an element of simplicity and common sense in the text. My objective is that the article will be extensively read and debated at the grassroots of society, not only by scientists and medical doctors. The complexity of this crisis is overwhelming. This is not solely a \u201cPublic Health Crisis\u201d. The implications are far-reaching because the article refutes and invalidates \u2018everything\u201d pertaining to the Covid pandemic. These include the policies related to The Lockdown and the Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d, not to mention the infamous Pandemic Treaty and The World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGreat Reset\u201d. The official \u201ccorona narrative\u201d is predicated on a \u201cBig Lie\u201d endorsed by corrupt politicians. That \u201cofficial consensus\u201d is exceedingly fragile. Our intent is to precipitate its collapse \u201clike a house of cards\u201d. What is ultimately at stake is the value of human life and the future of humanity. Our objective is to save lives including those of newly born babies who are the victims of the Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d. At this juncture in our history, the priority is to \u201cDisable the Fear Campaign\u201d and \u201cCancel the Vaccine\u201d (including the repeal of the so-called \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d). Hopefully this will set the stage for the development of a Worldwide movement of solidarity, which questions the legitimacy of the powerful \u201cBig Money\u201d financial elites which are behind this infamous project. Dear Readers, please forward this article and the video far and wide. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, December 5, 2023 Global Research, December 5, 2023 \u201cGet off that crazy train. I know, it is scary, it can hurt. Take back your physical and intellectual autonomy and protect your children\u201d.

William Shakespeare, \u201cThe Tempest\u201d, 1623 My response to Shakespeare: \u201cSend the Devils Back to Where They Belong\u201d \u201cWhen the Lie Becomes the Truth, There Is No Moving Backwards\u201d *** Introduction Destabilizing the social, political and economic structure of 190 sovereign countries cannot constitute a \u201csolution\u201d to combating a novel coronavirus which mysteriously emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province (PRC) in late December 2019. That was the imposed \u201csolution\u201d \u2014implemented in several stages from the very outset\u2013, leading to The March 2020 Lockdown and the Rollout of a so-called Covid 19 \u201cVaccine\u201d in December 2020, which since its inception has resulted in an upward trend in excess mortality. It\u2019s the destruction of people\u2019s lives Worldwide. It is the destabilization of civil society. Fake science was supportive of this devastating agenda. The lies were sustained by a massive media disinformation campaign. 24\/7, Incessant and Repetitive \u201cCovid alerts\u201d in the course of more than three years. In turn, the ongoing fear campaign had devastating impacts on people\u2019s health. The historic March 11, 2020 lockdown triggered economic and social chaos Worldwide. It was an act of \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d: a war against humanity. The New Virus: 2019-nCoV The official story is that a dangerous NEW VIRUS was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. It was entitled 2019-nCoV which stands for \u201c2019 New (n) Corona (Co) Virus (V)\u201d. On January 1, 2020, \u201cthe Chinese health authorities closed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan following Western media reports claiming that wild animals sold there may have been the source of the virus. As of early January 2020, it was the object of extensive media coverage and an unfolding Worldwide fear campaign. Media disinformation 24\/7 went into high gear. \u201cThe Chinese authorities (allegedly) \u201cidentified a new type of virus\u201d on January 7, 2020, using the RT-PCR test. No specific details were provided regarding the process of isolation of the virus. Failed Identification of the Novel Coronavirus In late January 2020, the WHO confirmed that: It did not possess an isolate of 2019-nCoV from a purified sample from an infected patient, which meant that they were unable to confirm the identity of the novel coronavirus. February 11, 2020. The Alleged \u201cNew Virus\u201d is Renamed In early February. 2020, following the failure to identify the novel coronavirus, a decision was taken to change its name to: \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome corona virus\u201d: SARS-CoV-2 which (according to the WHO) is \u201csimilar\u201d to a 20 year old virus entitled: 2003-SARS-CoV. A Twenty Year Old 2003 Coronavirus Categorized in February 2020 as a \u201cNew Virus\u201d? Confirmed by the WHO and The New England Journal of Medicine, May 2003 (NEJM): \u201cA Novel Coronavirus Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d which broke out in China\u2019s Southern Guangdong Province in 2002 WAS identified and categorized as a \u201cnew virus\u201d on May 15, 2003. (More than 20 years ago). See Screenshot 0f NEJM May 15 2003 article below: It is not just a renaming process: the 20 year old virus 2003 SARS-CoV is the \u201cpoint of reference\u201d for everything pertaining to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic including the Lockdown and the Vaccination. (Scroll down for analysis and details pertaining to the identification and renaming of 2019-nCoV) Video: The Non-existent \u201cNew Corona Virus\u201d? Michel Chossudovsky, Interview with Caroline Mailloux, Lux Media To leave a comment or Access Rumble click here or lower right hand corner of screen \u201cBig Money\u201d and \u201cBig Pharma\u201d Meet at Davos The alleged new virus was actively debated at the World Economic Forum (WEF), meeting in Davos Switzerland (January 22, 2020). Proposed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) an entity financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a 2019-nCoV vaccine program was put forth. Announced at Davos, Seattle-based Moderna (with the support of CEPI) was to manufacture an mRNA vaccine to build immunity against 2019-nCoV. The evidence as well as the statements at Davos suggest that the 2019-nCoV vaccine project was already underway in early 2019. And CEPI had foreknowledge regarding the announcement of the 2019-nCoV. (Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter VIII). Note: The development of a 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at Davos, 2 weeks after the January 7, 2020 announcement, and barely a week prior to the official launching of the WHO\u2019s Worldwide Public Health emergency on January 30. The WEF-Gates-CEPI Vaccine Announcement precedes the WHO Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) Lies and Falsehoods All of this was unfolding at a time when the alleged new coronavirus named 2019-nC0V had not been isolated, it\u2019s identity had not been confirmed and the number of reported cases in China was exceedingly low: \u201cAs of 3 January 2020, there were 44 cases reported, 11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition (WHO Report). There was no evidence of an unfolding epidemic in China, nor was there evidence of a lab leak, CEPI\u2019s statement at Davos regarding \u201cThe Rapid Global Spread of the Novel Coronavirus\u201d is a bold face lie. (See image above) And then on January 30th, 2020, the Director General of the WHO Dr. Tedros declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with absolutely no evidence of a threatening epidemic. On that same day there were 83 positive cases Worldwide out of China for a population of 6.4 billion people. See table below: 5 positive cases in the U.S, 3 in Canada, 4 in France and 4 in Germany. Ask yourself does that constitute a Worldwide emergency? And those (cumulative) cases were based on the RT-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test which does not detect the identity of the virus. (See Appendix). Screenshot from WHO, January 29, 2020. Number of confirmed positive cases in US, Canada, France and Germany Three weeks later at a press conference on the 20th of February 2020 the WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus intimated that the pandemic was imminent: \u201c[I am] concerned that the chance to contain the coronavirus outbreak was \u201cclosing\u201d \u2026 \u201cI believe the window of opportunity is still there, but that the window is narrowing.\u201d What was the evidence put forth by Dr. Tedros in support of his bold statement? On February 20, 2020, there were only 1076 confirmed cases outside China (including those of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship stranded in Japan\u2019s territorial waters). On that same day, the WHO provided the data of confirmed cases \u201cby countries, territories or areas outside China\u201d: 15 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, 16 in Germany, 12 in France, 9 in the U.K. March 11, 2020: The historic COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, \u201cClosing Down\u201d of approximately 190 National Economies The WHO Director-General had already set the stage in his February 21st Press Conference. \u201cThe world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The WHO officially declared a worldwide pandemic at a time when there were 44,279 (cumulative) positive Covid cases outside China for a population of 6.4 billion. (For details and analysis see Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter II) Confirmed by the WHO, in the United States, recorded on March 9, 2020, there were 3,457 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d (RT-PCR positive) out of a population of 329.5 million people (Screenshot of WHO graph Interactive WHO graph) In Canada on March 9, 2020, there were 125 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d out of a population of 38.5 million people Screenshot of WHO graph Interactive WHO graph. Data for Canada In Germany on March 9, 2020, there were 2948 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d out of a population of 83.2 million people For details, see Michel Chossudovsky, March 19, 2022) The October 2019 \u201cEvent 201\u201d Simulation of a \u201cDangerous Virus\u201d entitled nCoV-2019 Event 201 was a table top simulation of a coronavirus epidemic, sponsored by John Hopkins and the Gates Foundation. The WHO initially adopted the same acronym, namely 2019-nCoV (to designate the novel coronavirus), as that of the Johns Hopkins simulated Pandemic Event 201 Exercise. The name of the new coronavirus was (with the exception of the placement of 2019) identical to that of the Event 201 simulation. Attended by prominent personalities, The Simulation was held on October 18, 2019, less than three months before the announcement in early January 2020 of a new coronavirus. Among the participants, were representatives (aka. decision-makers) from the WHO, US Intelligence, the Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) (financed by the Gates Foundation), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the United Nations, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Director Dr. George Fu Gao), Big Pharma, the World Bank, among others. These various organizations played a key role when the so-called pandemic went live in early 2020. Many features of the 201 \u201csimulation exercise\u201d did in fact correspond to what actually happened when the WHO Director-General launched a Global Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. . Moreover, the sponsors of Event 201 \u2014 including the WEF and the Gates Foundation \u2014 as well the participants were actively involved from the very outset in coordinating (and financing) COVID-19-related policies including the RT-PCR test, the March 2020 lockdown as well as as the mRNA vaccine, launched in December 2020 China\u2019s CDC Director Dr. George Fu Gao \u2013who participated in the 201 simulation\u2013 played a central role in overseeing the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020, acting in close liaison with his mentor Dr. Anthony Fauci, as well as with the Gates Foundation, CEPI, et al. Dr. Gao Fu is an Oxford graduate with links to Big Pharma. He was also for several years a fellow of the Wellcome Charitable Foundation owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, plc). The Mysterious \u201cIdentity of the New Virus\u201d The name of the virus was first identified: \u2013October 2020: 201 Simulation Scenario October 2020: nCoV-2019 \u2013December 2019, Wuhan: 2019 nCoV And then mysteriously another change in the name of the novel coronavirus took place on February 11, 2020. from 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2, which stands for \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d: SARS \u2013 Corona (Co) Virus(V)-2\u2033. There was no longer a \u201cn\u201d prefix (indicating that it was a NEW VIRUS). The \u201cn\u201d prefix was replaced by a \u201c2\u201d suffix What is the meaning of SARS-CoV-2. More specifically what is the meaning of the mysterious \u201c2\u201d suffix? It pertains to a 20 year old virus entitled: 2003 -SARS-CoV, which can by no means be categorized as a NEW VIRUS \u201cNew Virus\u201d versus \u201cOld Virus\u201d: the 2002-2003 \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS) SARS-CoV-2 \u2013which since February 11, 2020 had become the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus\u2013 is by no means A NEW VIRUS. Flash Back to China, Guangdong Province 2002-2003. Confirmed by the WHO and peer reviewed reports: \u201cA Novel Coronavirus Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d broke out in Guangdong, Province, PRC in 2002. (NEJM, May 2003) SARS was categorized as Novel Coronavirus in 2003. i.e no longer NEW. It was detected and isolated 20 years ago in early 2003. In the course of the last twenty years it must have resulted in multiple variants of the original 2003-SARS-Coronavirus. The Essential Features of the 2003-SARS-CoV Virus Confirmed by the WHO \u201cthe Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a SARS-associated coronavirus. It was first identified at the end of February 2003 [more than 20 years ago] during an outbreak that emerged in China and spread to 4 other countries. \u2026 A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. \u2026 a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. \u2026 Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. What is significant in this report is that the WHO confirmed that the novel 2003 coronavirus entitled 2003 SARS-CoV had been isolated from patients\u2019 samples, identified and designated \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d in March 2003. Absence of An Isolate of the \u201cNew 2019 Virus (2019-nCoV)\u201d While the 2003 SARS-CoV was duly isolated, the WHO acknowledged in January 2020 that it did not have an isolate and purified sample of the new 2019 coronavirus from an infected patient, which meant that they were unable to confirm the identity of the (\u201cdangerous\u201d) 2019 novel coronavirus entitled 2019-nCoV. That was the reason given. Sounds Absurd. How was this matter resolved. Following advice from the Gates Foundation, the WHO was in liaison with the Berlin Virology Institute at Charit\u00e9 Hospital. Under the scientific guidance of Dr. Christian Drosten, the Berlin Virology study was entitled: The Berlin Virology Institute study firmly acknowledged that: [While]\u2026 several viral genome sequences had been released,\u2026 virus isolates or samples [of 2019-nCoV] from infected patients were not available \u2026\u201d What the Berlin team recommended to the WHO was that in the absence of an isolate of the 2019-nCoV virus, a similar 2003 SARS-CoV virus should be used as a \u201cproxy\u201d (point of reference) of the novel 2019 coronavirus: \u201cThe genome sequences suggest presence of a virus closely related to the members of a viral species termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV, a species defined by the agent of the 2002\/03 outbreak of SARS in humans [3,4]. We report on the the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV screening and specific confirmation [using the RT-PCR test], designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.\u201d (Eurosurveillance, January 23, 2020, emphasis added). What this ambiguous statement suggests is that the identity of 2019-nCoV was not required and that \u201cCOVID-19 confirmed cases\u201d (aka infection resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus) would be validated by \u201cthe close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV.\u201d How could the new virus be categorized as similar without having been identified, i.e. without an \u201cisolate\u201d? Moreover, bear in mind that while the PCR test does not detect the virus, it detects genetic fragments (of numerous viruses). Smoking Gun What this means is that a coronavirus detected 20 years ago (at the time of writing) in Guangdong Province (2003 SARS-CoV) has been used to \u201cvalidate\u201d the identity of a so-called \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d first detected in China\u2019s Hubei Province in late December 2019. The recommendations of the Drosten study (financed with a grant of $249,550 from the Gates Foundation) were then transmitted to the WHO. They were subsequently endorsed by the Director- General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO did not have in its possession the \u201cvirus isolate\u201d required to identify the new virus. \u201cNever mind\u201d. It was decided that an isolate of the new coronavirus was not required. It stands to reason that if the PCR test uses the 2003 SARS-CoV virus as a proxy or \u201cpoint of reference\u201d, there can be no \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases pertaining to the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The 2019 new coronavirus 2019 nCoV was renamed SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. That explains the 2 suffix. The 2019 novel coronavirus is said to be \u201csimilar\u201d to 2003-SARS-CoV, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-1 (to distinguish it from SARS-CoV-2). The NEW Virus (2019 nCoV) is \u201cnon-existent\u201d (no RT-PCR confirmed cases). The RT-PCR Test Declared Invalid by the WHO Amply documented, the RT-PCR test detects genetic fragments of numerous viruses without being able to identify the virus. See the article below: The WHO Confirms that the Covid-19 PCR Test is Flawed: Estimates of \u201cPositive Cases\u201d are Meaningless. The Lockdown Has No Scientific Basis By Prof Michel Chossudovsky, December 10, 2023 See also our review of the RT- PCR in the Appendix of this article. The significance and ambiguity of the WHO decision \u2013following the advice of the Berlin Virology Institute\u2013 namely the issue of the \u201cisolate\u201d of the novel coronavirus have been casually overlooked. \u201cNo Questions Asked\u201d The British Media reported on February 6, 2020 the change in the name of the virus: \u201c[The] Deadly coronavirus will FINALLY get a name: Scientists plan to officially label the disease \u2018within days\u2019 \u2013 but it won\u2019t be called after any places or animals. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has submitted a name. \u2026 Big Money, Big Pharma. Patent Rights Let\u2019s bear in mind: The Covid Crisis which is still ongoing is a Big Money Operation Worldwide, with numerous Big Pharma products, extending from the global misuse of the RT-PCR test, to the multibillion dollar Big Pharma vaccine project, largely dominated by Pfizer. Was the change in the name of the virus to SARS-CoV-2 an issue of \u201croyalties\u201d and intellectual property rights? The U.S Patent Rights, pertaining to 2003 SARS-CoV was filed in April 2004 and assigned in May 2007 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Patent No.: US 7,220,852 B1 Date of Patent: May 22 2007. (This is a matter for further investigation.) \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d and the \u201cNon-Existent New Virus\u201d. What are the Consequences? As documented above (confirmed by the WHO) the new 2019 corona virus was never identified. The use of a 20 year old virus entitled 2003 SARS-CoV as a proxy for the alleged new virus confirms that there was NO PANDEMIC resulting from a NEW CORONAVIRUS in January-March 2020. THERE WAS NO \u201cNEW VIRUS\u201d. What this signifies is that both the Devastating Lockdown policies imposed on 190 countries (March 11, 2020) as well the Worldwide Rollout of the Covid-19 Vaccine (mid December 2020) are fraudulent. They are based on a \u201cBig Lie\u201d, which has contributed in the course of almost four years to literally destroying people\u2019s lives. In turn the incessant fear campaign had a devastating impact on people\u2019s health, their mental health, including a Worldwide wave of suicides. In several countries suicides among school children were recorded (See Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter VI) \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d Precipitates the Lockdown The unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus has provided a pretext and a justification to powerful financial interests and corrupt politicians to precipitate the entire world into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair. The lockdown was an act of economic and social warfare. The labor force was confined, the work place is frozen, leading to an engineered Worldwide economic collapse. This crisis is by no means over. The entire World is currently strangled in the Most Serious Debt Crisis is World history. All categories of indebtedness (private and public). In the words of the WEF billionaires to those who are loosing their homes or cannot pay their monthly rent: their motto is: \u201cOwn Nothing Be Happy\u201d. The mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d Intended to Protect People against a \u201cNon Existent New Virus\u201d Amply documented the mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d which was intended to protect people against this non-existent new coronavirus renamed SARS-nCoV-2 has resulted in an upward trend in excess mortality. The Pfizer Confidential Report released under Freedom of Information confirms based on their own data that the vaccine is a toxic substance. To access the complete Pfizer report click here The evidence is overwhelming: See the carefully documented impacts of the \u201cvaccine\u201d by Dr. William Makis on people from all walks life: pilots, health workers, school children, students, athletes, pregnant women and new born babies (and many more). Excess Mortality There are numerous studies on vaccine related excess mortality. Below is a summary of an incisive study pertaining to Cancer Related Excess Mortality in England and Wales resulting from the mRNA Vaccine conducted by the team of Edward Dowd Dowd\u2019s method was to analyze the number of deaths attributed to cancer in England and Wales between 2010 and 2022 (based on the data of the U.K. Office for National Statistics). The table below pertains to excess deaths related to malignant neoplasm (cancerous tumor) in England and Wales, recorded in three consecutive years: 2020, 2021, and 2022 vs. a 10 year trend (2010-2019). The data for excess mortality in 2020 (the year prior to the vaccine) are negative with the exception of \u201cmalignant neoplasm without specification of site\u201d. The COVID-19 vaccine was rolled-out in several phases in England and Wales starting on December 8, 2020 and extending into March-April 2021. The upward movement in excess mortality (%) commences in 2021. The increase in excess mortality related to malignant neoplasm is tabulated for the two first years of the vaccine. Below is a similar table pertaining to Excess Mortality in Germany, which points to the Deviation of Observed Mortality from Expected Mortality (by age group) in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Notice the upward shift in excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 following the rollout of the Covid Vaccine in December 2020 Germany: Excess Mortality by Age Group (%) Excess Mortality in Red by age group, Total Excess Mortality in Gray Media Disinformation, Boldface Lies There are numerous studies on excess mortality resulting from the vaccine, which are ignored by the media. Invariably the Press reports state with authority that it is the virus which is \u201cdangerous\u201dor \u201cdeadly\u201d, when in fact it is the \u201cVaccine\u201d which has triggered an upward trend in mortality. The Daily Mail (February 6, 2020) refers to a \u201cdeadly coronavirus\u201d intimating that it is spreading Worldwide The dangerous virus designation is a boldface LIE: Confirmed by the WHO, the CDC and peer reviewed reports, the 2019 nCoV-19 is not dangerous. See the Appendix below. \u201cWhen the Lie Become the Truth, There is No Moving Backwards\u201d CENSORSHIP: The original Global Research video produced by Ariel Rodriguez in February 2021 was taken down by Vimeo on March 5, 2022 Below is the Version on Rumble *** Our thanks to Vaccine Choice Canada Our analysis in this short article has provided evidence: that the alleged NEW CORONAVIRUS entitled 2019 nCoV was never isolated, the renamed new coronavirus entitled SARS-CoV-2 is NOT A NEW VIRUS. It is similar to an OLD VIRUS entitled 2003-SARS-CoV. I should mention that there are many other issues which invalidate the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d, specifically the RT-PCR test which does not identify the virus.

Appendix Our analysis above provides evidence: that the alleged NEW CORONAVIRUS entitled 2019 nCoV was never isolated and that the renamed new coronavirus entitled SARS-CoV-2 is similar to a 20 year old virus entitled 2003-SARS-CoV It should be understood that there are many other issues which invalidate the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d which are not addressed in the article(See sections 1, 2, 3 4 below as well as our review of The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test Of significance to our understanding of \u201cfear campaigns\u201d, the WHO and CDC confirm that the 2019 nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) is not a dangerous virus. 1. The WHO Statement Regarding 2019-nCoV The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. \u2026 These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\u201d (For further details see Michel Chossudovsky, August 2022, emphasis added) 2. Dr. Anthony Fauci Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in the NEJM From the outset, Fauci has persistently warned of the imminent dangers of the SARS-CoV-2 (including its variants and sub-variants), while acknowledging in his peer reviewed article in the New England Journal of Medicine (together with H. Clifford Lane, M.D. and Robert R. Redfield, M.D. that: \u201cThe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968)\u2026\u201d (See Covid-19 \u2014 Navigating the Uncharted, NEJM) 3. The WHO\u2019s Definition of 2003-SARS SARS is an airborne virus and can spread through small droplets of saliva in a similar way to the cold and influenza. \u2026 SARS can also be spread indirectly via surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus. Most patients identified with SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25\u201370 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition for probable and suspected cases of SARS is around 3%. One month prior to the change of name of the novel 2019 nCoV coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 (On February 11), the WHO released, a detailed document pertaining to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Operational Support & Logistics Disease Commodity Packages pdf). 4. The CDC\u2019s Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with Seasonal Influenza \u201cInfluenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.\u201d",

First published on December 4, 2022 *** Medical Doctors for Covid Ethics International (MD4CE International) is grateful to His Excellency, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, for speaking to us and sharing his thoughts on the current global crisis, which began with the fraudulent concocted Covid-19 pandemic emergency, supported by and maintained by an evil military grade psychological operation, complete with the unashamed use of fear and shame propaganda, which was unleashed in a coordinated manner on the unsuspecting people of the entire world by their own governments in early 2020, with predictably cataclysmic results. MD4CE International is an international group of medical doctors, scientists, lawyers, journalists, economists, historians, politicians, philosophers, data analysts, bankers, military\/intelligence experts and others from all over the world, working determinedly together to expose the terrible truth of what has happened during the past three years to the people of the world, their families, their communities, their countries, and to hold those responsible for the great crimes committed properly to account. His Excellency Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano is the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America (19 October 2011 to 12 April 2016). Dr. Stephen Frost *** Below is Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2\u2019s address to Medical Doctors for Covid Ethics International (MD4CE International). Dear and distinguished friends, Allow me first of all to thank Dr. Stephen Frost for the invitation he has extended to me to speak to you. Along with Dr. Frost I also thank all of you: your commitment to fighting the psychopandemic propaganda is commendable. I am well aware of the difficulties you have had to face in order to remain consistent with your principles, and I hope that the damage you have suffered can be adequately repaired by those who have discriminated against you, depriving you of work and salary and labeling you as dangerous no-vaxxers. I am pleased to be able to speak and share with you my thoughts about the current global crisis. A crisis that we can consider to have begun with the pandemic emergency, but that we know has been planned for decades with very specific purposes by well-known personalities. Stopping at the pandemic alone would in fact be a serious mistake, because it would not allow us to consider the events in their full coherence and inter-connectedness, thus preventing us from understanding them and above all from identifying the criminal intentions behind them. You too \u2013 each with your own expertise in the medical, scientific, legal or other fields \u2013 will agree with me that limiting yourselves to your own discipline, which in some cases is extremely specific, does not fully explain the rationale for certain choices that have been made by governments, international bodies, and pharmaceutical agencies. For example, finding \u201cgraphene-like\u201d material in the blood of people who have been inoculated with experimental serums makes no sense for a virologist, but it does made sense for an expert in nanomaterials and nanotechnology who understands what graphene can be used for. It also makes sense for an expert in medical patents, who immediately identifies the content of the invention and relates it to other similar patents. It also makes sense for an expert in war technologies who knows about studies on the enhanced man (a document of the British Ministry of Defense calls him \u201caugmented man\u201d in transhumanistic terms) and is therefore able to recognize in graphene nanostructures the technology that enables the augmentation of the war performance of military personnel. And a telemedicine expert will be able to recognize in those nanostructures the indispensable device that sends biomedical parameters to the patient control server and also receives certain signals from it. Once again: the assessment of events from a medical point of view should take into account the legal implications of certain choices, such as the imposition of masks or, even worse, mass \u201cvaccination,\u201d made in violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. And I am sure that in the field of health governance the manipulations of the classification codes of diseases and therapies will also emerge, which have been designed to make the harmful effects of measures taken against COVID-19 untraceable, from placing people on respirators in intensive care to watchful waiting protocols, to say nothing of the scandalous violations of regulations by the European Commission which \u2013 as you know \u2013 has no delegation from the European Parliament in the field of Health, and that is not a public institution but rather a private business consortium. Just in the past few days, at the G-20 Bali summit, Klaus Schwab instructed heads of government \u2013 almost all coming from the Young Global Leaders for Tomorrow program of the World Economic Forum \u2013 about the future steps to be taken in view of establishing a world government. The president of a very powerful private organization with enormous economic means exercises undue power over world governments, obtaining their obedience from political leaders who have no popular mandate to subject their nations to the delusions of power of the elite: this fact is of unprecedented gravity. Klaus Schwab said: \u201cIn the fourth industrial revolution the winners will take it all, so if you are a World Economic Forum first mover, you are the winners\u201d (here). These very serious statements have two implications: the first is that \u201cthe winners will take it all\u201d and will be \u201cwinners\u201d \u2013 it is not clear in what capacity and with whose permission. The second is that those who do not adapt to this \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d will find themselves ousted and will lose \u2013 they will lose everything, including their freedom. In short, Klaus Schwab is threatening the heads of government of the twenty most industrialized nations in the world to carry out the programmatic points of the Great Reset in their nations. This goes far beyond the pandemic: it is a global coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, against which it is essential that people rise up and that the still healthy organs of states start an international juridical process. The threat is imminent and serious, since the World Economic Forum is capable of carrying out its subversive project and those who govern nations have all become either enslaved or blackmailed by this international mafia. In light of these statements \u2013 and those of others no less delusional than Yuval Noah Harari, Schwab\u2019s adviser \u2013 we understand how the pandemic farce served as a trial balloon for imposing controls, coercive measures, curtailing individual freedoms, and increasing unemployment and poverty. The next steps will have to be carried out by means of economic and energy crises, which are instrumental to the establishment of a synarchic government in the hands of the globalist elite. And here, dear friends, allow me to speak as a bishop. Because in this series of events that we are witnessing and will continue to witness, your commitment could risk being thwarted or limited by the fact of not being able to see its essentially spiritual nature. I know that two centuries of Enlightenment thought, revolutions, atheistic materialism and anticlerical liberalism have accustomed us to thinking of Faith as a personal matter, or that there is not an objective Truth to which we all must conform. But this is the fruit of a propaedeutic indoctrination, one that happened long before what is happening today, and it would be foolish to believe that the anti-Christian ideology that drove the secret sects and Masonic groups of the eighteenth century had nothing to do with the anti-Christian ideology that today drives people like Klaus Schwab, George Soros, and Bill Gates. The driving principles are the same: rebellion against God, hatred for the Church and humanity, and destructive fury aimed against Creation and especially against man because he is created in the image and likeness of God. If you start from this evidence, you will understand that it is not possible to pretend that what is happening before our eyes is solely the result of profit-seeking or the desire for power. Certainly, the economic part cannot be disregarded, considering how many people have collaborated with the World Economic Forum. And yet, beyond profit, there are unstated purposes that stem from a \u201ctheological\u201d vision \u2013 one that is turned upside-down, it\u2019s true, but still theological \u2013 a vision that sees two opposing sides: the side of Christ and the side of the Antichrist. There can be no neutrality, because when there is a clash between two armies, those who choose not to fight are also making a choice that affects the outcome of the battle. On the other hand, how is it possible to recognize in your noble and high professions the admirable order that the Creator has placed in nature (from the constellations of stars to the particles of the atom) and then deny that man is also part of this order, with his moral sense, his laws, his culture, and his discoveries? How can man, who is God\u2019s creature, presume to not be subject himself to eternal and perfect laws? Our battle is not against creatures made of flesh and blood, but against the Principalities and Powers, against the rulers of this world of darkness, against the spirits of evil that dwell in the heavenly places (Eph 6:12). On the other front, we must recognize that the City of God is more difficult to identify. Even the religious authorities appear to have betrayed their role of giving guidance to the faithful, preferring to serve power and propagate their lies. The very people who ought to be protecting and sanctifying souls are scattering and scandalizing them, calling good Christians rigid fundamentalists. As you can see, the attack is on several fronts, and thus it is a mortal threat for humanity, striking at both the body and the soul. And yet, precisely at a time when it is difficult to find authoritative points of reference \u2013 both in the religious sphere as well as the temporal one \u2013 we see an ever-increasing number of those who are understanding, opening their eyes, and recognizing the criminal mind behind the evolution of events. It is now clear that everything is linked together, without having to dismiss those who say so as \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d The conspiracy is already there: we are not inventing it, we are simply denouncing it, hoping that people wake up from this suicidal narcosis and demand that someone put an end to the global coup. The operations of social engineering and mass manipulation have demonstrated beyond any doubt that this crime was premeditated, and how it is consistent with a \u201cspiritual\u201d vision of the conflict that is now unfolding: it is necessary to take sides and fight, without giving in. The Truth \u2013 which is an attribute of God \u2013 cannot be cancelled by error, and Life cannot be defeated by death: remember that the Lord, who has said of Himself, \u201cI am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,\u201d has already defeated Satan, and what remains of the battle serves only to give us the opportunity to make the right choice, to choose to do those actions which place us under the banner of Christ, on the side of Good. I trust that this great work you are undertaking will soon bear its expected fruits, putting an end to a time of trial in which we see how the world will become if we do not turn to Christ, if we continue to think that we can coexist with evil, lying, and self-worship. After all, the City of God is the model of those who live in God\u2019s love, self-control, and contempt for the world; the city of the devil is the model of those who live in self-love, conforming to the world and despising God. I thank you and bless you all. + Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, Archbishop *** Biography of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 was born on January 16, 1941 in Varese, Italy.

Video Interview added on November 29, 2023, Author\u2019s Note, December 5, 2023 *** Author\u2019s Message to Readers This article focussing on the alleged novel coronavirus is among the most important articles I have written. There is an element of simplicity and common sense in the text. My objective is that the article will be extensively read and debated at the grassroots of society, not only by scientists and medical doctors. The complexity of this crisis is overwhelming. This is not solely a \u201cPublic Health Crisis\u201d. The implications are far-reaching because the article refutes and invalidates \u2018everything\u201d pertaining to the Covid pandemic. These include the policies related to The Lockdown and the Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d, not to mention the infamous Pandemic Treaty and The World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGreat Reset\u201d. The official \u201ccorona narrative\u201d is predicated on a \u201cBig Lie\u201d endorsed by corrupt politicians. That \u201cofficial consensus\u201d is exceedingly fragile. Our intent is to precipitate its collapse \u201clike a house of cards\u201d. What is ultimately at stake is the value of human life and the future of humanity. Our objective is to save lives including those of newly born babies who are the victims of the Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d. At this juncture in our history, the priority is to \u201cDisable the Fear Campaign\u201d and \u201cCancel the Vaccine\u201d (including the repeal of the so-called \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d). Hopefully this will set the stage for the development of a Worldwide movement of solidarity, which questions the legitimacy of the powerful \u201cBig Money\u201d financial elites which are behind this infamous project. Dear Readers, please forward this article and the video far and wide. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, December 5, 2023 Global Research, December 5, 2023 \u201cGet off that crazy train.

That was the imposed \u201csolution\u201d \u2014implemented in several stages from the very outset\u2013, leading to The March 2020 Lockdown and the Rollout of a so-called Covid 19 \u201cVaccine\u201d in December 2020, which since its inception has resulted in an upward trend in excess mortality. It\u2019s the destruction of people\u2019s lives Worldwide. It is the destabilization of civil society. Fake science was supportive of this devastating agenda. The lies were sustained by a massive media disinformation campaign. 24\/7, Incessant and Repetitive \u201cCovid alerts\u201d in the course of more than three years. In turn, the ongoing fear campaign had devastating impacts on people\u2019s health. The historic March 11, 2020 lockdown triggered economic and social chaos Worldwide. It was an act of \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d: a war against humanity. The New Virus: 2019-nCoV The official story is that a dangerous NEW VIRUS was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. It was entitled 2019-nCoV which stands for \u201c2019 New (n) Corona (Co) Virus (V)\u201d. On January 1, 2020, \u201cthe Chinese health authorities closed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan following Western media reports claiming that wild animals sold there may have been the source of the virus. As of early January 2020, it was the object of extensive media coverage and an unfolding Worldwide fear campaign. Media disinformation 24\/7 went into high gear. \u201cThe Chinese authorities (allegedly) \u201cidentified a new type of virus\u201d on January 7, 2020, using the RT-PCR test. No specific details were provided regarding the process of isolation of the virus. Failed Identification of the Novel Coronavirus In late January 2020, the WHO confirmed that: It did not possess an isolate of 2019-nCoV from a purified sample from an infected patient, which meant that they were unable to confirm the identity of the novel coronavirus. February 11, 2020. The Alleged \u201cNew Virus\u201d is Renamed In early February. 2020, following the failure to identify the novel coronavirus, a decision was taken to change its name to: \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome corona virus\u201d: SARS-CoV-2 which (according to the WHO) is \u201csimilar\u201d to a 20 year old virus entitled: 2003-SARS-CoV. A Twenty Year Old 2003 Coronavirus Categorized in February 2020 as a \u201cNew Virus\u201d? Confirmed by the WHO and The New England Journal of Medicine, May 2003 (NEJM): \u201cA Novel Coronavirus Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d which broke out in China\u2019s Southern Guangdong Province in 2002 WAS identified and categorized as a \u201cnew virus\u201d on May 15, 2003. (More than 20 years ago). See Screenshot 0f NEJM May 15 2003 article below: It is not just a renaming process: the 20 year old virus 2003 SARS-CoV is the \u201cpoint of reference\u201d for everything pertaining to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic including the Lockdown and the Vaccination. (Scroll down for analysis and details pertaining to the identification and renaming of 2019-nCoV) Video: The Non-existent \u201cNew Corona Virus\u201d? Michel Chossudovsky, Interview with Caroline Mailloux, Lux Media To leave a comment or Access Rumble click here or lower right hand corner of screen \u201cBig Money\u201d and \u201cBig Pharma\u201d Meet at Davos The alleged new virus was actively debated at the World Economic Forum (WEF), meeting in Davos Switzerland (January 22, 2020). Proposed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) an entity financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a 2019-nCoV vaccine program was put forth. Announced at Davos, Seattle-based Moderna (with the support of CEPI) was to manufacture an mRNA vaccine to build immunity against 2019-nCoV. The evidence as well as the statements at Davos suggest that the 2019-nCoV vaccine project was already underway in early 2019. And CEPI had foreknowledge regarding the announcement of the 2019-nCoV. (Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter VIII). Note: The development of a 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at Davos, 2 weeks after the January 7, 2020 announcement, and barely a week prior to the official launching of the WHO\u2019s Worldwide Public Health emergency on January 30. The WEF-Gates-CEPI Vaccine Announcement precedes the WHO Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) Lies and Falsehoods All of this was unfolding at a time when the alleged new coronavirus named 2019-nC0V had not been isolated, it\u2019s identity had not been confirmed and the number of reported cases in China was exceedingly low: \u201cAs of 3 January 2020, there were 44 cases reported, 11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition (WHO Report). There was no evidence of an unfolding epidemic in China, nor was there evidence of a lab leak, CEPI\u2019s statement at Davos regarding \u201cThe Rapid Global Spread of the Novel Coronavirus\u201d is a bold face lie. (See image above) And then on January 30th, 2020, the Director General of the WHO Dr. Tedros declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with absolutely no evidence of a threatening epidemic. On that same day there were 83 positive cases Worldwide out of China for a population of 6.4 billion people. See table below: 5 positive cases in the U.S, 3 in Canada, 4 in France and 4 in Germany. Ask yourself does that constitute a Worldwide emergency? And those (cumulative) cases were based on the RT-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test which does not detect the identity of the virus. (See Appendix). Screenshot from WHO, January 29, 2020. Number of confirmed positive cases in US, Canada, France and Germany Three weeks later at a press conference on the 20th of February 2020 the WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus intimated that the pandemic was imminent: \u201c[I am] concerned that the chance to contain the coronavirus outbreak was \u201cclosing\u201d \u2026 \u201cI believe the window of opportunity is still there, but that the window is narrowing.\u201d What was the evidence put forth by Dr. Tedros in support of his bold statement? On February 20, 2020, there were only 1076 confirmed cases outside China (including those of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship stranded in Japan\u2019s territorial waters). On that same day, the WHO provided the data of confirmed cases \u201cby countries, territories or areas outside China\u201d: 15 in the U.S., 8 in Canada, 16 in Germany, 12 in France, 9 in the U.K. March 11, 2020: The historic COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, \u201cClosing Down\u201d of approximately 190 National Economies The WHO Director-General had already set the stage in his February 21st Press Conference. \u201cThe world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The WHO officially declared a worldwide pandemic at a time when there were 44,279 (cumulative) positive Covid cases outside China for a population of 6.4 billion. (For details and analysis see Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter II) Confirmed by the WHO, in the United States, recorded on March 9, 2020, there were 3,457 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d (RT-PCR positive) out of a population of 329.5 million people (Screenshot of WHO graph Interactive WHO graph) In Canada on March 9, 2020, there were 125 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d out of a population of 38.5 million people Screenshot of WHO graph Interactive WHO graph. Data for Canada In Germany on March 9, 2020, there were 2948 \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d out of a population of 83.2 million people For details, see Michel Chossudovsky, March 19, 2022) The October 2019 \u201cEvent 201\u201d Simulation of a \u201cDangerous Virus\u201d entitled nCoV-2019 Event 201 was a table top simulation of a coronavirus epidemic, sponsored by John Hopkins and the Gates Foundation. The WHO initially adopted the same acronym, namely 2019-nCoV (to designate the novel coronavirus), as that of the Johns Hopkins simulated Pandemic Event 201 Exercise. The name of the new coronavirus was (with the exception of the placement of 2019) identical to that of the Event 201 simulation. Attended by prominent personalities, The Simulation was held on October 18, 2019, less than three months before the announcement in early January 2020 of a new coronavirus. Among the participants, were representatives (aka. decision-makers) from the WHO, US Intelligence, the Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) (financed by the Gates Foundation), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the United Nations, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Director Dr. George Fu Gao), Big Pharma, the World Bank, among others. These various organizations played a key role when the so-called pandemic went live in early 2020. Many features of the 201 \u201csimulation exercise\u201d did in fact correspond to what actually happened when the WHO Director-General launched a Global Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. . Moreover, the sponsors of Event 201 \u2014 including the WEF and the Gates Foundation \u2014 as well the participants were actively involved from the very outset in coordinating (and financing) COVID-19-related policies including the RT-PCR test, the March 2020 lockdown as well as as the mRNA vaccine, launched in December 2020 China\u2019s CDC Director Dr. George Fu Gao \u2013who participated in the 201 simulation\u2013 played a central role in overseeing the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020, acting in close liaison with his mentor Dr. Anthony Fauci, as well as with the Gates Foundation, CEPI, et al. Dr. Gao Fu is an Oxford graduate with links to Big Pharma. He was also for several years a fellow of the Wellcome Charitable Foundation owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, plc). The Mysterious \u201cIdentity of the New Virus\u201d The name of the virus was first identified: \u2013October 2020: 201 Simulation Scenario October 2020: nCoV-2019 \u2013December 2019, Wuhan: 2019 nCoV And then mysteriously another change in the name of the novel coronavirus took place on February 11, 2020. from 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2, which stands for \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d: SARS \u2013 Corona (Co) Virus(V)-2\u2033. There was no longer a \u201cn\u201d prefix (indicating that it was a NEW VIRUS). The \u201cn\u201d prefix was replaced by a \u201c2\u201d suffix What is the meaning of SARS-CoV-2. More specifically what is the meaning of the mysterious \u201c2\u201d suffix? It pertains to a 20 year old virus entitled: 2003 -SARS-CoV, which can by no means be categorized as a NEW VIRUS \u201cNew Virus\u201d versus \u201cOld Virus\u201d: the 2002-2003 \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS) SARS-CoV-2 \u2013which since February 11, 2020 had become the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus\u2013 is by no means A NEW VIRUS. Flash Back to China, Guangdong Province 2002-2003. Confirmed by the WHO and peer reviewed reports: \u201cA Novel Coronavirus Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d broke out in Guangdong, Province, PRC in 2002. (NEJM, May 2003) SARS was categorized as Novel Coronavirus in 2003. i.e no longer NEW. It was detected and isolated 20 years ago in early 2003. In the course of the last twenty years it must have resulted in multiple variants of the original 2003-SARS-Coronavirus. The Essential Features of the 2003-SARS-CoV Virus Confirmed by the WHO \u201cthe Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a SARS-associated coronavirus. It was first identified at the end of February 2003 [more than 20 years ago] during an outbreak that emerged in China and spread to 4 other countries. \u2026 A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. \u2026 a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. \u2026 Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. What is significant in this report is that the WHO confirmed that the novel 2003 coronavirus entitled 2003 SARS-CoV had been isolated from patients\u2019 samples, identified and designated \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d in March 2003. Absence of An Isolate of the \u201cNew 2019 Virus (2019-nCoV)\u201d While the 2003 SARS-CoV was duly isolated, the WHO acknowledged in January 2020 that it did not have an isolate and purified sample of the new 2019 coronavirus from an infected patient, which meant that they were unable to confirm the identity of the (\u201cdangerous\u201d) 2019 novel coronavirus entitled 2019-nCoV. That was the reason given. Sounds Absurd. How was this matter resolved. Following advice from the Gates Foundation, the WHO was in liaison with the Berlin Virology Institute at Charit\u00e9 Hospital. Under the scientific guidance of Dr. Christian Drosten, the Berlin Virology study was entitled: The Berlin Virology Institute study firmly acknowledged that: [While]\u2026 several viral genome sequences had been released,\u2026 virus isolates or samples [of 2019-nCoV] from infected patients were not available \u2026\u201d What the Berlin team recommended to the WHO was that in the absence of an isolate of the 2019-nCoV virus, a similar 2003 SARS-CoV virus should be used as a \u201cproxy\u201d (point of reference) of the novel 2019 coronavirus: \u201cThe genome sequences suggest presence of a virus closely related to the members of a viral species termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV, a species defined by the agent of the 2002\/03 outbreak of SARS in humans [3,4]. We report on the the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV screening and specific confirmation [using the RT-PCR test], designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.\u201d (Eurosurveillance, January 23, 2020, emphasis added). What this ambiguous statement suggests is that the identity of 2019-nCoV was not required and that \u201cCOVID-19 confirmed cases\u201d (aka infection resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus) would be validated by \u201cthe close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV.\u201d How could the new virus be categorized as similar without having been identified, i.e. without an \u201cisolate\u201d? Moreover, bear in mind that while the PCR test does not detect the virus, it detects genetic fragments (of numerous viruses). Smoking Gun What this means is that a coronavirus detected 20 years ago (at the time of writing) in Guangdong Province (2003 SARS-CoV) has been used to \u201cvalidate\u201d the identity of a so-called \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d first detected in China\u2019s Hubei Province in late December 2019. The recommendations of the Drosten study (financed with a grant of $249,550 from the Gates Foundation) were then transmitted to the WHO. They were subsequently endorsed by the Director- General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO did not have in its possession the \u201cvirus isolate\u201d required to identify the new virus. \u201cNever mind\u201d. It was decided that an isolate of the new coronavirus was not required. It stands to reason that if the PCR test uses the 2003 SARS-CoV virus as a proxy or \u201cpoint of reference\u201d, there can be no \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases pertaining to the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The 2019 new coronavirus 2019 nCoV was renamed SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. That explains the 2 suffix. The 2019 novel coronavirus is said to be \u201csimilar\u201d to 2003-SARS-CoV, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-1 (to distinguish it from SARS-CoV-2). The NEW Virus (2019 nCoV) is \u201cnon-existent\u201d (no RT-PCR confirmed cases). The RT-PCR Test Declared Invalid by the WHO Amply documented, the RT-PCR test detects genetic fragments of numerous viruses without being able to identify the virus. See the article below: The WHO Confirms that the Covid-19 PCR Test is Flawed: Estimates of \u201cPositive Cases\u201d are Meaningless. The Lockdown Has No Scientific Basis By Prof Michel Chossudovsky, December 10, 2023 See also our review of the RT- PCR in the Appendix of this article. The significance and ambiguity of the WHO decision \u2013following the advice of the Berlin Virology Institute\u2013 namely the issue of the \u201cisolate\u201d of the novel coronavirus have been casually overlooked. \u201cNo Questions Asked\u201d The British Media reported on February 6, 2020 the change in the name of the virus: \u201c[The] Deadly coronavirus will FINALLY get a name: Scientists plan to officially label the disease \u2018within days\u2019 \u2013 but it won\u2019t be called after any places or animals. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has submitted a name. \u2026 Big Money, Big Pharma. Patent Rights Let\u2019s bear in mind: The Covid Crisis which is still ongoing is a Big Money Operation Worldwide, with numerous Big Pharma products, extending from the global misuse of the RT-PCR test, to the multibillion dollar Big Pharma vaccine project, largely dominated by Pfizer. Was the change in the name of the virus to SARS-CoV-2 an issue of \u201croyalties\u201d and intellectual property rights? The U.S Patent Rights, pertaining to 2003 SARS-CoV was filed in April 2004 and assigned in May 2007 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Patent No.: US 7,220,852 B1 Date of Patent: May 22 2007. (This is a matter for further investigation.) \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d and the \u201cNon-Existent New Virus\u201d. What are the Consequences? As documented above (confirmed by the WHO) the new 2019 corona virus was never identified. The use of a 20 year old virus entitled 2003 SARS-CoV as a proxy for the alleged new virus confirms that there was NO PANDEMIC resulting from a NEW CORONAVIRUS in January-March 2020. THERE WAS NO \u201cNEW VIRUS\u201d. What this signifies is that both the Devastating Lockdown policies imposed on 190 countries (March 11, 2020) as well the Worldwide Rollout of the Covid-19 Vaccine (mid December 2020) are fraudulent. They are based on a \u201cBig Lie\u201d, which has contributed in the course of almost four years to literally destroying people\u2019s lives. In turn the incessant fear campaign had a devastating impact on people\u2019s health, their mental health, including a Worldwide wave of suicides. In several countries suicides among school children were recorded (See Michel Chossudovsky, Chapter VI) \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d Precipitates the Lockdown The unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus has provided a pretext and a justification to powerful financial interests and corrupt politicians to precipitate the entire world into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair. The lockdown was an act of economic and social warfare. The labor force was confined, the work place is frozen, leading to an engineered Worldwide economic collapse. This crisis is by no means over. The entire World is currently strangled in the Most Serious Debt Crisis is World history. All categories of indebtedness (private and public). In the words of the WEF billionaires to those who are loosing their homes or cannot pay their monthly rent: their motto is: \u201cOwn Nothing Be Happy\u201d. The mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d Intended to Protect People against a \u201cNon Existent New Virus\u201d Amply documented the mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d which was intended to protect people against this non-existent new coronavirus renamed SARS-nCoV-2 has resulted in an upward trend in excess mortality. The Pfizer Confidential Report released under Freedom of Information confirms based on their own data that the vaccine is a toxic substance. To access the complete Pfizer report click here The evidence is overwhelming: See the carefully documented impacts of the \u201cvaccine\u201d by Dr. William Makis on people from all walks life: pilots, health workers, school children, students, athletes, pregnant women and new born babies (and many more). Excess Mortality There are numerous studies on vaccine related excess mortality. Below is a summary of an incisive study pertaining to Cancer Related Excess Mortality in England and Wales resulting from the mRNA Vaccine conducted by the team of Edward Dowd Dowd\u2019s method was to analyze the number of deaths attributed to cancer in England and Wales between 2010 and 2022 (based on the data of the U.K. Office for National Statistics). The table below pertains to excess deaths related to malignant neoplasm (cancerous tumor) in England and Wales, recorded in three consecutive years: 2020, 2021, and 2022 vs. a 10 year trend (2010-2019). The data for excess mortality in 2020 (the year prior to the vaccine) are negative with the exception of \u201cmalignant neoplasm without specification of site\u201d. The COVID-19 vaccine was rolled-out in several phases in England and Wales starting on December 8, 2020 and extending into March-April 2021. The upward movement in excess mortality (%) commences in 2021. The increase in excess mortality related to malignant neoplasm is tabulated for the two first years of the vaccine. Below is a similar table pertaining to Excess Mortality in Germany, which points to the Deviation of Observed Mortality from Expected Mortality (by age group) in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Notice the upward shift in excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 following the rollout of the Covid Vaccine in December 2020 Germany: Excess Mortality by Age Group (%) Excess Mortality in Red by age group, Total Excess Mortality in Gray Media Disinformation, Boldface Lies There are numerous studies on excess mortality resulting from the vaccine, which are ignored by the media. Invariably the Press reports state with authority that it is the virus which is \u201cdangerous\u201dor \u201cdeadly\u201d, when in fact it is the \u201cVaccine\u201d which has triggered an upward trend in mortality. The Daily Mail (February 6, 2020) refers to a \u201cdeadly coronavirus\u201d intimating that it is spreading Worldwide The dangerous virus designation is a boldface LIE: Confirmed by the WHO, the CDC and peer reviewed reports, the 2019 nCoV-19 is not dangerous. See the Appendix below. \u201cWhen the Lie Become the Truth, There is No Moving Backwards\u201d CENSORSHIP: The original Global Research video produced by Ariel Rodriguez in February 2021 was taken down by Vimeo on March 5, 2022 Below is the Version on Rumble *** Our thanks to Vaccine Choice Canada Our analysis in this short article has provided evidence: that the alleged NEW CORONAVIRUS entitled 2019 nCoV was never isolated, the renamed new coronavirus entitled SARS-CoV-2 is NOT A NEW VIRUS. It is similar to an OLD VIRUS entitled 2003-SARS-CoV. I should mention that there are many other issues which invalidate the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d, specifically the RT-PCR test which does not identify the virus.

Appendix Our analysis above provides evidence: that the alleged NEW CORONAVIRUS entitled 2019 nCoV was never isolated and that the renamed new coronavirus entitled SARS-CoV-2 is similar to a 20 year old virus entitled 2003-SARS-CoV It should be understood that there are many other issues which invalidate the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d which are not addressed in the article(See sections 1, 2, 3 4 below as well as our review of The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Test Of significance to our understanding of \u201cfear campaigns\u201d, the WHO and CDC confirm that the 2019 nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) is not a dangerous virus. 1. The WHO Statement Regarding 2019-nCoV The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. \u2026 These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\u201d (For further details see Michel Chossudovsky, August 2022, emphasis added) 2. Dr. Anthony Fauci Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in the NEJM From the outset, Fauci has persistently warned of the imminent dangers of the SARS-CoV-2 (including its variants and sub-variants), while acknowledging in his peer reviewed article in the New England Journal of Medicine (together with H. Clifford Lane, M.D. and Robert R. Redfield, M.D. that: \u201cThe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968)\u2026\u201d (See Covid-19 \u2014 Navigating the Uncharted, NEJM) 3. The WHO\u2019s Definition of 2003-SARS SARS is an airborne virus and can spread through small droplets of saliva in a similar way to the cold and influenza. \u2026 SARS can also be spread indirectly via surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus. Most patients identified with SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25\u201370 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition for probable and suspected cases of SARS is around 3%. One month prior to the change of name of the novel 2019 nCoV coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 (On February 11), the WHO released, a detailed document pertaining to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Operational Support & Logistics Disease Commodity Packages pdf). 4. The CDC\u2019s Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with Seasonal Influenza \u201cInfluenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.\u201d",

Author\u2019s Note and Update The World has been in a state of crisis for more than three years despite the fact that the WHO and the CDC (with the usual innuendos) have unequivocally confirmed that the RT-PCR test used to justify every single policy mandate including lockdowns, social distancing, the mask, confinement of the labor force, closure of economic activity, etc. is flawed and invalid. The same applies to the roll-out of the mRNA Vaccine in December 2020. This article was first published on March 21, 2021 focussing on the WHO\u2019s Mea Culpa dated January 20, 2021. The WHO advisory was then followed a few months later by the bombshell decision of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (July 21, 2021) to withdraw the PCR test as a valid method for detecting and identifying SARS-CoV-2. As of December, 31 2021, the PCR test is longer considered valid by the CDC in the U.S. For more details see Bombshell: CDC No Longer Recognizes the PCR Test As a Valid Method for Detecting \u201cConfirmed Covid-19 Cases\u201d? By Prof Michel Chossudovsky, December 29, 2021 What this implies is that both the CDC and the WHO have formally acknowledged the failures of the RT-PCR test, without however implementing a shift in the methodology of detecting and identifying SARS-CoV-2. The Mainstream Media Now Reluctantly Acknowledges that the PCR Test is Flawed After having sustained the propaganda campaign, the mainstream media has now tacitly acknowledged that the PCR TEST IS INVALID. Below is an excerpt from London\u2019s Daily Mail on something which has been known and documented by scientists and the independent media from the outset of the corona crisis in January 2020. The report below is convoluted. It is an obvious understatement: \u201cDid flawed PCR tests convince us Covid was worse than it really was? \u2026 It has been one of the most enduring Covid conspiracy theories: that the \u2018gold standard\u2019 PCR tests used to diagnose the virus were picking up people who weren\u2019t actually infected. Some even suggested the swabs, which have been carried out more than 200 million times in the UK alone, may mistake common colds and flu for corona. If either, or both, were true, it would mean many of these cases should never have been counted in the daily tally \u2013 that the ominous and all-too-familiar figure, which was used to inform decisions on lockdowns and other pandemic measures, was an over-count. (Daily Mail, March 12, 2022, emphasis added) It is carefully worded with a view to protecting the decision-makers. The PCR Test is the Smoking Gun. There is No Pandemic We are not dealing with mistakes as suggested by the above media report. If the PCR test is invalid and meaningless, this means that there is no such thing as a \u201cCovid-19 Confirmed Case\u201d The results of the PCR test routinely tabulated by the WHO have been used to justify the lockdown policies imposed on more than 190 member states of the United Nations. Economic and social chaos has been triggered Worldwide, and these actions adopted by corrupt governments in the course of the last three years are of criminal nature. They are not mistakes. And if there is no Pandemic, there is no need for a vaccine. The Covid-19 mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d is the BIGGEST FRAUD IN MEDICAL HISTORY For further details see my E-Book (15 Chapters) entitled: The Worldwide Corona Crisis: Global Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat against Humanity\u201d By Prof Michel Chossudovsky, August 2022 See also my recent article on the failed identification of 2019-nCoV, which is related to the flawed RT-PCR test. There Never Was a \u201cNew Corona Virus\u201d, There Never Was a Pandemic By Prof Michel Chossudovsky, December 08, 2023 Video: The Non-existent \u201cNew Corona Virus\u201d? Michel Chossudovsky, Interview with Caroline Mailloux, Lux Media Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, December 9, 2023 *** The WHO Confirms that the Covid-19 PCR Test is Flawed: Estimates of \u201cPositive Cases\u201d are Meaningless. Both the Lockdown and the \u201cVaccine\u201d Have No Scientific Basis by Michel Chossudovsky March 21, 2021 Nobel Prize Laureate Kary B. Mullis was the inventor of the polymerase chain reaction technique, which is analyzed in this article. Dr. Kary B. Mullis, who passed away on August 7, 2019 at age 74, stated emphatically that no infection or illness can be accurately diagnosed with the RT-PCR. His legacy will live. \u201cPCR is a Process. It does not tell you that you are sick. \u2026 The measurement is not accurate\u201d. Mullis described the RT-PCR as a \u201ctechnique\u201d rather than \u201ca test\u201d. It is a useful technique which allows for \u201crapid amplification of a small stretch of DNA\u201d. Introduction There is a sequence of outright lies and fabrications used to justify far-reaching policy decisions in the course of the last 20 months. The biggest lie, which is firmly acknowledged both by scientific opinion and the WHO is that the RT-PCR test used to \u201cdetect\u201d the spread of the virus (as well as the variants) is not only flawed but TOTALLY INVALID. From the outset in January 2020, all far-reaching policy decisions upheld and presented to the public as a \u201cmeans to saving lives\u201d were based on flawed and invalid RT-PCR case positives. These invalid Covid-19 \u201cestimates\u201d have been used to justify confinement, social distancing, the face mask, the prohibition of social gatherings, cultural and sports events, the closure of economic activity, as well as the mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d launched in November 2020. The RT-PCR Test The Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test was adopted by the WHO on January 23, 2020 as a means to detecting the SARS-COV-2 virus, following the recommendations of a Virology research group (based at Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, Berlin), supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (For Further details see the Drosten Study) Exactly one year later on January 20th, 2021, the WHO retracts. They don\u2019t say \u201cWe Made a Mistake\u201d. The retraction is carefully formulated. (See original WHO document here as well as in Annex) While the WHO does not deny the validity of their misleading January 2020 guidelines, they nonetheless recommend \u201cRe-testing\u201d (which everybody knows is an impossibility). The contentious issue pertains to the number of amplification threshold cycles (Ct). According to Pieter Borger, et al The number of amplification cycles [should be] less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles. In case of virus detection, >35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture\u2026(Critique of Drosten Study) The World Health Organization (WHO) tacitly admits one year later that ALL PCR tests conducted at a 35 cycle amplification threshold (Ct) or higher are INVALID. But that is what they recommended in January 2020, in consultation with the virology team at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin. If the test is conducted at a 35 Ct threshold or above (which was recommended by the WHO), genetic segments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be detected, which means that ALL the so-called confirmed \u201cpositive cases\u201d tabulated in the course of the last 18 months are invalid. According to Pieter Borger, Bobby Rajesh Malhotra, Michael Yeadon, et al, the Ct > 35 has been the norm \u201cin most laboratories in Europe & the US\u201d. The WHO\u2019s Mea Culpa Below is the WHO\u2019s carefully formulated \u201cRetraction\u201d. The full text with link to the original document is in annex: WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient\u2019s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology. (emphasis added) WHO reminds IVD users that disease prevalence alters the predictive value of test results; as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases (2). This means that the probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity. \u201cInvalid Positives\u201d is the Underlying Concept This is not an issue of \u201cWeak Positives\u201d and \u201cRisk of False Positive Increases\u201d. What is at stake is a \u201cFlawed Methodology\u201d which leads to invalid estimates. What this admission of the WHO confirms is that the estimate of covid positive from a PCR test (with an amplification threshold of 35 cycles or higher) is invalid. In which case, the WHO recommends retesting: \u201ca new specimen should be taken and retested\u2026\u201d. The WHO calls for \u201cRetesting\u201d, which is tantamount to \u201cWe Screwed Up\u201d. That recommendation is pro-forma. It won\u2019t happen. Millions of people Worldwide have already been tested, starting in early February 2020. Nonetheless, we must conclude that unless retested, those estimates (according to the WHO) are invalid. I should mention that there are several other related flaws regarding the PCR test which are not addressed in this article. (See Michel Chossudovsky\u2019s E-book: click to download The Worldwide Corona Crisis: Global Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat against Humanity (Chapter III) From the outset, the PCR test has routinely been applied at a Ct amplification threshold of 35 or higher, following the January 2020 recommendations of the WHO. What this means is that the PCR methodology as applied Worldwide has in the course of the last 12-14 months led to the compilation of faulty and misleading Covid statistics. And these are the statistics which are used to measure the progression of the so-called \u201cpandemic\u201d. Above an amplification cycle of 35 or higher, the test will not detect fragments of the virus. Therefore, the official \u201ccovid numbers\u201d are meaningless. It follows that there is no scientific basis for confirming the existence of a pandemic. Which in turn means that the lockdown \/ economic measures which have resulted in social panic, mass poverty and unemployment (allegedly to curtail the spread of the virus) have no justification whatsoever. According to scientific opinion: \u201cif someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe & the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% (Pieter Borger, Bobby Rajesh Malhotra, Michael Yeadon, Clare Craig, Kevin McKernan, et al, Critique of Drosten Study) As outlined above, \u201cthe probability that said result is a false positive is 97%\u201d: It follows that using the >35 cycles detection will indelibly contribute to \u201chiking up\u201d the number of \u201cfake positives\u201d. At the time of writing (mid-March 2021), despite the WHO retraction, the PCR test is being used extensively to hike up the numbers with a view to sustaining the fear campaign, justifying the ongoing lockdown policies as well as the implementation of the Covid vaccine. Ironically, the flawed numbers based on \u201cinvalid positives\u201d are in turn being manipulated to ensure an upward trend in so-called \u201cConfirmed Covid -19 Cases\u201d. Moreover, those PCR tests are not routinely accompanied by a medical diagnosis of the patients who are being tested. And now, national health authorities have issued (fake) warnings of a \u201cThird Wave\u201d as part of their propaganda campaign in support of the Covid-19 Vaccine. The WHO confirms that the Covid PCR test procedure as applied is invalid. There is absolutely no scientific basis for implementing the Covid Vaccine. Both the WHO and the scientific assessment of Pieter Borger, et al (quoted above) confirm unequivocally that the tests adopted by governments to justify the lockdown and the destabilization of national economies are INVALID. Invalid Data and the Numbers\u2019 Game It should be understood that these \u201cinvalid estimates\u201d are the \u201cnumbers\u201d quoted relentlessly 24\/7 by the media in the course of the \u201cFirst Wave\u201d and \u201cSecond Wave\u201d, which have been used to feed the fear campaign and \u201cjustify\u201d ALL the policies put forth by the governments: lockdown, closure of economic activity, poverty and mass unemployment, bankruptcies social distancing, face mask, curfew, the vaccine. the health passport Invalid Data. Think Twice Before Getting Vaccinated And Now we have entered a so-called \u201cThird Wave\u201d. (But where\u2019s the data??) It\u2019s a complex \u201cPack of Lies\u201d.

My intent was essentially to Refute and Reveal the Big Lie (focussing on scientific and statistical concepts) without directly addressing the broader implications of the lockdown and closure of economic activity. This diabolical project which emanates from the upper echelons of the financial establishment (including the World Economic Forum) is destroying people\u2019s lives Worldwide. It is creating mass unemployment, triggering famines in developing countries. With some exceptions including Tanzania, most of the 193 member states of the United Nations have endorsed the WEF\u2019s \u201ccorona consensus\u201d. The Truth is a peaceful yet powerful weapon. Now is the time to confront those governments and demand a repeal of the lockdown policies which are triggering poverty and despair Worldwide. The WHO\u2019s BIG LIE is refuted by the WHO. The alleged pandemic is a scam. That is something which cannot be denied or refuted. And that was the object of this article. It\u2019s a complex scam based on \u201ca pack of lies\u201d with devastating consequences. In the course of the last 14 months starting in early January 2020, I have analyzed almost on a daily basis the timeline and evolution of the Covid crisis. From the very outset in January 2020, people were led to believe and accept the existence of a rapidly progressing and dangerous epidemic. We are at the crossroads of one of the most serious crises in World history. We are living history, yet our understanding of the sequence of events since January 2020 has been blurred. Worldwide, people have been misled both by their governments and the media as to the causes and devastating consequences of the Covid-19 \u201cpandemic\u201d. The unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus provides a pretext and a justification to powerful financial interests and corrupt politicians to precipitate the entire World into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair. More than 7 billion people Worldwide are directly or indirectly affected by the corona crisis. Click to consult: (E-Book, 15 Chapters) Also please forward this article. Your support is invaluable. Michel Chossudovsky, Biographical Note Michel Chossudovsky\u2019s Articles on Global Research Full text of the WHO directive dated January 20, 2021 Annex Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) Technologies that Use Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Product type: Nucleic acid testing (NAT) technologies that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Date: 13 January 2021 WHO-identifier: 2020\/5, version 2 Target audience: laboratory professionals and users of IVDs. Purpose of this notice: clarify information previously provided by WHO. This notice supersedes WHO Information Notice for In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device (IVD) Users 2020\/05 version 1, issued 14 December 2020. Description of the problem: WHO requests users to follow the instructions for use (IFU) when interpreting results for specimens tested using PCR methodology. Users of IVDs must read and follow the IFU carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended by the manufacturer. WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient\u2019s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology. WHO reminds IVD users that disease prevalence alters the predictive value of test results; as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases (2). This means that the probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity. Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis, therefore, health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts, and epidemiological information. Actions to be taken by IVD users: Please read carefully the IFU in its entirety. Contact your local representative if there is any aspect of the IFU that is unclear to you. Check the IFU for each incoming consignment to detect any changes to the IFU. Provide the Ct value in the report to the requesting health care provider. Notes 1. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.

His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. \u2014Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that \u201cthere is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.\u201d In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. \u2013David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky\u2019s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d\u2019\u00e9tat under way called \u201cThe Great Reset\u201d that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

        "text":"\u201cWhere have all the rebels gone?\u201d Apparently, that is the question asked by the famed singer Eric Clapton in a message forwarded by him to the Producer Robin Monotti Graziadei. Eric Clapton is also said to have reported adverse reactions after taking the COVID19 vaccine and overtly expressed his regret of undergoing the procedure in his message to the producer. The singer\u2019s message clearly stated \u2013 \u201cIn February this year, before I learned about the nature of the vaccines, (and being 76 with emphysema) I was in the avant-garde. I took the first jab of AZ and straight away had severe reactions which lasted ten days, I recovered eventually and was told it would be twelve weeks before the second one\u2026\u201d Eric Blames Vaccine Propaganda The singer told in the message that he is an \u2018old timer\u2019 and has survived addiction and alcoholism with great help from those around him. However, he openly criticized and blamed the vaccine propaganda for the adverse reaction he had to suffer. One of his statements said \u2013 \u201cAbout six weeks later I was offered and took the second AZ shot but with a little more knowledge of the dangers. Needless to say, the reactions were disastrous, my hands and feet were either frozen, numb, or burning, and pretty much useless for two weeks, I feared I would never play again, (I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and should never have gone near the needle.) But the propaganda said the vaccine was safe for everyone.\u201d The Singer\u2019s Bellow Against Tyranny Facing adverse health conditions from the COV19 vaccine, Eric Clapton openly called out for the \u2018rebels\u2019 to come out and speak up against the mass vaccination propaganda that is playing with millions of lives. His exact words said \u2013 \u201cWhere have all the rebels gone? Hiding behind their computer screens. Where\u2019s the spirit, where is the soul? Where have all the rebels gone\u201d The singer continued further \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been a rebel all my life, against tyranny and arrogant authority, which is what we have now, but I also crave fellowship, compassion and love, and that I find here\u2026I believe with these things we can prevail.\u201d Do you stand with the artist\u2019s voice for making this world free of tyranny and propaganda?

        "link":"https:\/\/healingoracle.ch\/2021\/08\/27\/covid-pathogen-not-vaccine-is-unsafe\/",
        "text":"In a ground breaking law suit the Covid vaccination has been deemed by the Supreme Court to be unsafe, as Bill Gates, US Chief Infectious Disease Specialist Fauci and Big Pharma have failed a lawsuit in the US Supreme Court that scientists led by Senator Kennedy filed. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sending this clear message: \u201cThe COVID vaccine should be avoided at all costs.\u201d Kennedy Junior further stated \u2013 \u201cAlthough mRNA vaccines are considered a promising treatment option, the procedure can be defined as genetic manipulation because it changes the patient\u2019s DNA. Previously, genetic manipulation was prohibited and viewed as criminal activity. What has commonly been referred to as a vaccine is derived from a microbe or virus that is killed or attenuated and introduced into the body to work against itself.\u201d \u201cIt is not that at all! It is part of the newest group of mRNA (mRNA) allegedly \u201cvaccines\u201d \u2013 Kennedy Jr. went on to state. As we have previously reported the huge vaccine trial that is going on across the world is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis on a scale we have not yet seen. And as we revealed in March 2021, one of the world\u2019s leading vaccine experts Geert Vanden Bossche, (PhD DVM) came out to risk his career and reputation to warn humanity against the risks of this experimental shot, he warned in this open letter: \u201cAs a dedicated virologist and vaccine expert I only make an exception when the Health Authority has allowed vaccines to be administered in ways that threaten public-health, most certainly when scientific evidence is being ignored. The present extremely critical situation forces me to spread this emergency call. As the unprecedented extent of human intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic is now at risk of resulting in a global catastrophe without equal this call cannot sound loudly and strongly enough. Sufficient scientific evidence has been brought to the table. Unfortunately, it remains untouched by those who have the power to act. How long can one ignore the problem when there is at present massive evidence that viral immune escape is now threatening humanity? We can hardly say we didn\u2019t know \u2013 or were not warned.\u201d Once introduced into the cell, mRNA reprograms normal RNA \/ DNA to begin producing a new protein. That means it has nothing to do with traditional vaccines or how we are told vaccines work. Damage Caused By Vaccines Vaccinated individuals will always have to live with the consequences of their condition since they cannot cure themselves by purging toxins from their bodies as we have seen with people with conditions such as several illnesses and disorders like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner Syndrome, genetic heart failure, or hemophilia. Lawsuits against Covid Vaccines The CHD is working with a consortium of lawyers to prepare legal challenges for forthcoming vaccine mandates, including mandated vaccines and as we reported mass death due to Covid vaccination in the US and other instances. Big Win for All of Us Now Federal law has stepped in and prohibits emergency room personnel from imposing COVID vaccines, tests, and masks. So get to know your rights, as this is a step towards a safer world where justice has finally been served. Share & spread the word!",

        "link":"https:\/\/healingoracle.ch\/2021\/10\/18\/show-me-your-covid-qr-code-or-you-cannot-pass\/",
        "text":"SHOW ME YOUR COVID QR CODE, OR YOU CANNOT PASS With the pandemonium caused by the \u2018pandemic\u2019, Covid Pass restrictions have been heavily imposed on citizens throughout Europe. As of now, 14 European countries have different domestic restrictions based on the Covid Pass. Within Europe, every country has imposed travel restrictions based on the Covid Passes. With some countries in Europe the restrictions are light, but in some like Lithuania the restrictions to those that choose not to vaccinate are heavy and oppressive. With people losing many of their basic human rights, losing their jobs and losing their liberty. Whilst the vaccines themselves are still in trial and have many reported dangerous side effects and even a supreme court ruling against it, it is no wonder that many citizens do not want to take this risk, leading to mass protests across Europe and the world that is not ever discussed by or shown on the mainstream median channels. In May 2021, many EU countries introduced a Covid Pass for domestic called the \u201cOpportunity Pass\u201d and here we describe how in Lithuania in particular, the government has created two different freedoms of movement for the vaccinated and the non vaccinated. The differences are staggering as the non vaccinated have become outcasts, demonized by the mainstream and fired from their jobs. IF you agree to getting the vaccine and the pass then you are given freedom of movement, if however you choose to obtain, the consequences are far reaching and debilitating. The pass allows you a participation opportunity in society. Without it, citizens lack an opportunity and have many restricted rights. Here\u2019s how you get Opportunity Pass: You must be fully vaccinated with doses from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or J&J. A negative PCR test (valid for 48 hours after sample collection). Or have proof of Covid contamination within the last 7 months. The Covid Pass provided by the government is in the form of a QR code. To use it, citizens show the QR code to a \u201cverifier\u201d scanner. The scanner confirms and authenticates the Pass. Once verified with your safe health status, you then need to show your ID to the verifier & confirm the match of information contained in the Pass & your ID. In Lithuania at least, the technology has become the ruling authority on people\u2019s movements in many European countries and the world. This has happened right under our noses as the freedom of movement is becoming more and more restricted. Restrictions for people without the Opportunity Pass Bearing in mind the dangers of the vaccines, the unvaccinated will become more and more restricted. These are some of the restrictions: Can\u2019t visit cafes, restaurants, \u201cnon-essential\u201d stores, shopping centers, public indoor spaces, fitness centers, gyms, or saunas. Citizens are barred from attending outdoor events of more than 500 people. Citizens may be barred from traveling by train. Students will be barred from entering university without the Pass. Citizens are banned from visiting patients in medical facilities, or senior care, the only exception being terminally ill patients & children under 14 years of age (with doctor\u2019s advance permission). Exception: Citizens are eligible to receive emergency care without an Opportunity Pass. A fig-leaf to mask the Coercion: The government opposes the fact that the vaccine is non-mandatory, as citizens still get the Opportunity Pass if they have proven immunity from infections, or do the tests. That\u2019s the fig leaf that masks the pressure to get vaccinated. The testing option is similarly designed to be difficult. Earlier, people could get tests for free through government health plans. Now, it\u2019s a mandate to get tested for the Opportunity Pass at private labs with your own money and a negative result is merely valid for 48 hours from the time of sample collection. Not many will be willing to do a test every 1-2 days to live life freely. The money and time make the idea incompatible for the vast majority of the population. As per the government mandate, only PCR tests are acceptable for the Pass, that\u2019s another burden of testing. On average, the tests would cost more than 1000 EUR in lab fees per person per month in addition to the time of visiting the lab. The result is citizens are hugely burdened and pressurised into the vaccinations, over testing and free movement. This is Government coercion to get vaccinated on a global scale and must be opposed! The Fight for freedom Covid restrictions have introduced an authoritarian form of government in the European Union to the kind of scale we have never seen before. During the 20th century there were many wars and battles against this kind of government-led authoritarian regimes and the propaganda of the \u201cShow me your documents\u201d authoritarianism of the USSR. Yet this regime of government control did not involve a single tank or missile, instead it has been media led as as psychological war upon the medical world as the reported \u2018pandemic\u2019 led to a vaccine mandate that has paved the way for total political reform within the space of less than two years. So we now see a total compliance to this new regime of media-led propaganda and the fear-driven health authoritarianism of \u201cShow me your Covid QR Code!\u201d. What can be done about it all? Has the battle been lost and the war already been won? What can now be done we ask? Please read Gluboco Lietuva, an ordinary Lithuanian man\u2019s account of what it is like to make a choice against this new oppressive regime. He talks of the perils and challenges he faces in his country preceding the mandate for \u2018Opportunity Pass\u2019 as he and his wife have so far chosen not to have the vaccine.

Several doctors and senior journalists have come forward to claim that mass PCR testing for COVID19 could be World Health Organization\u2019s biggest covert vaccination campaign. This suspicion is further strengthened by the fact that in January 2019, WHO defined the growing number of vaccination critics as one of the top ten threats to global health. Since the unprecedented Corona vaccination failure, the number of vaccination refusers has only gone up since then. John Hopkins University Confirms \u2018Covert Vaccination\u2019 Technique Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a new device that can be implanted into the body and deliver drugs. The researchers were inspired by parasitic worms, which dig their sharp teeth into the intestines of their host to feed off them with blood through spongy cells in the gut wall called villi. To mimic this process, they created tiny star-shaped devices that attach themselves onto intestinal mucosa and release drugs internally as well as externally for better absorption. The tiny devices known as Theragrippers are made of metal and a thin film that changes shape. They cover the heat-sensitive wax with kerosene, which is no larger than dust particles themselves. The Theragripper is a tiny, six-pointed device that clamps onto the wall of the colon. The kerosene coating on these devices reaches body temperature when inserted into your gastrointestinal tract and they close up autonomously to hold themselves in place. When attached, this creates an airtight seal which allows for the gradual release of drugs from one or more points along its surface over time until it falls out naturally through normal muscle motion at some point later down the line! History is witness to such inhumane authoritarian acts If you can\u2019t imagine the government administering toxins to you against your will and without your consent, think of all the horrific experiments on humans that were conducted in the name of \u2018mass healthcare,\u2019 \u2018medical research,\u2019 and \u2018humanitarian missions.\u2019 For instance, in 2007, the CDC even admitted that between 1955 and 1963, 10-30 million citizens were infected with the carcinogen SV40 via polio vaccination. Moreover, we have documented earlier how even the Doctors are flying blind with the COVID vaccine, resulting in disability and death for many. Don\u2019t let them invade your mind, body, and soul.

        "text":"A claim that the administration of President Joe Biden is covering up at least 45,000 vaccine-related deaths is seeping onto social media. The narrative comes from a whistleblower\u2019s complaint based on an alleged analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The complaint appeared in a lawsuit by attorney Thomas Renz, who is representing America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a right-wing organization. Background Story Behind the Claim On Sunday, a video was posted to BitChute that shows Renz speaking on the \u201cReAwaken America\u201d conspiracy theory tour, where he announced that he was filing papers in federal court. Renz cited a whistleblower, \u201cJane Doe,\u201d and claimed that \u201cwe know, based on what she said, that there had been at least 45,000 deaths from this vaccine\u201d within three days of receiving it. Since then, the video has surfaced on multiple sites. Many posters of the video have argued that the allegations made during Renz\u2019s speech provided evidence that the federal government was lying about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. Who is Thomas Renz? Renz is an Ohio attorney who has vocally taken a stance against COVID-19 mask mandates and vaccinations. The video in question was recorded on July 18 and posted the following day to BitChute, a social video-hosting platform that was launched in 2017 as an alternative to YouTube. The Government Has Lied Before We\u2019ve already published about how you are being lied to in one of our many articles. Many incidents of vaccine-related diseases, cancer, and even death have been openly reported. Though, it seems like the propaganda is winning. Probably this is the reason the government wants to \u2018Criminalize\u2019 truth speakers under the label of \u2018fake news.\u2019 Wake up and absorb the truth. Love & light!",

        "text":"We\u2019ve talked about the imminent vaccine tragedy earlier. Doctors are playing with our health by using the COVID19 vaccine without knowing its effects. There have been many reports of people dying and suffering lifelong damaging side-effects due to untested Covid vaccinations. This blog will talk about the dangers of vaccines and why they should be avoided at all costs despite what the proponents might say. 18-Year Old Dies of COVID Vaccine A young woman in Nevada suffered from severe headaches, seizures, and weakness on one side of her body. Doctors were shocked to see someone so young with symptoms typical of strokes. The scans revealed several large blood clots in the veins that drain blood from the brain, a condition that could lead to paralysis or death. The doctors were surprised to find that she had new clots forming just hours after the previous ones were removed. The patient is one of six women ages 18 to 48 who developed clots in the brain within two weeks of receiving the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine. She died from this \u2018blind\u2019 administration by doctors. More Such Cases Coming In Since then, two more cases have been added to the unfortunate list. One person got the vaccine during clinical trials, and one person got the vaccine after it was approved for general use. They both suffer from the same symptoms as did the poor woman. Doctors Admit to \u2018Flying Blind\u2019 With Vaccine Administration Dr. Brian Lipman states \u2013 \u201cWe were flying blind, based on reports from Europe and the U.K. hematological society.\u201d The reason was later found to be heparin, a blood-thinner used by medical practitioners throughout the United States. Now the question arises \u2013 why would doctors release a vaccine that is unsafe for people and its after-effects are unknown to them? Does a carefree statement like \u2018flying blind\u2019 and wholehearted acceptance of the situation compensate for those who lost their lives? COVID Vaccine Deaths are Not New! Two more deaths were reported to the FDA. The first death was a 39-year-old woman who died of pulmonary embolism after receiving her COVID vaccination. The second death, which can be found on an official document from CDC\u2019s VAERS system is that of a nine-year-old boy who also suffered from pulmonary embolisms and died two weeks after his COVID vaccine. Many more deaths, on a scale of hundreds, have been reported across the globe \u2013 proving vaccines are nothing more than just dangerous tools of enforcing fear and control. This article makes it clear that doctors have no idea what they are doing with these vaccines due to their lack of knowledge about them \u2013 but at least people will know now!

        "text":"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News As we now enter into the time of year here in North American that is usually labeled as the \u201cflu season\u201d but is now more commonly known as the \u201cCOVID season\u201d where Big Pharma begins their big push to get everyone injected with their toxic and deadly flu shots and COVID shots, it is time to review the abundance of research that exists for non-Pharma natural remedies that far outperform vaccines and drugs in preparing your body for shorter daylight hours and colder temperatures. I am calling these remedies \u201cGod-Created\u201d remedies because they are found in God\u2019s Creation, and cannot be patented by man and drug companies because they are found in nature and are available to everyone without having to obtain permission (drug prescriptions) from medical priests. The scientific evidence of how effective these God-Created remedies are is overwhelming, but the Big Pharma Cult and their puppet corporate media shills will do everything they can to discredit this research and evidence, in favor of marketing their poisonous drugs and vaccines to you instead. Vitamin D: Super Flu\/COVID Prevention At the top of the list in preventing these seasonal illnesses (which are NOT caused by \u201cviruses\u201d) is Vitamin D. As I am writing this today, October 1, 2023, it is now time to start taking or increasing your intake of Vitamin D, if you are not spending enough time outdoors and getting it directly from the sun, which is the best method of \u201ctaking\u201d Vitamin D. Numerous peer-reviewed published studies have linked an increase in Vitamin D uptake with a decrease in influenza infection during the flu seasons. The logic is easy to understand: winter brings shorter days with less sunlight, when influenza is most prevalent, while influenza outbreaks are rare during the summer months with increased exposure to sunlight, the most common source of Vitamin D. If you search for \u201cVitamin D\u201d on Health Impact News, you will get over 500 results. One of the studies we have highlighted is a meta-study that looked at 25 separate studies involving over 11,000 people and was published in the British Medical Journal in 2017. Here are a few more among the hundreds we have published: However, other studies have also been published which seem contradictory, showing little to no association of uptake in Vitamin D with a decrease in flu infections. These studies have, obviously, been highlighted more by the corporate-sponsored \u201cmainstream\u201d media in their efforts to market the annual flu (and now COVID) vaccine. A study published from researchers in Japan in 2017 may have unraveled this seeming paradox, which is exactly what they set out to study: Several intervention studies have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on influenza or influenza-like illness, but their results have been inconsistent. We prospectively examined the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with influenza among Japanese workers. (Source.) In their conclusion, they admit that overall the statistics did not significantly lower the risk of influenza through Vitamin D supplementation, except for one sub-group \u2013 those who had NOT received a flu vaccine. They wrote: In a subgroup of participants without vaccination, vitamin D sufficiency (\u226530 ng\/mL) was associated with a significantly lower risk of influenza (odds ratio 0.14; 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.74). Could this be the reason why there are seemingly contradicting results from studies looking at Vitamin D levels and rates of influenza? Could the flu vaccine itself be preventing the body\u2019s own immune system from benefiting with higher levels of Vitamin D to naturally fight off flu infections? The researchers from Japan stated that more research is needed to look at why unvaccinated Japanese employees had a better rate of resisting flu infections with higher levels of Vitamin D. Here are some more comments from the full study (Abstract here): According to the results of cubic spline regression analysis, the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and influenza appeared to be linear (from 21.9 ng\/mL of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D) among participants who were not vaccinated for influenza, influenza, with the odds of influenza steadily decreasing with increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. In this nested case-control study among Japanese workers, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at baseline were not appreciably associated with influenza risk. Among participants who did not receive vaccination, however, we found a significantly decreased risk of influenza in the highest category of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. To our knowledge, this was the first prospective study to exclusively examine the association of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with the risk of influenza. Vaccination may confound the association between 25-hydroxyvitamn D concentration and influenza. Alternatively, it could be that the protective effect of vitamin D against influenza, which may be masked in the presence of influenza vaccination, is evident only among unvaccinated individuals, who should rely on innate immunity, a hypothesized mechanism by which vitamin D prevents influenza infection. Seasonal Sickness? Vitamin C Mega Dose Once you come down with a seasonal sickness which is labeled as \u201cflu\u201d or \u201cCOVID,\u201d then the best documented remedy is megadoses of Vitamin C. A search on \u201cVitamin C\u201d on Health Impact News will result in over 400 articles. The best way to get megadoses of Vitamin C into your body is via an IV drip, but that is expensive, and the Vitamin C does not stay in the body long, so multiple dosing is needed. Ascorbic acid, preferably sodium ascorbate, is a more affordable solution, but it can irritate the stomach in higher doses. Liposomal Vitamin C is a better alternative to take higher doses without irritating the stomach, but it is more expensive. When COVID first \u201cbroke out\u201d in China in 2020, many Chinese practitioners just treated it the same as the seasonal flu with Vitamin C megadosing, with great success. Some doctors in the U.S. also started treating COVID patients victims with Vitamin C. But the pharmakeia priests stepped in and sent their medical mafia police to put a stop to that. One doctor in Michigan was raided by the FBI and arrested for the crime of healing COVID patients with Vitamin C, and another Michigan doctor was censored by the FTC for trying to publish his protocols using God-Created remedies like Vitamin C, and he was forced to take down his website. Here is the best article with the accompanying video that highlights all the scientific research on the curative powers of Vitamin C. Bone Broths and Chicken Soup Bone broths and chicken soup should be a regular part of your diet during this flu\/COVID season. While we have not retained all of the viewer stats on some of our older articles that have gone through multiple website changes over the years, this was our #1 most-viewed flu season article for years (millions of views), which was written by John Summerly at PreventDisease.com. Besides the super-spice garlic, ginger is another super-spice with tons of scientific research backing up its claims to fight off illness. A search on ginger at Health Impact News will turn up over 100 results. I was actually not feeling well myself today, and had no intentions of writing an article as I rested today, but I made a variation of the \u201cgarlic soup\u201d recipe in the link above, but using more ginger than garlic, and as I sipped on it listening to uplifting worship music, I began to feel better and decided I needed to share this information with you all, to hopefully help you beat the flu\/COVID fear propaganda, and avoid the pharma toxic and deadly drugs and vaccines, as everything I have shared here is old information I have already written about previously. Please make use of Health Impact News and the nearly 9,000 articles we have published since 2011, by utilizing the search feature on this website, because most of these articles will NOT turn up today in the Big Tech search engines. Here is an article about how to make more nutrient-dense soups using bone broths: Here is an article about bone broths that also includes some videos on how to make your own: I offer all of this information to the public for free, as I take no salary from my writings. I do have an online store, however, and if you don\u2019t want to take the time to make your own bone broths, we do sell bone stock from our grass-fed meats and pastured poultry products that you can use to make your own broths.

        "text":"A report quietly published by the UK Government confirms the COVID-19 injections are far from effective because the unvaccinated population has accounted for just 5% of COVID-19 deaths in England since the beginning of 2023, while the 3 and 4 times vaccinated population has accounted for 95% of COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated, with the vast majority of those deaths being recorded among the 4x vaccinated. Let\u2019s not lose touch\u2026Your Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Expos\u00e9 to serve their own needs. Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox\u2026 Following our vigorous reporting of the horrific truth, the UK Government tried to hide the number of Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status from the public by excluding the data from the UK Health Agency\u2019s (UKHSA) weekly Vaccine Surveillance Reports in April 2022 under the guise of the data no longer being needed because the UK Government was stopping free universal Covid-19 testing. But the real reason for trying to hide the data was that the vaccinated accounted for the majority of COVID-19 deaths ever since July 2021 and the figures revealed the COVID-19 vaccines had a negative effectiveness. The following chart shows the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England in the Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 \u2013 This is nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by Pfizer, is it? But the UK Government didn\u2019t count on the fact that the data could be found in the future in reports published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Even if they did make it a painstaking process to collate and calculate. The most recent dataset can be found on the ONS website here, or downloaded here. The dataset includes deaths by vaccination status between 1st April 2021 and 31st May 2023. But because we have extensively looked at deaths up to the end of 2022 in previously published datasets we decided to take a look at Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status from the beginning of 2023. What we found is truly horrifying. Click to Enlarge Source The unvaccinated accounted for the least amount of COVID-19 deaths in every single month up to May 2023, barely even getting into triple figures in most months. Whereas the vaccinated population accounted for the majority of Covid-19 deaths every single month, hitting four figures in every month except for May. But what\u2019s curious about the figures is that it\u2019s not the one-dose, or double-vaccinated population who accounted for the majority of COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of 2023. It\u2019s instead the triple and quadruple-vaccinated population that have accounted for the majority of COVID-19 deaths. With the most deaths occurring among the quadruple-vaccinated by a significant margin. The following chart shows the total number of COVID-19 deaths by vaccinated status throughout the entire year and reveals the true extent of the shocking statistics \u2013 Click to Enlarge Source The unvaccinated didn\u2019t even reach four figures, with just 436 deaths between January and May 2023. But the vaccinated population almost hit five figures with 8,330 COVID-19 deaths, 1,032 of which were among the triple vaccinated, and 6,902 of which were shockingly among the quadruple vaccinated. This means, as is shown in the following chart, that the vaccinated population as a whole accounted for 95% of all COVID-19 deaths between January and May 2023, while the unvaccinated population accounted for just 5%. Click to Enlarge Source But it\u2019s the fact that these deaths aren\u2019t among the one-dose and two-dose vaccinated population that is truly horrifying. The vast majority are among the 4x vaccinated, with this population accounting for 80% of all COVID-19 deaths, and 83% of all COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated. However, when coupled with the triple vaccinated we find the 3 and 4x vaccinated account for 91% of all COVID-19 deaths and 95% of COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated. These aren\u2019t the kind of figures you would expect to see if the COVID-19 injections really are up to 95% effective at preventing death, are they? How can the Government carry on with its COVID vaccination campaign when figures like this are being recorded? If the injection were safe and effective we should be seeing 95% of COVID-19 deaths among the unvaccinated population, not the vaccinated population. And that\u2019s precisely why they should discontinue their use just as Iceland has.",
