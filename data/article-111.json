As a result, seroprevalence surveys measuring the population immune response to SARS-CoV-2 remain integral for understanding cumulative population exposure and insight into pandemic dynamics during the COVID-19 pre-vaccination era [4, 5] . As far as we know, and as summarized in Table 1 and the Supplementary material (Table S6 ), all population-based seroprevalence surveys published in peer-reviewed literature until 31 January 2021 were conducted during or just following the pandemic's first wave [4,6e17] . The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis, also assessing non-peer-reviewed seroprevalence surveys deposited in open-access preprint repositories or posted at websites, showed a general lack of peer-reviewed population-based studies from much of the world and significant data heterogeneity, and called for longitudinal surveys to continually monitor seroprevalence around the globe [2] .",

Such serosurveys are particularly useful in settings where limited SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and/or contact tracing capacity prevents reliable assessment of the COVID-19 burden through cumulative incidence data from official notification systems, which is an unfortunate reality in most of the world. To address this knowledge gap, in March 2020 the WHO recommended nationwide population-based, age-stratified epidemiological surveys and designed a flexible investigation study protocol to facilitate the collection and sharing of COVID-19 epidemiological data in a standardized format [27] . As a result, numerous SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys on a probability-based sample were performed, but so far the majority have resulted in reports deposited in open-access preprint repositories or posted on websites [2] , and only a dozen have had results published in peerreviewed literature [4,6e17] . Comparing the results of published seroprevalence surveys is complicated because serological assay combinations with substantially different performance characteristics and different approaches regarding estimate calculations and interpretation of the results were used and, despite being labelled as probability-based sample surveys, the great majority excluded children or adolescents, or included only individuals seeking various health-care services, resulting in underrepresentation of younger cohorts. In addition, with the start of large-scale vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the value and purpose of populationbased seroprevalence surveys will shift from past/current aims toward the duration and dynamic of protective immunity after vaccination to dictate the future course of public health measures and mitigating strategies [28] .",

            "text": "Slovenia was relatively spared during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, with approximately 1400 cumulative laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 50 deaths/million reported (Fig. 1) . After 2 months of draconian containment measures, based on favourable incidence data from the national official notification system and supported by low active COVID-19 prevalence estimates in a nationwide study on a probability-based sample [6] , the restrictions in the country started to loosen in May 2020, ultimately leading to Slovenia being the first country in Europe to officially declare the end of the first wave of the epidemic as of 31 May 2020. However, because of an initially very conservative national diagnostic strategy (mainly due to a limited supply of reagents and consumables), it was predicted that the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases captured through the official national notification system poorly reflected actual cumulative SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the first wave. When deciding in late April 2020 which anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay to use for testing the firstround samples, we and many others had no other choice than to use assay(s) with largely unproven performance, with very limited real-life experience in daily diagnostics and in population-based studies, heavily relying on the manufacturer's evaluation data and/or limited independent evaluation data, with the assay's performance assessed on a very limited number of samples and on a potentially biased sample population. As a result of extreme containment measures at that time (total lockdown, border closure), the only assay with relatively reliable performance data and with the assay quantities available to us for timely testing of all first-round samples was Euroimmun's ELISA. From today's perspective it is obvious that our initial estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia for late April 2020 corrected for the manufacturer's estimate of ELISA specificity (2.78%) was an overestimation that was later corrected using two completely different week 52 in 2020 captured though the national official notification system. New laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases per week are presented using blue bars, and the corresponding numbers are on the right y-axis. The cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases is presented by the dotted line, and corresponding numbers are on the left y-axis. For a nationwide seroprevalence population study on a probability-based sample, blood samples were collected between 20 April and 1 May 2020 (first study round) and 17 October and 10 November 2020 (second study round). National official notification system row data are available at https://www.nijz.si/sl/dnevno-spremljanje-okuzb-s-sars-cov-2-covid-19. Total data are presented from week 5 to week 52 in 2020; detailed data from week 9 to week 20 in 2020 are presented in the magnified window. approaches. First, after accumulation of published manufacturerindependent ELISA performance data, we innovatively corrected the first-round seroprevalence using pooled 'meta-specificity' (see Supplementary material, item S3). Second, when it became clear that concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins offers reliable seroprevalence estimates in low-prevalence settings [3, 5, 18, 19, 24, 29, 30] , all firstround samples were retested in November 2020 using an Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S combination. Interestingly, using these two different approachesdcorrection of suboptimal ELISA results using pooled 'meta-specificity' versus concomitant use of two highly specific assaysdvery similar seroprevalence estimates for late April 2020 were determined (0.93% versus 0.87%). Slovenian seroprevalence in late April 2020 was compatible with population-based seroprevalence estimates for Iceland [7] , the Faroe Islands [12] , India [11] and China [17] , and substantially lower than those recorded in countries heavily affected by the first COVID-19 epidemic wave [4,8,10,14e16] .",

            "text": "In contrast to the first epidemic wave, Slovenia was one of the countries most affected in the second epidemic wave, with currently the third-worst COVID-19-related cumulative mortality globally (https://origin-coronavirus.jhu.edu/). With lessons learned during first-round testing, second-round specimens were also tested with the Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S combination, and all positives were tested further by NT. However, other methodological and logistic challenges arose. As shown in Fig. 1 , second-round specimens were collected at the turning point of the second epidemic wavedduring the collection period, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country increased 3.6fold, from 13 675 to 48 837. In addition, several study participants were either isolated or quarantined. All of these extended the sample collection period over 25 days and resulted in non-random sampling collection order (participants with COVID-19-compatible symptoms/signs were tested later because of logistical issues). Consequently, the seroprevalence estimate for the second round could not be calculated as point prevalence, but we had to present the results as the period (see Supplementary material, item S6). As a result, the seroprevalence estimates for October/November 2020 were presented as the upper bound of seroprevalence 14 days before the sample collection starting date and the lower bound of seroprevalence at the end of the sample collection period because: (a) the sensitivity of the serological assays correlates with the time that elapsed between exposure and testing, (b) sample collection was performed during epidemic exponential growth and (c) in contrast to the first round, the second round was not accompanied with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. In comparison to the first round, concomitant use of Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S was even more beneficial in the second round not only to secure high specificity but also to increase net sensitivity by capturing the participants with an anti-S-only or anti-N-only early convalescent response [31e33].",

However, the recent study that followed a large cohort of medical workers with the Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S combination showed the persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in all participants up to 6 months [31] . We strongly believe that all first-round anti-SARS-CoV-2-positive participants were also captured by the Elecsys-N/ Elecsys-S combination in their second-round samples and that a risk of 6-month 'seroreversion' when using the Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S combination is negligible. An additional important inherited limitation of all seroprevalence surveys is that some individuals remain seronegative post-infection, as evidenced by the detection of memory T-cell SARS-CoV-2 responses in the absence of antibodies [34, 35] .",

Significant logistical and methodological challenges accompanied both study rounds with several important lessons learned, including (but not limited to) the need for caution when relying on assays' evaluation data generated by manufacturers, the importance of manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments and early data sharing through peer-reviewed literature, the need for concomitant use of two highly specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in seroprevalence surveys conducted in both low-prevalence settings and during epidemic exponential growth, and the power and flexibility of the Bayesian approach for overcoming methodological challenges arising in seroprevalence surveys of emerging pathogens.",
