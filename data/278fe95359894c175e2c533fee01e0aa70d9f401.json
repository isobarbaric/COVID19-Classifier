The impacts of this transition cannot, however, be studied only at the educational level, as it consists of a broader social shift with multidomain repercussions. In this paper, we use the CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product evaluations) to further investigate interrelations among the context, input and process elements of ERL during the first wave of COVID-19, as the second wave presses towards reconfining. A correlation analysis of 46 variables, based students' responses (N=360) to a closed-ended questionnaire shows the crucial importance of motivation and engagement in online classes, as learning enablers or constrainers. These also shape the students' perception of the role that online classes play in helping them to stay more positive during ERL.",

            "text": "In March 2020, the world moved from traditional classes to what was coined as ERL (Emergency Remote Teaching / Learning / Instruction). The urgent and unplanned transition to fully remote teaching posed real challenges to all actors involved in the process, requiring immediate and unprecedented use of technologies, in particular in education. The impacts of this transition cannot, however, be studied only at the educational level, as it consists of a broader social shift with multilevel repercussions. In this paper, we use the CIPP model -Context, Input, Process and Product evaluations [1] to reflect on the circumstances and impact of the Emergency Remote Learning. The context assesses needs, problems, assets, and opportunities, as well as relevant contextual conditions and dynamics (e.g., institutional, social, financial, and governmental aspects). The input evaluation focus on how it should be done and assesses competing strategies and the work plans and budgets of the selected approach (e.g, technology infrastructure, software, faculty support, faculty professional develop-ment, learning resources such as access to libraries). The process evaluation considers if the program is being done and consists of monitoring, documenting, assessing, and reporting on the implementation of plans (e.g., how processes can be adapted to this new reality, quality of teaching and learning). Finally, the product evaluation sees if the program succeeded and it identifies and assesses costs and outcomesintended and unintended short term and long term (e.g., course completion rates, aggregated grade analyses, feedback). According to Hodges [2] , the \"Evaluation of ERT should be more focused on the context, input, and process elements than product (learning)\". The author explains that they \"are not advocating for no evaluation of whether or not learning occurred, or to what extent it occurred, but simply stressing that the urgency of ERT and all that will take to make it happen in a short time frame will be the most critical elements to evaluate during this crisis\". As such, in previous research, we focused on reporting on the overall evaluation according to six proposed dimensions. In this paper, we focus on the CIPP model's context, input and process elements concerning in Northern Portugal. As of October 2020, with the rise of the second wave of COVID-19, and the pressure to reconfine, we further investigate which are the most impactful variables of these CIPP Model elements, and how they interrelate, in order to obtain in-depth knowledge to foster current strategies being devised by teachers and Higher Education Institutions.",

It could also have been caused by the gradually increasing distance between people resulting from the quarantine that affected all students and in particular, those staying far from home as they were not only worried about their health, safety, and education but they also had concerns for the wellbeing of their families. Furthermore, anxiety disorders are more likely to occur and worsen in the absence of interpersonal communication [9, 10] , which was the case. The significant shortage of masks and disinfectants during the first wave, the overwhelming and sensational news headlines, and erroneous news reports also contributed to this effect [11] .",

Of course, it is possible to use a simple online content delivery which can be quick and inexpensive, although it can be confusing and not robust. This means it is essential to build a whole ecosystem integrating all sorts of instruction in which the planning of the design process is key [2] . Issues of online design must be taken into consideration as well. In a period of crisis and crisis response, there is an increased risk of diminishing the quality of the courses delivered. If there was already a stigma concerning the online instruction, with people thinking it has lower quality, this prejudice might be exacerbated with this quick move online, without the proper preparation of all the key actors involved. Usually, a full-course development project can take months when done correctly. The need to \"just get it online\" is in direct contradiction to the time and effort generally dedicated to developing quality education.",

According to the results of the survey, which compared the perspectives of teachers and students, for faculty, the remote teaching and learning experience was much more positive to students. During and after the lockdown, they say they learn better in traditional classes and that ERL was less effective [22] . They claimed to have missed discussions, engagement, and interaction. Another important issue relies on providing feedback to students. As stated, \"Anything over a week after the students submit their work may be too long\" [21] . Equity and inclusion are also relevant for the success of online instruction, as stated by Jebsen \"The intent is to improve access to learning more equally while treating everyone equitably\" [23] .",

'Strong' and 'moderate' correlations were found among 46 variables (Table 1) , which are considered as the most impactful ones among the previous set. For all cases, the correlations among the pairs of variables are significant as p < .001. An undirected network of correlations was built (Fig 1.) and is composed of 46 nodes (variables) and 96 edges (correlations). The nodes size is ranked by total degree, i.e., the bigger the node (variable), the higher number of correlations with other variables (nodes). The edges thickness is ranked and labelled with the correlation coefficient (rs). Nodes colours are partitioned according to the network modularity, and as observed, nine clusters were created. The pragmatic consistency of the clusters of variables was verified by the researchers and the clusters were then labelled according to their dominant logic.

Students that were motivated and engaged showed a more positive attitude towards the ERL while those that were less motivated showed worst results. This is in line with the literature as authors [2] stress the importance of the context, in particular in unusual circumstances, which is the case. Additionally, it is also stressed that it is vital to learn how to develop empathy online as this contributes to involve all the actors in the learning process. Results also show that there is here some ground for future research, in particular concerning how to involve and engage students in online classes and virtual rooms as these are fundamental factors in the learning process.",
