J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 ABSTRACT Objective: To investigate the duration and peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding as infectivity markers for determining the isolation period. Methods: In total, 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. Results: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer was the time to negative conversion. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 Conclusions: The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms. Different isolation policies should be applied depending on disease severity. for collecting clinical data. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Zhu J, Guo J, Xu Y, Chen X.

Although a positive RT-PCR result may not necessarily mean that a person is infectious, a lower Ct value (inversely related J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to the viral load) could indicate a higher viral load and consequently, higher infectivity.",

IMC is classified as a group B medical institution that treats patients aged 15-65 years with underlying diseases or patients aged > 65 years without underlying diseases. Therefore, most of our study participants were middle-aged patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The patients' demographic information and clinical data, including data on initially observed signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, sputum production, and headache), comorbidities, and onset date of the first symptom, were collected at hospital admission.",

Clinical severity was classified on an eight-category ordinal scale developed by Sung et al. (2020) , a modified version of the scale developed by Marshall et al. (2020) . In this study, clinical severity scores were grouped into three categories: \"mild,\" defined as scores 1-2 (without limitation of daily activities or with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f limitation of daily activities but without a need for supplemental oxygen therapy); \"moderate,\" defined as scores 3-4 (with a need for supplemental oxygen therapy); and \"severe,\" defined as scores 5-8 (with a need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation or death). By using the daily clinical data recorded for each patient, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of clinical symptoms (i.e., from the initial symptom onset to the last symptom manifestation), real-time RT-PCR positivity (i.e., from the first positive RT-PCR result to the first and second negative results of two consecutive RT-PCR tests), and hospitalization (i.e., from diagnosis or hospital admission to discharge) were calculated.",
