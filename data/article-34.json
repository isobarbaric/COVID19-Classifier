            "text": "The world is experiencing a global demographic transition of accelerated aging, derived from the decline in both fertility and mortality rates (The Lancet Healthy Longevity, 2021). Colombia is not the exception to this rule with the aggravating circumstance that the population ages with greater social inequality, inequity in healthcare services, and poverty (SABE Colombia, 2015) . Various sources estimate that by 2050, 80% of older people will live in low-income households and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that the growth rate of the older population will exceed that of high-income countries (World Health Organization WHO, 2018) . Colombia has experienced a significant decrease in its mortality levels in the last 70 years as a consequence of profound demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural transformations. All of this has had an unprecedented impact on increasing life expectancy. In the middle of the last century, life expectancy at birth in the region was 51.4 years; in the period between 2015 and 2020, it reached 75.2 years (Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL), 2021)."

But the country was not prepared for the threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the high fatality in the older persons due to COVID-19, which has evidenced an alarming situation: the Colombian health system is not prepared for an aging population (Guti\u00e9rrez Cortes & Tovar, 2021) . Aging populations will place a high demand for medical care and specialized health personnel for the older adult. As we recently showed, in the country, we do not have the number of geriatricians necessary to meet the growing needs of the older population (Guti\u00e9rrez Cortes & Tovar, 2021) ."

Another threat that affects the older population in Colombia is the poverty and the inequity in health and social services as mentioned previously, generating greater lethality in this population group both in infectious diseases and in chronic non-communicable diseases, which could confirm that we are facing a syndemic in the country rather than a COVID-19 pandemic; hence, the importance of having a comprehensive care approach to the aging population, taking into account the social determinants that impact healthy aging ."

Furthermore, this age group has the highest burden of comorbidities where an average of three comorbidities was reported (SABE Colombia, 2015) , which could explain the increased number of deaths per million inhabitants."

But with less than 10% of geriatricians than required (116/ 1400) (Guti\u00e9rrez Cortes & Tovar, 2021) , without their care levels for the older adults, and given that to date there are no more than five specific geriatric hospital units throughout the country, and that a large number of older people continue to be managed in general wards without specific training in the specialty, we will continue to add deaths in the country."
