Hospitals across the world are reformed to meet the growing requirement to manage patients with respiratory and flu-like illness. There is an acute shortage of healthcare workers due to reallocation and quarantine. There is a great risk for the cancer patients to contact the virus in the healthcare facility and also patients who are carriers and are a risk to the healthcare community during treatment."

Prior online appointments should be encouraged to prevent crowding at registration counters. Investigation facilities should be fast tracked to avoid long waiting queues. Triaging of the patients should be done based on the survival benefit of interventions and prognosis into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Tumor board meetings should be held through web conferences. All newly diagnosed cases should preferably be offered neoadjuvant therapy unless contraindicated. It is evident that hormone receptor-positive tumors respond well to neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and have the advantage of not causing any bone marrow suppression with better side effect profile when compared with chemotherapy with comparable conversion rates. Hormonal therapy also has the advantage that patients can be safely followed on telemedicine consultation and hence preferred during this pandemic. Trastuzumab can be started safely as it has not shown any detrimental effects on the immune system. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy in breast carcinoma has also shown promising results in various studies [1] and can be used as an alternative to chemotherapy during this pandemic."

All operation theater staff must wear proper personal protective equipment while operating. Operative procedures should be simple without any complex reconstructive procedures. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol should be followed to minimize hospital stay in the postoperative period. However, postoperative complications should be dealt immediately in the healthcare facility without any delay."
