As a result, global cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have increased at an unprecedented rate [2] . The omicron variant can spread easily in individuals even if they have completed their vaccination course. Several mutations in the omicron variant are expected to enable the virus to evade the immune system established by vaccination, resulting in increased infectivity [3, 4] . In addition, a decrease in immunity elicited by vaccines over time, namely waning immunity, may play an important role in the omicron variant's spread [5] . However, vaccines remain effective in protecting against severe diseases caused by the omicron variant, although the effectiveness may have decreased in the omicron variant rather than in previous variants [6] . Understanding the extent of vaccine effectiveness on clinical protection in patients with breakthrough infection caused by the omicron variant is needed to take measures to minimise the damage from the current pandemic.",

According to several reports, the omicron variant virus presumably has weakened virulence, which is related to reduced severity, hospitalisation, and mortality [7, 8] . However, the recent explosive increase in the number of omicron variant infections has increased the total number of deaths, and the omicron's spread has not slowed as of 28 February 2022. In this situation, to efficiently use limited medical resources, it is important to predict which patients will go through an unfavourable clinical course and put concentrated efforts into them.",

We also found similar findings in omicron variant infections compared with delta variant infections (Table 1) . However, in breakthrough infections caused by delta and omicron variants, the variant type was not associated with the occurrence of specific signs observed in this study, except for pneumonia (Table 2) . We assume that our findings are owing to the reduced effectiveness of vaccines against omicron variants. Indeed, the omicron variant has multiple mutations that enable evasion of the vaccine-induced immune system [19, 20] We found differences in the viral kinetics among vaccinated patients with a variety of antibody levels. The viral load decline rate was positively correlated with antibody levels. In All rights reserved.

However, none of the participants had a previous infection, although it relied on self-reporting. Furthermore, our findings were robust in a sensitivity analysis involving patients who tested antibody levels within 3 or 5 days of symptom onset or diagnosis. Second, since our study hospital has specific criteria for admission, which allowed only patients with mild to moderate severity to be admitted, we could not investigate the effects of antibody levels on outcomes such as moving to the severe phase (n=2) or death (n=0). Therefore, further studies involving a larger number of patients with a wide range of disease severity are warranted. Third, the diagnosis of pneumonia in this study was based on chest radiographic findings. Chest radiography is limited in its ability to detect subtle pneumonia. Furthermore, we did not routinely perform follow-up chest radiography if the initial test did not report abnormal findings and if the patient's condition did not change.",

We highlight the need for concentrated efforts to monitor patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have conditions related to poor antibody response to vaccination (e.g. immunocompromised status) or waning immunity after vaccination (e.g. adenoviral vector-based vaccine) since they are more likely to undergo an unfavourable disease course.",

The relationship between antibody levels and Ct values was confirmed using a generalised linear model. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.1.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Results A total of 187 patients were admitted to Yongin Severance Hospital between 11 December 2021 and 10 February 2022. Of these, 172 patients underwent tests for SARS-CoV-2 variant type assay. Results of the assay revealed that 79 patients were infected with the delta variant, 82 with the omicron variant, and seven with the undetermined type. There were no cases of reinfection. According to the inclusion criteria for analyses using antibody levels, 106 patients who underwent antibody testing within a defined period were selected from 111 vaccinated patients: 39 with delta variant infections and 67 with omicron variant infections (Figure 1A). Antibody levels were tested at a median of 4 days (IQR 2-6) of symptom onset or diagnosis, and variant-type assays were performed at 4 days (IQR 3-5) after the initial diagnosis (Figure 1B). Of the 161 patients who had the delta or omicron variant infection, 85 (53 %) were women, and the mean age was 54.5 (\u00b118.9) years. Patients with omicron variant infection were younger than those with delta variant infection (p=0.017). The proportion of female patients, distribution of body mass index, frequency of immunocompromised status, or CCI \u22653 were similar among patients with delta and omicron variant infections. Although patients with delta variant infection were more frequently asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (p=0.01), thosewith an omicron variant infection had lower occurrence rates of pneumonia (p<0.001) andAll rights reserved.
