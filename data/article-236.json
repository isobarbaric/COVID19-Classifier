            "text": "In the case of Nigeria, the already troubled small and medium business (SME) sector and branding of small businesses require attention. Departing from the strict marketing perspective it is typically understood, branding is construed as a function of the overall state of a society in this article. As such, three foundational requirements, namely, technological, socio-economic, and educational imperatives, are identified as society wide policies that must be re-imagined and implemented consistently for SMEs in Nigeria to have strong basis for their branding as well as their emergence as competitive brands post Covid-19. A wide range of secondary sources such as reports, articles in the field of marketing, branding and small business branding, and contemporary global and national developments are integrated in advancing the position of this article."

As such, three foundational requirements, namely, technological, socio-economic, and educational imperatives, are identified as society wide policies that must be re-imagined and implemented consistently for SMEs in Nigeria to have strong basis for their branding as well as their emergence as competitive brands post Covid-19. A wide range of secondary sources such as reports, articles in the field of marketing, branding and small business branding, and contemporary global and national developments are integrated in advancing the position of this article."

Some such as economic growth, terrorism, conflicts, narcotics and drug related crimes, climate change, migration, and political dynamics are enduring; others such as artificial intelligence, big data and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and calculated dis/mis information on social media are relatively nascent. To a lesser or greater degree, these topics left the whole of humanity hung gingerly on a slope gyrating between maintaining the status quo, caution and uncertainty. Then the Corona virus pandemic, or Covid-19, struck: suddenly our collective existence is threatened, even misgivings and contentions between States were relegated to the background as countries and organizations collaborated to mitigate the consequences on the socio-economic fabric of the world. Post Covid-19, experts and think-tanks have made numerous predictions that point to intense decimation of jobs due to business failures resulting in increased global unemployment and poverty."

Also, in terms of ease of doing business, Nigeria currently ranks 131 out of 190 countries (World Bank Group, 2020), a significant 15-notch improvement from the previous 146 position. All of these suggest that the resource rich country is faring well. Ironically, 40% of Nigerians live in poverty (National Bureau of Statistics, 2020) earning the country the unenviable title of poverty capital of the world (Brookings Institution, 2019). Food inflation has risen steadily since the imposition of stringent border controls and continues the upward trajectory as Covid-19 bites harder. In order to break from the strain of unemployment and poverty, the opinion exist that one needs a \"side hussle\": enter SMEs into the scene. From this perspective, SMEs are a means to an endsubsistence. For a sector regarded as a major economic backbone critical to the economic recovery plans of government (Ministry of Budget and National Planning, 2017), the foregoing is not a good picture.

This is the reality of most Nigerian SMEs and accounts for why small business branding in the country appears set for continued malaise.

The message is simple: adapt to appreciably function within the dynamics of the times and remain competitively relevant or crumble. This is because the pandemic has given traction to a technological deterministic necessity for all firms such that the extent to which technology is integrated into the business model for the purpose of facilitating its processes and driving value delivery will become a major aspect that determines innovative, competitive, and distinctive brands. In the absence of, at least, adoption of minimum innovative technologies in line with the technology imperative of the times, the relevance of a SME as a competitive brand cannot be guaranteed. This necessity echoes the Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) (see Vargo & Lusch, 2007) where specialized competencies comprising knowledge and skills are construed as the main factors firms require for anchoring their overall processes, both internally and externally. The correlation is clear as per Covid-19 accelerated technological determinism and SME branding in Nigeria. Either the SMEs realize the changing landscape and its imperatives, have and deploy requisite knowledge and skills to stay competitive or, remain a nondescript, struggling venture or, at worst, collapse. The main challenges that Nigeria faces concern inadequate infrastructure, resulting in unreliable power and poor internet connections. We are confident that if infrastructure is improved, Nigerian founders will be able to move forward for the benefit of their country and local economy (Startupblink, 2020: 143) However, the technological imperative will pose a major challenge in terms of its effect on jobs. In a society like Nigeria where most small businesses still operate the brick and mortar model, many jobs will be lost and livelihoods compromised as SMEs embrace, for example, automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and e-commerce for their business operations. Jobs once done physically, perhaps by more than one person, will be eliminated and individuals rendered redundant."

The ban led to the wasteful demise of innovative SME brands like Gokada and Oride, brands redefining the face of commercial motorbike transportation in the city through ride hailing technology.

The latter concern is critical because currently, SMEs are associated with urban areas to the detriment of rural locations whose business engagements are typically no more than micro or subsistence holdings.

Like other facets of the Nigerian society, the education sector has been in the doldrums for decades crippled by incessant industrial actions, inadequate funding, internal administrative bickering, and political meddling to mention a few. As a result, calls for a total reform of the education sector are persistent and rife. Such reform must necessarily include the pedagogy of branding specifically. Until the 20th Century, branding was studied and researched exclusively from the perspective of large firms (Abimbola & Kocak, 2007; Centeno, Hart, & Dinnie, 2013; Spence & Essoussi, 2010) ."

If Nigerian SMEs must emerge as strong brands, it is necessary to have a deliberate and small business tailored pedagogic policy that teaches individuals the relevance of strategic marketing and branding in transforming their small business into distinctive and competitive going concern. In truth some institutions of higher learning, professional associations, government agencies and private organizations offer entrepreneurship training but there is a fundamental flaw in its execution: it is uncoordinated as a matter of policy and delivered on a need-basis for those who indicate interest and/or whose discipline mandates it."

Only a tailored and strategic national entrepreneurship education policy instilled in people from a young age and present at all stages of education is capable of promoting a strong entrepreneurial culture. Post Covid-19, entrepreneurship education has to be re-imagined in terms of teaching that integrates conventional principles with novelty and provides application frameworks that matches local context with global trends. This is the task of what Boyer (1990) called scholarship of teaching, integration and application."

            "text": "Nigerian SMEs have the potential to be strong brands because the country is immensely endowed with human capital and natural resources. Ironically, that same potential is the albatross confronting SMEs in the country not because \"potential\" is undesirable, but because the intrinsic prospect has not been properly managed and harnessed making it recessive. Post Covid-19 the DNA of business, in a world already at the threshold of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, will mutate into a technology and innovation core upon which brand distinction will also depend. As this ideological shift expands its reach, innovative firms will adapt fast, be more dominant and strengthen their brand profile and status. Less innovative and laggard firms will battle to stay alive sinking slowly into oblivion or get acquired by innovative ones. Currently, SMEs in Nigeria can be categorized as mainly laggard firms at the mercy of relentless and unstoppable tide of global change. They need help to emerge as strong, competitive brands. That help is a matter of government led, far-reaching and fundamental re-engineering of socio-economic and educational policies, both of which are critical to the realization of the post Covid-19 technological imperative for business. In the absence of this, the competitiveness and branding of Nigerian SMEs does not look bright."

The government should sensitize people on the use of technology so as to suppress the effect of the pandemic.Whereas SMEs do need to be technologically savvy and compliant, reducing the role of government to mere sensitization on the importance of technology in business is unfair to entrepreneurs and small business owners and/or managers. In the case of Nigeria where government has failed to provide essential infrastructures such as constant electricity supply and good road networks, the odds of success are already stacked against SMEs.
