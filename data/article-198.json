J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 ABSTRACT Objective: To investigate the duration and peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding as infectivity markers for determining the isolation period. Methods: In total, 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. Results: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer was the time to negative conversion. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 Conclusions: The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms. Different isolation policies should be applied depending on disease severity. for collecting clinical data. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Zhu J, Guo J, Xu Y, Chen X.

Currently, the diagnostic testing and isolation of COVID-19 patients depend on the result of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, the result (positive or negative) of which is interpreted using the cycle threshold (Ct) value. Although a positive RT-PCR result may not necessarily mean that a person is infectious, a lower Ct value (inversely related J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to the viral load) could indicate a higher viral load and consequently, higher infectivity."

Clinical severity was classified on an eight-category ordinal scale developed by Sung et al. (2020) , a modified version of the scale developed by Marshall et al. (2020) .

This represents a reasonably large amount of data contributing to evidence on the early period of the disease course. This was possible because the median duration from symptom onset to hospital admission was only 2 days, which seems to be the result of aggressive testing and quarantine, as mentioned above."

The viral load of COVID-19 patients peaked in the first few days (2-4 days) after symptom onset and continued to decrease until days 10-15 of the illness. Viral loads represented by Ct values could be used for monitoring clinical progression and for making decisions regarding intervention. Although the symptombased strategy, rather than the previous laboratory-based strategy, is recommended for deciding whether to discontinue the isolation of COVID-19 patients, assessing the viral load J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f at any point of the disease course could provide necessary evidence when determining the need for intervention or prolonged hospitalization."
