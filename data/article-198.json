J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 ABSTRACT Objective: To investigate the duration and peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding as infectivity markers for determining the isolation period. Methods: In total, 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. Results: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer was the time to negative conversion. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 Conclusions: The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms. Different isolation policies should be applied depending on disease severity. for collecting clinical data. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Zhu J, Guo J, Xu Y, Chen X.

Although a positive RT-PCR result may not necessarily mean that a person is infectious, a lower Ct value (inversely related J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to the viral load) could indicate a higher viral load and consequently, higher infectivity."

Clinical severity was classified on an eight-category ordinal scale developed by Sung et al. (2020) , a modified version of the scale developed by Marshall et al. (2020) . In this study, clinical severity scores were grouped into three categories: \"mild,\" defined as scores 1-2 (without limitation of daily activities or with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f limitation of daily activities but without a need for supplemental oxygen therapy); \"moderate,\" defined as scores 3-4 (with a need for supplemental oxygen therapy); and \"severe,\" defined as scores 5-8 (with a need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation or death). By using the daily clinical data recorded for each patient, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of clinical symptoms (i.e., from the initial symptom onset to the last symptom manifestation), real-time RT-PCR positivity (i.e., from the first positive RT-PCR result to the first and second negative results of two consecutive RT-PCR tests), and hospitalization (i.e., from diagnosis or hospital admission to discharge) were calculated."

Our findings confirmed that viral loads from respiratory specimens peaked at 4 days after symptom onset, showed a rapid decrease, and stopped significantly decreasing beyond day 10 for URT specimens and day 15 for LRT specimens."
