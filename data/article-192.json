CAs accept as input natural language as speech, text, or video; in addition, they may receive input from several different sensors. CAs are required to process the input and provide relevant advice or feedback in a form of text or speech or by manipulating a physical or a virtual body. Some CAs are capable of taking specific actions either in the real world or in the virtual world. Most CAs use natural-language processing to understand and generate speech, and some may also have engagement and personalization abilities. The rapidly growing abilities introduced by modern machine learning techniques facilitate the development of CAs capable of carrying out meaningful conversations with humans, learning to generate better and more relevant responses, expanding their knowledge-base, and performing actions beneficial to their users."

Furthermore, they present the general architecture of modern chatbots while also mentioning the main platforms they were created for. In another study, Nuruzzaman et al. [6] present a survey on commonly used chatbots and the underlying techniques. They focus on response-generating chatbots. In this category, the various response models can be categorized into four groups: template-based, generative, retrieval-based, and search engines. They compare the 11 most-popular chatbot application systems and present the similarities, differences, and limitations. They conclude that despite recent technological advances, chatbots conversing in a human-like manner are still hard to achieve."

They emphasize that \"big data\" available from conversations on social media can be useful in building data-driven, open-domain CAs capable of responding to nearly any query. They further state that deep learning technologies can be used to leverage the massive amount of data to advance CAs from different perspectives. Gao et al. [9] concentrate on deep learning based CAs. They group the conversational agents into three categories: question-answering agents, task-oriented dialogue agents, and chatbots. For each category, they present a review of state-of-the-art neural approaches, draw the connection between neural and traditional approaches, and discuss the progress that has been made and challenges still being faced using specific systems and models as case studies."

Three dimensions are related to CAs: the mode of communication, the context, and embodiment; and the other two dimensions are related to IS: the theory type and the research method. Wolff et al. [11] define a set of criteria to categorize chatbot applications. They review 52 articles describing chatbots. Most of the articles focus on customer-support chatbots, e.g., chatbots used to acquire information on specific services or products. In this article, we provide an overview of the concepts and building blocks of CAs and categorized them according to their abilities as well as the main domains of application. We emphasize the challenges and issues related to CA development for each domain while describing the tools and datasets useful for the development and evaluation of CAs of different categories. Finally, we provide some thoughts and directions for future studies and introduce domains that may benefit from conversational agents. For each of the topics in this survey, we focus on studies from the recent five years, though we also include earlier seminal studies as well as classical evaluation methods. In addition, the datasets provided in Section 8 include any relevant dataset that we found and are not limited to recent datasets."

Masche and Le [16] categorize conversational systems into chatbots and dialogue systems. According to their definition, chatbots are systems mainly based on pattern matching, while dialogue systems are based on theoretically motivated techniques that enable conversations. Nimavat and Champaneria [17] distinguish between four criteria that can be used to classify chatbots: the knowledge domain, the type of service provided, the chatbot goal, and the the response-generation method. They define conversational bots as bots that talk to the user like another human being, in an open domain. It is worth noting that due to the ambiguity in the related terms and definitions, and the lack of a commonly agreed upon standard on the meaning of chatbot, the Alexa prize competition, set up with the goal of furthering conversational AI, uses the term socialbot to describe the conversational agents. These agents are intended to interact on a range of open-domain conversational topics [18] ."

To properly define CA, the more general concept of dialogue systems is introduced first. A dialogue system is a human-computer interaction system that uses natural language to communicate with the user. A conversational agent is a dialogue system that can also understand and generate natural language content, using text, voice, or hand gestures, such as sign language. Thus, to be categorized as CA, the condition is, according to our definition, being able to understand and produce sentences CAs can also be classified according to their effector capabilities and actions. Communication-only agents merely communicate with a user and do not execute any action, e.g., ELIZA [19] , Cleverbot [21, 22] or CAs used only to answer questions. Other CAs, known as virtual or personal assistants, e.g., Alexa [23] , are capable of executing physical or virtual actions, such as turning on an AC or booking a flight (see Figure 2 )."

Goal-oriented CAs are also task-oriented dialogue systems [24] and are referred to as taskbots according to the Alexa Prize competition [25] .

(c) Social-supporting agents can support patients in medical conditions or support students in the learning process.

(d) History database: used to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations. (e) Markov Chain: enables probabilistic-based responses of chatbots."

The taxonomy consists of eleven dimensions and three archetypes, which can be used by practitioners in the design stages of CA. Lokman and Ameedeen [33] categorize modern chatbot design into the following elements: domain knowledge, response generation (retrieval or generative), text processing (vector embedding or Latin alphabet), and machine learning (ML) (mostly using neural networks). The various components described in this section enable the creation of CAs that are able to communicate with humans through an appropriate textual interface. In the next section, these technologies are also used for other types of CAs, such as voice-based CAs."

A voice-based virtual agent may extract additional nonverbal information from the user audio, such as the user's emotional state, e.g., whether the user is being sarcastic, dramatic, decisive, or trying to deceive the system.

Pattern matching may fail to answer the user query when the query is composed of words that do not match any pattern. Therefore, when the query is grammatically incorrect, the patternmatching mechanism will fail. To overcome these limitations, Agostaro et al. developed LSA-bot [50] , which is a chatbot based on latent semantic analysis (LSA). LSA applies statistical computations to a large corpus of text to extract and represent the meaning of words. LSA-bot uses LSA to map its knowledge base into a conceptual space. The user input is mapped into the same conceptual space, allowing LSA-bot to find an appropriate response."

In their study, Clark et al. present the results of semi-structured interviews on how people view the conversation between humans and CAs. They found that several social features reported as crucial in human-human conversation, such as understanding and common ground, trust, active listenership, and humor, are not listed as required for human-CA conversations. CA conversations are described almost exclusively by transactional and utilitarian terms. However, this view of CAs is not satisfactory in domains that require the user to engage and form an emotional bond with the CA."

The focus is on the following aspects: emotional issues, CA personality, and adaptation to the taste and needs of the user."

Affective objectives can be augmented in the cross-entropy loss function to generate additional emotional responses. Finally, the CA can be guided to search for effective responses during decoding.

In their experiment, participants were randomly assigned to racial-mirroring ECAs, non-mirroring ECAs, or control groups. After interacting with the ECA, participants completed a survey assessing their perception and evaluation of the agent. Liao and He demonstrated that racial mirroring has a positive influence on the user's perceived interpersonal closeness with the agent; the participants interacting with mirroring ECAs reported a higher level of satisfaction, a higher desire to continue interacting with the agent, and predicted a closer future relationship. In addition, people were significantly more likely to select same-race agent personas when they were given an opportunity to customize the ECA. Go and Sundar [117] tested the distinct and combined effects of three types of cues that potentially enhance the humanness of chat agents: human-like visual cues, the use of human names or identities, and the use of human language. For these three factors, the authors examined how interactions among these cues influence psychological, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes. Their experimental results indicate that CA interactivity is an important factor in determining psychological, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes, while the identity cue turns out to be a key factor in eliciting certain expectations regarding CA's performance in conversation. However, message interactivity can compensate for the impersonal CA nature."

They found that CA responsiveness increases socially desirable responses to sensitive questions. Figure 8 presents an overview of the human-related issues discussed in this section. Each challenge is associated with the appropriate CA component expected to assume the most responsibility for that challenge. Understanding the user's emotional state is mostly a challenge of the ASR, NLU, and perception components; the dialogue manager decides on how to provide an appropriate empathic response; the NLG, the gesture generator, and the text-to-speech components are responsible for generating empathy in verbal and non-verbal responses; the personality of the CA is expressed by the response generators including the text-generator, the speech-generator, and the gesture-generator components; and adaptation of the CA to the user's taste and needs is the responsibility of the dialogue manager.

People mistakenly believed ELIZA to be intelligent enough to comprehend a conversation, and some even became emotionally close to it.

These assistants constantly listen to hear a wakeup keyword, for example, \"Okay Google\", \"Alexa\", etc. Once a wake-up keyword is said, the assistant records the user's command and sends it to a server. The server translates the voice command to text by using an ASR component that parses the text using a parser and uses a natural-language-understanding component to determine the appropriate response or action to be taken by the assistant. For example, a simple query \"How are you today?\" may be followed by an answer \"I'm fine; thank you.\" A more-sophisticated question, such as \"How many types of mammals are there?\" may invoke a web-search that results in an answer such as \"There are 6000 different species of mammals\".

Misinterpretation may cause the virtual assistant to send an unwanted message. This may be harmful if the wrong message is sent to the wrong person or if a conversation is unintentionally recorded and sent to the wrong person. A virtual assistant may also enable the installation of malware. Misinterpretations may also cause the accidental turning off of the heating in a house with a baby, which may have devastating consequences.

There are few open-domain CAs that enable a lay user, rather than a programmer, to teach the agent to perform new action sequences or new responses. A learning-by-instruction agent (LIA) [132] uses a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) semantic parser to transform the semantics of each command to a few terms of primitive executable procedures that define the sensors and effectors of the agent. If the user gives the LIA a natural language command and if the LIA does not know how to execute the command, it will ask the user to explain how to realize the command through a sequence of natural-language steps. Once explained, the LIA can execute the command in the future. SUGILITE [133] is a programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that uses the Android's accessibility API to enable users to create automation on smartphones. In case the user specifies commands that SUGILITE does not know how to execute, it prompts the user to demonstrate the command, records the user's explanation, and automatically generates a script. Thus, SUGLITE can learn to execute an unrecognized command from a single demonstration."

They identified the different educational areas for which conversational agents have been developed, discussed common development techniques for pedagogical CAs, and also surveyed the communication strategies used by pedagogical CAs to interact with students. Some successful CAs that are recently used in the education domain are next described. Sara is a CA to assist students with learning [125] . Sara shows online video lectures and asks questions to ensure that the student has understood the lecture. It offers additional information and explanations if the student's responses are inaccurate. Sara interacts by voice and text when needed and has a voice-based input mode. It was demonstrated to improve learning in a programming task. A similar CA was developed by Paschoal et al. [138] to support software testing. AutoTutor [139] is a computer tutor that simulates the dialogues and strategies of a human tutor. It presents questions and problems from a curriculum script and, according to the learner's input, decides which action to perform next (e.g., providing a hint or moving on to the next problem). AutoTutor segments the input from the learner into a sequence of words, to assign alternative syntactic tags to words and the correct syntactic class to a word."

Each points to challenges in the healthcare area pertaining to efficiency, security, and privacy. CoachAI is a system that includes a chatbot and a machine-learning model to support a patient's health activities [168] . The chatbot collects data, sends reminders, and converses with users through text-based, simple, graphical elements to guide the user in healthrelated issues. The model is based on real-world data provided by a health clinic. The application provides the caregivers with insights on the users and assists with the tracking of user activities and their health conditions. Daily healthcare can be overwhelming for people with a chronic disease. Neerincx et al. [169] developed a social robot that helps children with diabetes. The robot supports the daily diabetes-management processes, namely, taking pills, shots, and body measurements by conversing with the child."

However, when chatbots disclose their identity before conversation, the purchase rates are reduced by more than 79.7%, and the conversation becomes shorter. Unfortunately, users do not always trust that CAs can provide the required support."

The advantages of human evaluation are clear, as humans can evaluate whether the CA responses seem appropriate and resemble responses. However, since human evaluation procedures are expensive, several automatic metrics have been proposed for the evaluation process. Unfortunately, due to the linguistic richness of natural languages and the wide variety of reasonable response options, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and meaningful evaluation when using automatic tools. Therefore, the ML approach tries to benefit from both approaches; on the one side, it is based on human evaluation, and, on the other side, it does not require new implicit costly evaluation methods for each new dialogue situation."

The human scores were collected using crowd workers that were shown a dialogue context and a candidate response and asked to rate the responses.

This enables creating a more flexible CA, which may talk with various users in different situations while using various interaction patterns. However, since CAs must consider the context to provide accurate responses, Serban et al. state that artificial datasets may have a caveat as they do not provide this context. It should be noted that since dialogues from movies can be too extreme and not reflect real-life dialogues, training and evaluating CAs based on them may lead to undesired behavior on the part of the CAs."

The leap in the progression of CA development is mostly due to recent advances in deeplearning and big-data technologies. These technologies have led to developments in several domains, such as ASR, NLU, NLG, and emotion-recognition given text, voice, or images, which, combined, allow the creation of a new generation of CAs, with human-like dialogue capabilities. The focus has been on describing the current state-of-the-art technologies developed for conversational agents and various practical applications in which these agents are in use. The survey includes several innovative uses of CAs in various practical areas, including general assistance, task performance, assistance in various social areas, and influence agents, designed to impact the business and public sectors. Figure 11 summarizes the information provided by the different illustration diagrams, which appear in this survey, categorized according to their aims."

With state-of-the-art CAs, the most advanced improve themselves based on new data. There are very few CAs, however, that allow humans to teach them additional knowledge and new capabilities or to provide them with the ability to direct their learning process. One of the few systems that can learn directly from humans is commonsense reasoning by instruction (CORGI) [247] . CORGI performs the commonsense reasoning required in applying if-then rules, by initiating a conversation with the user. Another example is Safebot [248] , which is taught new responses by the user to avoid learning inappropriate responses. Finally, the learning-by-instruction agent (LIA) [249] asks the user to explain how to execute a new command and associates a sequence of natural-language steps with it. Such systems enable users to fine-tune CAs to adapt them to personal needs and preferences. To further enhance such systems, additional appropriate protocols, algorithms, and rules should be developed and examined."

Considering the current state of the technology, any company, party, or ideological movement may develop a CA as a representative to describe its agenda and influence public opinion to garner support for its position. To what extent is such a practice considered moral? Situations where the CA identity is known or hidden should be distinguished, and situations where the company or party is represented by a single CA or by several, hundreds, or even thousands, to create a representation of mass support should be carefully considered and clarified. Surely, using a mass of CAs to influence public opinion seems to be dishonest and unfair, but where is the moral limit?"

Some of these applications are positive and even crucial, such as health support or social support; others can be beneficial to business and companies; and others should be monitored or even avoided for moral reasons.
