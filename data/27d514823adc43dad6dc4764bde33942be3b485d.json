Hence, we propose an application called MEDSHARE which is a web-based application that integrates the data from various sources and helps the patient to access all their health records in a single point of source. Apart just from the collection of data, this portal enables the process of diagnosis using Natural language processing. The process is carried out by fuzzy logic ruleset which is generated by using NLP packages. The resulted information is given to the SVM classifier which helps in the prediction of diseases resulting in 89% of accuracy and standing the best compared to other classifiers. Finally, the observations resulted are sent to the front end application and the concerned user mobile through text message in their own native language for which translation package is been used.",

These systems, however, are prone to a myriad of issues such as data quality, sparseness, ambiguous information, etc. Processing invalid or ambiguous information leads to faulty analytics of faulty predictions. In the healthcare field, faulty predictions may lead to a loss of life. Hence, a novel system that can identify chronic diseases accurately needs to be found. When considering chronic diseases it is one of the main threats to mankind and seems to be challenging to the healthcare systems found around the world. Also, when we consider population, it is rapidly expanding on a daily basis, which adds another issue. Given today's population, the population appears to exceed 21% by 2050.",

Automatic or remote access to medical information or diagnoses is becoming increasingly popular since it is more practicable, cost-effective, and reliable.

The development approach should be adaptable to portable devices, and a self-monitoring report in his/her local language with fundamental parameters Wu et al. 1990 ) in an understandable style should be enabled. Thus, implementing this type of application will involve patients in taking care of their health, resulting in the collection of a substantial quantity of health-related information. When bringing in this application, it seems that there are so many techniques that are used to collect health information. Wearable devices are used to monitor the heartbeat rate, pulse, and other health data regularly to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Similarly, additional future and advanced applications for health maintenance have raised the concept of self-monitoring as a practical option for patients. Thus, capturing all of this information aids in the accumulation of massive amounts of data, which are then used for a variety of prediction and analysis purposes (Bodenreider 2004; Ghasemzadeh et al. 2012; Ravikumar and Kavitha 2021; Walczak 2005) .",

The main disadvantage of focusing on this heterogeneous nature is that efficiency will be difficult to achieve because data utilization and transmission are the most important factors.

They don't exactly provide the same solution that we have proposed in this paper yet are still able to check the challenges that are present in this field and help to bring up collaborative healthcare data utilization. Main challenges are highlighted which include the utilization of data and integration further added feature will be the efficiency of data. Srivastava and Singh (2020) presented a Medibot technique to identify the user's symptoms with a 65% precision via NLP. Kandpal et al. (2020) presented a Contextual chatbot to offer healthcare services using deep learning. However, these applications can be only operated in the English language. Jungmann et al. (2020) presented an NLP technique to identify the patient suspected of urolithiasis by extracting the information automatically from the EHR. However, they haven't analyzed the performance of this model. Kaur et al. (2018) automatically extracted the Asthma Prediction Index(API) from the user's EHR via NLP to identify the patients that mark the API criterion. The API mainly denotes the risk factor for asthma patients. Zhong et al. (2019) utilized the NLP technique to identify pregnant women with suicidal behavior. However, when compared to the data obtained using diagnosis codes, the use of unstructured text revealed that there are 11 times as many pregnant women with suicidal behavior.",

            "text": "The deep learning methods (Shickel et al. 2017 ) are primarily focused and used so that knowledge can be extracted from the free unstructured text. These further prove they are exceptional and are mandatory in the region of information retrieval and also a large amount of unstructured data to be processed. Liu et al. (2019) proposed an ensemble of NLP systems for automatic phenotype extraction from clinical texts. They have evaluated the performance of their technique by analyzing generic phenotypic concepts and patient-specific phenotypic concepts. They created different types of ensemble architectures such as majority vote-based ensemble, training-based ensemble, union ensemble, MetaMapLite, MedLEE, and cTAKES. They mainly proved that integrating multiple ensemble NLP techniques can improve the performance and reproducibility of the results. However, the training model should be altered for each performance metric to reach certain objectives. Tvardik et al. (2018) evaluated the performance of the SYNODOS NLP solution in identifying healthcare-associated infections. Different medical fields such as adult intensive care unit, digestive surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery were involved in this study. The accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity value for their technique in identifying healthcare-associated infections is 84%, 83.9%, and 84.2% respectively. Solomon et al. (2021) used NLP for aortic stenosis identification and its severity calculation. The authors found that the validated NLP algorithm yielded more accuracy for the electrocardiography database than the diagnosis codes. The administrative diagnosis codes and the operating nature of the NLP algorithms in diagnosing aortic stenosis, however, have considerable discrepancies. Habib et al. (2021) presented a methodology known as AltibbiVec which is a neural-based word embedding model designed in the Arabic language for medical and healthcare applications. The AltibbiVec architecture identifies the appropriate and useful features from the thousands of data samples. They have used three different embedding models namely GloVe, fastText, and Word2Vec. Based on their results, the Word2Vec and fastText were more effective when compared to GloVe. However, their application requires abundant data for contextualized word representations. But in spite of having these many advantages the main challenge is the formatting process of healthcare records, keywords not available, use of so many punctuations, not correct parts of speech, spelling mistakes, etc. The use of linguistic analysis (Roberts 2017 ) finds tough as the text containing medical terms is difficult to interpret. Sometimes instead of full-text abbreviations being used it becomes even harder to come up with inference (Yu et al. 2020) . Hence due to this sometimes researchers find challenging in using NLP, especially for medical domains. To overcome these problems in our research we are proposing an application that helps in categorizing before coming to inference using fuzzy logic rules and word embedding technique. This technique also sends the prediction results to the users via an SMS in their native language because in India people do not always have an uninterrupted network connection.",

Hence our proposed application will help in collaborating all these data as a single unit. Figure 1 explains the workflow of the proposed methodology. The data integration technique along with its utilization can seem to be bound with each other.

Further, all providers giving data can be integrated and collected which proceeded with a heterogeneous process. After the heterogeneous data integration process is completed, the knowledge is extracted from the data using different techniques such as UMLS, WordNet, and disease ontology. The NLP extracts the crucial features for disease diagnosis and the results are given the SVM classifier and the fuzzy logic-based reasoning module. Using symptom extraction and keyword mapping, the fuzzy rule generation framework identifies the patients who are prone to multiple diseases. The SVM classifier classifies the disease of the patients based on the features extracted. The data visualization process helps the patients to witness the results and it can be finally used for the prediction of any disease in the near future.",

Hence based on the keywords each disease is taken as a separate class and is associated with objects which are the symptoms of that disease. After this process, relevant fuzzy rules are generated to consider multiple diseases that are possible for the same type of symptoms. The fuzzy logic system using weighted calculations is used. The process is carried out based on the priority of weightage given is considered. The rule is based on the IF-THEN statement that is Mamdani fuzzy logic model. The rules go like this ''If x1 is A1 and y1 is B1 then z1 is C1'' where A1, B1, C1 are considered to be the fuzzy sets. For the sample we take the dataset to be represented as l, containing n features and k samples. ",

The results are then multiplied by 2.5 to yield the final evaluation score. The scores above 80 were considered excellent, a score above 70 was considered good, and scores above 60 were considered okay and scores below 50 were considered bad. The results are shown in Fig. 17 , and the values obtained for the questions A1-A4 are very high which shows that the proposed application is easy to use, can be understood by laypeople, and the functionalities are well integrated. A higher value was obtained for question A4 which says that the proposed approach is easily understandable even by a layperson. A6 is the question that had a higher score regarding the complexity of the MEDSHARE application. Half of the candidates said that they need a little bit more practice to operate this application.",

            "text": "The healthcare records contain structure, unstructured data, and also other reports such as blood tests, sugar tests, etc. Hence the queries are collected from the users and information is retrieved from the available data and returned to the user in a structured manner. Some of the techniques added to this in NLP helps in providing additional support such as diagnosis. But combining all these features is still a challenging process as data integration needs to be carried out. The techniques can process a large amount of text data which can be converted to knowledge to access by the patients which are at times self-understanding. Eventhough the NLP systems for healthcare applications achieved multiple benefits, it often struggles in processing the heterogeneous data obtained from various medical institutions due to the presence of different languages. The symptoms present in different sublanguages often hinder performance. Based on our experimental outcomes, we can confirm that the usage of WordNet, UMLS, and Disease ontology has improved the information extraction process and increased the accuracy of the MEDSHARE application. Our proposed methodology offers optimal performance even when evaluated with noisy medical datasets. The performance of the proposed methodology is even higher than the state-of-art techniques such as SYNODOS NLP solution (Tvardik et al. 2018) ; AltibbiVec (Habib et al. 2021) , Deep learning (Shickel et al. et al. 2017) , Contextual Chatbot (Kandpal et al. (2020) , and NLP (Jungmann et al. 2020) . The contextual chatbot application is designed in the English language which is often complex to be used by laypeople. The performance of the automatic phenotype extraction approach proposed by Liu et al. (2019) often declined due to the size of the training sample used. To increase the performance of the classifier the size of the training samples needs to be increased. This problem exists for different state-of-art approaches proposed. The NLP technique proposed by Solomon et al. (2021) to identify the aortic stenosis patients often struggled with the patient-specific concept recognition task due to the missed follow-up visits and membership cancellation of the patients. The AltibbiVec proposed by Habib et al. (2021) is only applicable to large datasets to yield effective contextualized word representation outcomes. Based on these results we can observe the use of the NLP and Machine learning techniques is efficient for healthcare applications.",

The SVM classifier accurately predicts the disease of the patient. The fuzzy rule generation framework generates the appropriate rules to identify the different diseases with the same symptoms. The symptoms of malaria and COVID19 can sometimes collide and the same can be also applicable to diabetes and blood pressure. The proposed methodology has some limitations which are delineated below. The proposed work doesn't extract the patient's phenotypes which is valuable when it comes to patient-specific concept recognition tasks. In the future, we plan to overcome this issue using a majority voting ensemble technique. In some cases, a novel dataset with a low number of features is prone to the overfitting and curse of dimensionality problem which can also hinder real-time performance.",

Then using the SVM classifier the prediction process is said to have 89% of accuracy and seems to be proven highest when compared to the decision tree and Na\u00efve Bayes classifier. To make this application to be enhanced and for further betterment, additional features can be added such as mapping of doctors in case of emergencies, alert notifications when exceeding the threshold, and multiple language translation. In the future can be optimized by including ensemble methods for prediction purposes.",
