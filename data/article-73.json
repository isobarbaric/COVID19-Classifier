Its replication increases with age and is higher in males than females [8] , and has been demonstrated to be associated with the immune status of the host. Immunocompetent individuals display low and stable TTV DNA loads, typically under 10,000 copies/mL [9] , whereas immunocompromised patients, especially transplant patients, show much higher TTV DNA loads correlating with the intensity of their immunosuppression [10] . Low TTV DNA load, mirroring strong immune levels, is a marker of graft rejection risk [10, 11] in these populations, whereas high TTV DNA load, reflecting poor immunity, is associated with microbial infection occurrence [12] .",

TTV DNA load was measured using the TTV R-GENE\u00ae kit (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). This kit provides standards to generate a standard curve allowing to measure TTV DNA load values in copies/mL. TTV R-GENE\u00ae kit LLOD is 250 copies/mL. This kit also comprises a sensitivity control, with a low viral load around the LLOD, which was detected for all runs. RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV2 nucleic acid used primer and probe sequences targeting two regions on the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2 [15] . Assay sensitivity is around 10 copies/reaction. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was considered positive if at least one of the targets led to positive amplification. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were detected using the COVID-19 BSS IgG/IgM rapid test, Biosynex\u00ae [16] . Seroconversion was defined as the presence of specific antibodies (IgM and/or IgG). Rapid assay results were analysed as positive or negative, as well as in a semi-quantitative manner for IgG sample line intensity (see Supplementary)(16).",

Since COVID-19 severity and mortality rates have been associated to strong immune response and inflammation, we investigated whether plasma levels of TTV may predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Using a threshold of 700 copies/ml of TTV DNA load, we observed that severe cases were more frequent in patients with low TTV DNA load as early as the first week after symptom onset. This implies that in situations affecting or provoked by immunity changes, irrespective of age, TTV DNA load quickly adapts and can be a useful marker of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion occurred earlier in patients with low TTV DNA load -mirroring stronger immunity-which suggests a correlation between the intensity of global immunity and of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity.",

Here, we show that patients displaying low TTV DNA load and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia have a 12-fold higher risk of being admitted to the ICU in the following days. Low TTV DNA load and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia detection may be effective markers reflecting disease severity and poor outcome that could be conveniently used in clinical laboratory settings. These are non-invasive markers that could be measured as soon as COVID-19 diagnosis is made based on positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on respiratory samples. Specific soluble immunological markers such as IL-6 [20] or the IL-6/IFN-\u03b3 ratio [21] have been described and could be combined with TTV DNA load and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Lymphocyte count, CRP or procalcitonin levels have also been used as predictors of COVID-19 prognosis and have been suggested to be used in conjunction with each other as an overall \u00ab score \u00bb [22] [23] [24] [25] in the aim of reflecting different aspects of the immune response, while no marker reflecting the globality of the immune function had previously been investigated in the context of COVID-19. Indeed, due to its nature as an endogenous virus, the sole use of TTV DNA load may reflect the strength of the overall immune response. As a matter of fact, in solid organ transplantation, low TTV DNA loads have been shown to predict all types of graft rejection, whether its origin was cellular, humoral or mixed. However, while TTV DNA load is useful to estimate the overall intensity of the immune response, the interplay of the different elements of the immunity involved in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection still remain to be elucidated. Non-infected patients (SARS-CoV-2 negative controls) were not included in this study. Another limitation is the unavailability of pre-COVID-19 plasma samples to determine TTV levels and kinetics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Indeed, despite the retrospective nature of the study, analyzing these biological data at the time at which patients seek medical help and their association with disease outcome closely mimics the possible use of these markers in actual clinical practice. Prospective longitudinal studies on larger cohorts could strenghten these findings and define guidelines for the use of TTV DNA load in COVID-19 patients. ",

Distribution of severe COVID-19 cases according to TTV DNA load measured in the first or second week after symptom onset.
