These proteins also exist in fish, however, their roles in the innate immune response remain unknown. Here, we report a characterization of teleost IFITM1 from flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (PoIFITM1), which exhibits conserved structure characteristic of the IFITM family but comprises a relatively longer N-terminal region. The expression and promoter activity of PoIFITM1 are markedly induced by aquatic animal viruses: Rana grylio virus (RGV) and Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV). Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown demonstrate that PoI-FITM1 exhibits strong antiviral effects against both DNA virus (RGV) and RNA virus (SMRV), expanding the spectrum of viruses inhibited by IFITM proteins. Further analysis shows that PoIFITM1 suppresses viral entry into host cells, confirming that the IFITM-mediated restriction is conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that PoIFITM1 exerts antiviral activity by targeting to Golgi complex and the N-terminal region is required for its subcellular localization, which is not observed in other known IFITM family members. Our current data provide the first evidence that IFITM1 functions as a key effector of the innate immune to restrict virus replication in lower vertebrates, through the action of impeding viral entry."

IFITM proteins are the only known innate immune effector that inhibits viral entry. They suppressed infection of retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins of IFITM-restricted viruses [6e8], which firstly localized the IFITM-mediated restriction to the entry step in the virus replication cycle. Imaging studies provided direct evidence that IFITM proteins prevent viruses from fusing with late endosomal or lysosomal membranes [7, 12] , most likely through reducing membrane fluidity and fusion potential [13] ."

Likemammals, fish possess IFN-mediated innate immune defense against viral infection [17e19] . Some studies suggested that the IFITM-mediated restriction might be a conserved characteristic in vertebrates [20] . Indeed, four members of IFITM family (IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5) have been annotated in fish genome, which display an orthologous relationship with mammalian counterparts [20] . The expression of IFITMs was induced by PolyI:C in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) [21, 22] , suggesting their roles in IFN-mediated antiviral immune. However, so far there are no direct evidences whether fish IFITMs possess the ability to restrict virus infection, and how they exert the antiviral activity."

Multiple sequence alignment reveals that it contains two putative transmembrane domains located at amino acid residues 77e97 and 127e147 (Fig. 1A) . The transmembrane domains and intervening intracellular loop are highly conserved, whereas the N-and C-terminal regions are variable. Compared to mammalian IFITM members, PoIFITM1 has a longer N-terminal region. Two highly conserved cysteine residues of S-palmitoylation [30, 31] were also found in the first transmembrane domain (Cys 90, Cys 91) (Fig. 1B) . Phylogenetic analysis shows that PoIFITM1 forms a cluster with IFITM1 of sea bass and large yellow croaker, apart from mammalian and amphibian IFITMs (Fig. 1C) . Consistently, it exhibits 40e51% identity to other known fish IFITM1 and 35e42% identity to mammalian counterparts ( Table 2 ), indicating that PoIFITM1 is closely related to fish IFITMs whose sequences correspond to orthologs of mammalian IFITMs."

Under the same condition, we also detected the expression status of Mx, a known hallmark of the IFN response both in mammals and fish [32] .

For virus binding assay, the cells were incubated with RGV at 4 C to permit virus-host binding, but not internalization. As shown in Fig. 6 , PoIFITM1 overexpression or knockdown cells showed comparable levels of virus binding with the control cells (p > 0.05), indicating that virus-host binding interaction is not affected by the expression of PoIFITM1. For virus entry assay, the cells were infected with RGV at 4 C as above, and then incubated at 25 C. The results of real-time PCR revealed that the amount of endocytosed RGV particles decreased 1.5-fold in PoIFITM1overexpressing cell (Fig. 6A ; p < 0.005), whereas it increased 3fold in PoIFITM1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6B; p < 0.005) . These data indicate that PoIFITM1 impedes viral entry into host cells."

Consistently, measurement of the virus production revealed that overexpression of IFITM1 DN resulted in a moderate decrease in viral titer as relative to control cells (from 10 7.2 TCID 50 /ml to 10 6.9 TCID 50 /ml; p > 0.05) (Fig. 7B) .

            "text": "Emerging lines of evidence have demonstrated that IFITMs disrupt the entry step of virus infection [12, 13] . The following observations suggest that action mechanism of PoIFITM1 is similar to that of mammals. First, the virus binding and entry experiment revealed that viral particles entering into the cells to proceed replication were greatly reduced, in the presence of PoIFITM1. Second, PoIFITM1 colocalized with endocytosis marker proteins. The association between IFITM2, 3 and endocytosed transferrin has been observed in mammals, whereas IFITM1 barely exhibited colocalization with transferrin [8] . This is most likely because transferrin is a clathrin-mediated endocytic marker. Indeed, when we incubated cells with CTxB, a caveola-mediated endocytosis marker [34] , an extensive colocalization was seen. Moreover, PoI-FITM1 colocalized with CAV1, which is an essential component of caveolae and functions in the endocytosis [35] . IFITM1 has been suggested to interact and form a complex with CAV1 to function in some processes including endocytosis [36] . These findings indicate that PoIFITM1 associates with endocytic compartments. Finally, PoIFITM1 displayed a unique characteristic not observed in other known IFITM family members: subcellular distribution within the Golgi apparatus. The localization of IFITM proteins correlates with their antiviral function. Mammalian IFITMs have been described to reside in late endosomes or lysosome, where they prevent viruses fuse with host cell membranes, and thereby restrict virus replication [12] . Our recent studies have discovered that RGV entered FEC cells via a pH-dependent caveola-mediated endocytosis (J. Wang, R. Zhu and Q. Y. Zhang, unpublished data). In this entry route, the endocytosed virus requires access to acidic organelle to undergo viral-host membrane fusion. The Golgi complex is a potential fusion site for these viruses [37] . It raises the possibility that PoIFITM1 may target to the Golgi, and it is thus able to block viral membrane fusion process. Further investigation should be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which PoIFITM1 restricts virus infection with the Golgi targeting capability."

PoIFITM1 has a relatively longer N-terminal region. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that this region was crucial for the antiviral function of IFITM1, as in the case of other viruses studied [10, 16] . Due to the removing of the N-terminal region, the colocalization of PoIFITM1 with endocytosis markers as well as with Golgi was abolished; therefore PoIFITM1 lost the chance to encounter the endocytosed viral particles. This finding is consistent with a recent study that N-terminal region of IFITM3 modulates its antiviral activity by controlling the cellular localization [16] . Collectively, the data presented in the current study demonstrate that a functional IFITM1 ortholog exits in fish. RGV is a pathogen that causes lethal disease in aquaculture animals [24, 38] . Strategies that effectively induce IFITM1 activity could serve as potent therapeutic approaches for treatment against RGV infection. Therefore, our results also pave the way for future development of antiviral agents for controlling infection by pathogenic viruses in fish."
