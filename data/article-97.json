This line of work ended abruptly in the 1920s but, over the last decades, has come back into the discipline somewhat piecemeal with the reintroduction of more sophisticated stage models of societal evolution, functional analysis, human ecological analysis, and other new lines of evolutionary inquiry outlined in this paper. Our goal is to demonstrate that revitalized paradigms of the past can still be useful with modest reconceptualization, while at the same time new intellectual movements in the other social sciences, especially economics and psychology, incorporating evolutionary ideas from biology provide sociology with an opportunity to develop its own approach to evolutionary analysis that avoids the problems that let to the demise of this line of inquiry in the 1920s, as well as the problems of other social sciences applying their more narrowly focus models to sociological problems. Indeed, sociology can become a leader in the social sciences in developing more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to incorporating biology and evolutionary analysis into the social sciences. When presented in a new, more sophisticated guise, old approaches like functionalism, stage models of societal evolution, and ecological models can be seen as still having a great deal of explanatory power, while revealing a progressive and future orientation that should appeal to all contemporary sociologists. It is time, then, for sociology to remember its past in order to move into the future.",

Evolutionary analysis dominated sociology's first one-hundred years and then suddenly fell out of favor by the second decade of the twentieth Century, only to be slowly resurrected in the 1960s. But even with his dramatic revival, sociologists have been reluctant to embrace more recent approaches bringing biology and evolutionary analysis back into the core of the discipline. At the same time, economics, psychology, and political science have all had very active programs in both biological and evolutionary analysis as applied to the social world. In this second paper in the series, we try to offer reasons for why sociologists of all persuasions should reconsider what we might term the new evolutionary sociology. We hope to communicate both the range of available approaches now available, as well as what makes this new evolutionary sociology exciting and very useful in analysis across the many specialized fields that now constitute the discipline. Indeed, at a time when new subfields have emerged in sociology-sociology of the body, sociology of emotions, environmental sociology, sociology of sexuality and gender, new sociology's of race and ethnicity, and many other new lines of inquirybiological and evolutionary analysis can add something to these new areas of inquiry, while also reinvigorating older modes of sociological analysis.",

            "text": "Other social sciences and even biological sciences are not only actively pursuing evolutionary approaches to their traditional subject matter, but they are also encroaching on sociology's traditional subject matter. While some of these analyses can be quite interesting, they rarely contain much sociology, ignoring two hundred years of accumulated theorizing and research findings. Thus, if only for defending sociology as a unique mode of intellectual inquiry, it is important to see how other discipline try to redefine what is sociological. In fact, it is important for sociology to have its own distinctive approach to questions about the biology of human behavior and organization as well as the evolutionary dynamics affecting all sociocultural formations. Sociology is the only social science that considers the full range of sociocultural processes in the social universe-from the behaviors and interactions of individuals to the dynamics of world systems, and just about everything in-between. And, because of this breadth, a new evolutionary sociology can expand sociological explanations of human behavior, interaction, and social organization; at the same time, this new evolutionary sociology can also defend the discipline from encroachments by other disciplines that simply are not sufficiently broad to offer very full explanations on how the social universe operates. They can offer specialized explanations of economic, psychological, and political behaviors, but they cannot possibly, with their limited assumptions and scope, do what sociologists can do: analyze and explain all dimensions of the sociocultural universe created by humans. Thus, let this Part II in the series represent a kind of manifesto for a unique and distinctively sociological evolutionary sociology that, as we hope to demonstrate, has relevance for all types of sociology, even for sociologies less committed to the epistemology of science. At least, we hope that the reader can give us a fair hearing on the issues.",

            "text": "Human life and patterns of social organization all involve adaptations-some of them beneficial to human well-being, others just the opposite-but in viewing social life as an adaptive process, new kinds of insights can complement other approaches to analyzing social life. As a species, humans are like all other life forms and must adapt to their environments, but in doing so, humans have created an entirely new universe: the sociocultural domain of reality. In an age of climate change, environmental degradation, terrorism, warfare, oppression, and many other problems confronting humans, understanding the dynamics of the sociocultural realm of the universe is as important as understanding the biotic and physical universes, and probably more so given the problems studied by sociologists. Nothing that we propose below obviates current approaches to understanding the social universe; rather, the various approaches to evolutionary sociology can only add to the accumulated knowledge about how the sociocultural universe operates. In biology, there is now clear recognition that species often engage in \"niche construction\" whereby they create and build out some dimensions of the very environment to which they must adapt. Humans, of course, have taken this even further, creating a sociocultural universe to which we must adapt but also creating a sociocultural universe that can disrupt the other universes-biotic and physical. So much of the discipline of sociology is devoted to understanding problems and pathologies of many of sociocultural formations for human well-being, and now, sociology is extending its analysis to the effects of human sociocultural formations in generating problems and crises, per se, in the biotic and physical universes that, in turn, have large consequences for the viability of the sociocultural universe itself and for meeting basic human needs as a life form. The new evolutionary sociology is thus central to much that concerns not only sociologists but also the general population as well.",

Humans are an animal that evolved like any other animal, and the fact that humans have big brains, language, and culture does not obviate biology or evolution. First, all human biological traits, including high levels of interpersonal capacities and emotionality, big brains allowing for expanded cognitive capacities, spoken language, and symbolic culture are the product of biological evolution. Second, and equally fundamental, culture and social structures have not obviated the influence of humans' evolved biology on behavior and social organization. In fact, it is only because of our evolution as a biological species that we have the capacity and motivation to produce the higher levels of social organization that are the focus of most sociological research. Moreover, the creation of humans' evolved biology as it allows for the creation of the sociocultural universe can have reverse or feedback casual effects on humans' biology, even at the level of the human genome. Thus, evolution works both ways: humans evolved biology led to the credation of the sociocultural universe, and once this universe exists, it feeds back and has effects on human biology and psychology. Indeed, as it is evident today, the sociocultural universe has effects on all other life forms, even bacteria and viruses, and the ecosystems in which all other life forms live. A sociology informed by biology and evolutionary analysis is, therefore, highly relevant to understanding virtually all of the problems facing humanity and the rest of the planet today.",

Another force that is implicit but should be emphasized is the variations of genotypes along a bell curve, or some other distribution, which makes available in existing genotypes a range of variation with tails of the distribution often being selected upon independently of the other three forces of variation (i.e., mutations, gene flow, and genetic drift). A very important emphasis in the Modern Synthesis is that natural selection works on the variations in individual phenotypes (and hence, underlying genotypes producing phenotypes), but it is the population of individuals, or the gene pool of a population, that evolves. Selection, in other words, is through differential rates of reproduction and mortality of individual members of a species. Another assumption in the Modern Synthesis is that natural selection is \"blind\"i.e., without purpose or goals.",

In addition, the field of epigenetics has established that the expression of genes-in other words, their influence on the organism and its behaviors-is responsive to the organism's environment, and thus assumption of unidirectional influence of the gene that underlies the Modern Synthesis is no longer accepted by many evolutionary biologists. We first highlight the ways that the Modern Synthesis needs to be supplemented in order to explain the operation of human superorganisms. We then review the research in genetics that has challenged basic assumptions of the Modern Synthesis and created a foundation for a different approach to connecting evolutionary biology and sociology.",

The argument goes something like this: blind natural selection selected upon those individuals and their genotypes evidencing variants of genetically controlled patterns of cooperation and altruism for the benefit of the larger social whole (the superorganisms) rather than the individual organism. Those variants in the behavioral phenotypes of a species that pushed for cooperation and systemic survival of the superorganisms over the individual organism would, under certain conditions, be more fitness enhancing than selection for traits that push individual organisms to be \"selfish\" in trying to sustain the individual rather than the \"group.\" Thus, individual selection works to promote viable grouping strategies as a kind of superorganism, with the superorganisms providing increased fitness for the population of individuals. This is selection for group organization, but not necessarily selection on the group because emphasis is still on individual-level selection, and it is still the genotype of the population (conceptualized as a \"gene pool\"), not of the superorganism, that evolves.",

Selection on genes, of course can still occur, but in a species that has developed symbolic language and culture, the very nature and targets of selection dynamics are altered (Damasio 1994; Kahneman 2011:28) . From the spread of lactose tolerance after the development of dairy farming to the effect that the control of fire and the use of tools had on human bodies and brains, cultural variation has had larger effects on the evolution of human behaviors now organized by layers of social structure and culture as compared to biological constraints (Henrich 2015) . The development of more intense social bonds itself reflected this co-evolutionary process (Laland and Brown 2011:179-183; Richerson et al. 2016) . Culturally-based adaptation to different environments could then favor selection on groups as well as individuals within these groups, leading hominins and then humans to become more social and more prone to form stable groupings (Turner 2021; Turner and Maryanski 2008; Boyd and Richerson 2009:3281, 3284; Haidt 2012) .",

However, even the vague suggestion that selection might be working on the group rather than the individual and its genome was very threatening to many committed to Modern Synthesis in biology. Indeed, the idea was so threatening that a new branch of biology, sociobiology, was created for the very purpose of rejecting group selection arguments. Wynne-Edward's argument was not what the early sociobiologists seemed to fear; and yet, their reaction tells us that the Modern Synthesis in biology is, for many, a sacred creed. As we will expand upon later, Wynn Edwards was not arguing that groups are the unit of selection, nor was he arguing that the group is unit of evolution, but any hint of such being the case was blasphemous and subject to critique, even though Wynne-Edwards was only arguing that selection was working on individuals phenotypes and underlying genotypes to create more cooperative behaviors as a strategy for survival. Yet, the battle was joined, and the notion of group selection become controversial, and remains so right up to the present. For out purposes, the battle over group selection defines the fundamental differences between evolutionary biology and evolutionary sociology, as we will see. Efforts to smoothe over the points in this battle have been many, but the most prominent has been the introduction of the notion of multilevel selection which, as we note below, has its own elliptical and vague tenets.",

In its most extreme form, which we will argue for, selection now occurs not just on biological phenotypes and underlying genotypes but also on the social structures that organize humans'. Moreover, once selection is on sociocultural formations, it is now more than just the gene pool of the population that is evolving but, rather, various levels of sociocultural formations are the units that are evolving, from a sociological perspective. The universe is now conceptualized as operating at various levels, from individuals and their phenotypes (and underlying genotype) to layers of social structures and their cultures guiding individual behaviors, with the consequence that selection is now definitely on social structures and their cultures, as well as on different levels of organizational structure, and equally fundamental, the unit of evolution is now much more than the population of individuals and involves transformations of organizational structures by non-Darwinian selection (that is, selection is not working blindly on underlying genotypes when selection is on human sociocultural structures, nor does such evolution only involve the gene pool). Once these next steps are taken in arguments about group selection and multi-level selection, the Modern Synthesis is revealed as inadequate to explain the evolution of human superorganisms. As we will highlight later in this paper, advances in genetics and neuroscience have also undermined the adequacy of the Modern Synthesis or biology proper and suggest even stronger parallels between evolution at the biological and sociocultural levels.",

            "text": "To assert that human superorganisms evolve by non-Darwinian types of selection invites intense debate with those who have tried to retain fidelity with the Modern Synthesis, even as they shift to trying to explain patterns of social behavior and social organization among humans. If humans' capacity for culture and ability to create new types of sociocultural formations to solve adaptive problems are now seen as the unit of evolution (rather than the gene pool), then selection begins to operate very differently than as conceptualized by the Modern Synthesis. The companion paper, \"Biology and American Sociology, Part I: The Rise of Evolutionary Thinking, Its Rejection, and Potential Resurrection\" ended with a much more robust conception of sociocultural system under selection in human superorganisms. Moreover, this first article ended with the suggestion that much evolution and the selection pressures driving this evolution of the sociocultural universe involves different types of non-Darwinian selection working on different levels of sociocultural formations. Furthermore, while evolution of a population's gene pool may be evolving under Darwinian selection pressures, the much more interesting evolution is on the embedded layers of sociocultural reality conceptualized as social structures regulated by cultural systems of beliefs, ideologies, values, and norms at different levels of social organization. Most biologically oriented scholars, even who appear to accept some form of multi-level selection, are generally not willing to go this far because traditional Darwinian-oriented biology loses its privileged position which, from our point of view, is appropriate because we are not addressing the biology of the individual but, instead, the sociology of sociocultural rather than biological evolution. The key is for both sociologists and other social scientists, on the one side, and biologically oriented scientists, on the other side, to recognize the obvious: the sociocultural universe and the biological universe both evolve and both evolve under selection on variants in structures or phenotypes. Biological and sociocultural evolution are alike in this general sense, but they are fundamentally different because, in sociocultural evolution, (a) units of evolution are superorganisms, (b) selection is on different layers of sociocultural formations, (c) selection is not blind, and (d) type of selection can vary. Figure 1 outlines this somewhat different view of multi-level selection somewhat along the lines of Part I of these two papers.",

Moreover, much subsequent evolution of humans has not been so much biological-although this too has occurred-but sociocultural as new layers of social structure and their cultures were built up from group-level corporate units to communities and organizations into distinctive and differentiated institutional systems (kinship, religion, polity, law, economy, etc.) that, in turn, were the building blocks of societies and inter-societal systems and their cultures. contrast, in the sociocultural universe selection is on teleological systems that can create rapidly new variations in response to selection pressures from the environment. Moreover, selection can come from many sources in sociocultural systems, from any of the units of socicultural organization, as is denoted by the double arrows, and from even changes in human phenotypes and genotypes. Conversely, human phenotypes and their underlying genotype are protected not only by their epidermis and other forces like an immune system, they are also protected by their embedding in multiples layers of social structures and their cultures--from groups to organizations, to communities, to institutions, and to societies, as well as inter-societal systems.",

For example, in the pandemic like the one occurring right now in early spring of 2020, selection on the medical institutional system and all of the corporate units (groups, organizations, and communities) from which the institution of medicine is constructed (and their cultures), as well as on those other institutional systems that provide resources for the institution of medicine (e.g., polity, economy, science, law, and education). Indeed, what an evolutionary analysis reveals is the inadequacy of many of the organizational systems for dealing with pandemics; and perhaps, something good will come of the current pandemic in re-organizing the institutional system of medicine. Indeed, an evolutionary approach highlights what needs to be done to generate a more effective sociocultural epidermis for protecting human life. And, while there is a mad dash to find drugs that can limit the harm of the coronavirus or to find a viable vaccine, this too is sociocultural in nature, revolving around research in new drugs by both governmental agencies, private companies in the economy, and health organizations in the institution of medicine. A pandemic is a threat not only to the human organism, but to the superorganisms that organizes human social life; and so, it is a good case where selection is working at almost every level-from the individual and its genotype to whole societies as well as inter-societal systems and the institution systems organizing societies.",

Depending on our purposes, we may emphasize Darwinian selection on individual phenotypes in an evolving gene pool of the population or non-Darwinian selection on sociocultural formations that are evolving.

For example, if analysis seeks to explain the evolution of culture, then a heavy dose of biological theory is relevant in trying to understand why and how the brain grew and made possible sociality as well as spoken language and culture (see Turner 2021 for an example), whereas if we are trying to explain why languages change or why values and ideologies change in a population, then we need to emphasize non-Darwinian selection forces operating at various levels of social reality outlined in Fig. 1 .

Critics have asserted that theorists lined up a list of functional requisites and then mechanically explained the emergence and evolution of a structural or cultural phenomenon as meeting one of these needs. The problems with such crude arguments is that they are tautological-needs explain structures, and the existence of structures explain needsor they are an illegitimate teleology in which outcomes explain the existence of the very social forces that led to these outcomes.

Functionalism's brief re-emergence in the 1950-1970s (e.g., Parsons 1951 , Parson et al. 1952 Merton 1968 ) was, therefore, somewhat surprising but its reason for reemergence is that it examines the social universe in systemic terms, as did the old biological analogies of Comte and Spencer. And, it should not be surprising that riding on the coattails of functionalism's revival came stage model theorizing in the 1960s, but now with a more conflict theoretical orientation (e.g., Lenski 1964) , although more Integration (coordination and social control)",

This time around, however, stage modeling persisted and did not die off, and indeed has adopted in a number of guises by world systems analysis (see below). There is, however, a way to make functionalism central to evolutionary analysis of societies. Rather than view what have been labelled \"functional requisites\" or \"functional needs,\" it is better to conceptualize them as axes or domains in which selection pressures tend to build up in human social systems. In many ways, this was Herbert Spencer's (1874-96) intention with his notions of differentiation in human societies occurring along a set of axes: production, reproduction, regulation, and distribution. The same would be true of other lists of functional requisites, such as Talcott Parsons' notions of adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latency. Spencer always argued that societies can dissolve and de-evolve if a population cannot generate enough productivity, cannot distribute this productivity as well as information and movement of members of the population, cannot develop and expand reproductive mechanisms as societies are growing, and cannot regulate, coordinate, and control populations through the consolidation of power and development of cultural systems. Table 1 lists the socalled functional requisites of a number of early and later scholars considered to be \"functional theorists.\" Two things become immediately evident: the lists converge to a high degree with a relatively small number of such requisites; and what is also clear, this lists of requisite denotes potential problem areas of adaptation to changing environments, whether it be internal environments generated by population growth, over-consumption of resources, and new organizational problems, external environments from degradation of the ecosystem, or potential conflict with other societies.",

Can a society produce enough, efficiently distribute production, stabilize reproduction of persons and the structures organizing their activities, consolidate and centralize power to regulate, coordinate and control a population and its organizational units, codify ideologies, laws, and norms that are accepted by members of a population and organize their activities, and maintain power and cultural systems that generate additional integration of structures and incumbents in these structures at all levels of social organization, especially as a population grows and differentiates and/or faces internal crises or threats from the external environment?",

Thus, superorganisms are like organisms: they are subject to selection pressures, and some of these are similar for both organisms and superorganisms, which is all that early organismic analogies by Comte and Spencer were trying to suggest. Thus, sociology risks throwing out the \"baby\" (a way to conceptualize generic selection forces on human societies) with the dirty \"bathwater\" (the problematic nature of functionalist analysis). But, the early functionalists were, in reality, trying to get a handle on evolution before and then after Darwin's definitive work; and they had gone a long way in doing so. And, what they discovered and the methods that they employed can still be part of evolutionary analysis in the twenty-first Century. Indeed, rather than trying to adapt hard-core Darwinian analysis to sociology, we should re-utilize in a different guise some early ideas that will let sociologists get a better handle on sociocultural selection dynamics, as distinct from blind natural selection on organismic phenotypes.",

In almost all cases when this kind of question is asked, analysis reveals many of the maladaptive problems inhering in institutional systems and the corporate units from which these systems of constructed. In asking this simple question, what was once considered a conservative and perhaps even retrogressive form of analysis becomes quite progressive in highlighting the direction that institutional evolution should take in overcoming its current inadequacies. Indeed, many social movements trying to change societies are, in essence, implicitly evolutionary because they emphasize the need to restructure societies in ways that are more adaptive at many levels, from individual health and psychological well-being to institutional viability in the face of adaptive problems. Moreover, the new evolutionary sociology will also allow sociologists to separate more than has been previously possible the biological nature of humans as evolve animals from their sociocultural creations; and in so doing, we have an additional capacity to assess whether or not existing patterns of social organization are meeting humans fundamental nature. We no longer need to posit lists of speculation about human nature that has been done for thousands of years, but the new evolutionary sociology can now isolate what is biological from what it not, and thereby, it becomes possible to use a revitalized emphasis on points of selection pressures and analysis of the sociocultural responses to these pressures in order to assess whether or not, and to what degree or not, these sociocultural responses are adaptive to not only the environment generating these sociocultural responses but also to the well-being of humans as biological animals. Adaptation is more than a sociocultural formation surviving in an environment; it is, as most progressive sociologists would argue, also necessary to assess the degree to which these formations are conducive to humans' evolve nature as an animal. Indeed, this is the goal of much activist sociology; and we argue that evolutionary sociology has the capacity to provide a new way to assess whether sociocultural formations are just and healthy for humans (Turner 2021) .",

Later, Lenski's (2005) more ecological model outlined the specific dynamics leading to the evolution of each of type of society that had evolved in human history: hunting and gathering, pastoral and horticultural, fishing, agrarian, industrial and post-industrial, while the many editions of his book on Human Societies with Patrick Nolan (Nolan and Lenski 2018) continued to describe the dynamics of these societies based on data collected from the HRAF.",

To understand the present day, it is useful to understand how, why, and when the structures and cultures of human societies evolved, and periodically de-evolved. Equally significant, human societal evolution reveals very clear patterns; for, while each society is somewhat unique in its history, the various stages outlined in stage modeling emphasize what societies have in common historically (Abrutyn and Lawrence 2010; Abrutyn 2013a Abrutyn , 2013b Abrutyn , 2015 . By emphasizing those features that are common, rather than unique to each society, theorizing becomes possible; and if we examine societal stages theoretically, it is clear that the selection pressures emphasized by functionalism are key parts of the theories about the formation of each basic type of society that has evolved over the last 350,000 years, especially over the last 12,000 years as societies grew in scale and complexity. Indeed, stage models of societal evolution emphasize processes of differentiation of (a) institutional systems (and the corporate unit from which they are constructed) and (b) stratification systems generated by the unequal distributions of valued resources by each institutional domain, particularly economy and polity but all other domains as well. By understanding when in history various institutional domains, emerging as responses to adaptive problems, first evolve and then elaborate their structures, we also can understand how the nature and basis of stratification has changed during the course of institutional evolution. This knowledge, in turn, can be used to assess the kind of structural and cultural formations that can reduce inequalities that, over all of recent history, have inevitably lead to new adaptive problems for human societies.",

Increasingly, sociologists came to view-as had Spencer and Weber decades earlier (Turner and McCafree 2021)-that any given society is connected to other societies; and moreover, it is not the societies, per se, that are evolving but the system of societies engaged in geo-economic and geo-political activities. Thus, focus shifted to theories of interrelations among societies, or the system of societies, as the most important unit because the dynamics of any one society and its evolution are very much tied to relations with, and its place within a larger system of societies. And so, evolutionary analysis in sociology has increasingly focused on what are termed \"world systems,\" \"systems of societies\" or more simply, \"inter-societal relations.\" Of course, there has always been a great deal of work by historians on \"world civilizations\" but the work of sociologists was more theoretical and involved a search for universal patterns of world system dynamics. A critical distinction was drawn between world empires and world economic systems (Wallerstein 1974) ; and while the two are related, sociological analysis has tended to separate them, with world systems analysis emphasizing the dynamics of geo-economic change, while more historical sociology has tended to focus on Spencer's view that warfare has been a driving force in societal evolution, thus making geo-politics a somewhat separate model of analysis.",

            "text": "Inter-Societal Models in Geo-Economic Approaches have focused on the emergence of capitalism as a world-level force generating a particular pattern of relations among societies. Early formulations by Immanuel Wallerstein distinguished among the core, periphery, and semi-periphery as the basic structure of a world economic system, with the core being the dominant and most economically developed engaged in exploitative trade relations with the periphery for raw materials under very unequal terms of exchange because of the dependency of undeveloped but resource rich societies on developed societies for capital needed to exploit these resources. The semi-periphery stands between the two extremes in the system and often works as the broker for the core in its exploitation of the periphery; and indeed, often the evolution of the world economic system leads a society or societies at the semi-periphery displacing societies at the core. Thus, Spain and Portugal are no longer core nations dominating the economic world system; and other European powers such as England and France are less significant than Germany, whereas the United States and China, former peripheral and semi-peripheral societies, now control the world economic system. There is now a vast literature and many models of the dynamics of such geo-economic systems that have brought a new sophistication to evolutionary analysis (e.g., Frank 1969 Frank , 1978 Frank , 1979 Frank , 1998 Braudel 1972 Braudel , 1975 Braudel , 1977 Braudel , 1979 Arrighi 1994) ). And, because many of these geo-economic theories of world system evolution borrow from Marx, they often have an \"end of history\" argument that the world capitalist system, as it evolves and exposes basic internal contradictions, will usher in world-level socialism. Such arguments, much like the critics of early evolutionary analysis in sociology, reveal a kind of ethnocentrism and bias that probably hinders, to some degree, their analyses because it is equally likely that the present world capitalist system could de-evole system could as capitalist production and markets collapse, as a pandemic forces isolation of societies, or as environmental degradation increases geo-political competition that destroys the capitalist economic system. Thus, the evolution of the world system of societies is likely to be a crucial focus of evolutionary sociology in the future.",

First, Chase-Dunn and colleagues have emphasized that such systems are not new but, in fact, have existed among pre-literate populations. Second, geoeconomic dynamics always continue to interact with geo-political dynamics. Third, world system dynamics can be conceptualized in ecological terms revolving around the consolidation of power, development of technologies, and population growth as increasing intensification of resource extraction and production, leading to environmental degradation that in turn leads to circumscription, emigration of populations in search of resources, and eventually warfare in a constant cycle or what he terms as an iteration model of evolution. Fourth, the core, periphery, and semi-periphery distinction made by Wallerstein is not always evident, arguing for a view that there are various types of networks connecting societies, such as place networks (around geographical densities around polities), bulk goods networks (involving exchange of food and raw materials), political-military networks that extend other networks, information networks, prestige networks in which symbols of honor circulate. Thus, geo-economic and geo-political empires rise and fall as stratification and inequality, political centralization and corruption, sunk costs into infrastructures that are difficult to change, and conservative ideologies all increase, leading to the demise and reorganization of the networks constituting a geopolitical and geo-economic system. Still, in Chase-Dunn's models, these oscillating dynamics are slowly building toward an end of history stage of world system development, world-level socialism.",

Peter Turchin (2003 Turchin ( , 2006 Turchin ( , 2010 Turchin ( , 2013 and colleagues (Turchin and Nefadov 2009) have developed models of pre-industrial evolution revolving around secular cycles in which societies after successful warfare expand under conditions of high solidarity, low political instability, abundant lands, increased cultivation, low prices, high real wages, low rents, high personal consumption, low levels of usury high economic reserves, rural settlement growth, low levels of urbanization, low taxes, optimistic ideologies, and low levels of state intervention in the economy. Eventually this \"integrative phase\" is followed by a \"disintegrative phase\" in which all of the conditions marking the integrative phase are reversed, leading to instability of polity, economic stagnation, elite corruption, increased stratification and other reversals and thus a \"crisis phase\" that morphs into a \"depression phase,\" often leading to revolts and internal political instability and/or to intervention by another political power.

What is evident, then, is that some of the key ideas of both Weber and Spencer on historical changes in societies, often conceptualized as cycles and phases of evolution of societies, have become part of a new evolutionary sociology.

Whether the Chicago School adopted Durkheim's ideas or, instead, borrowed from a more general view of the \"web of life\" (Irwin 2015) , which was prominent in early ecological analysis in the United States, ecological theorizing was the only branch of evolutionary theorizing in American sociology to survive during the entire twentieth Century into the first two decades of the twenty-first Century.",

            "text": "Urban Ecology Early work by Chicago School sociologists led to a vision of Chicago and, by inference, other urban areas as an organic whole (a la the \"web of life\" metaphor) but more Darwinian ideas were also introduced, particularly the notion that actors (individuals and corporate units) engage in different activities and, thereby, compete for the resources available in urban space. Such competition is institutionalized by real estate markets that sorts actors by their ability to pay for particular \"niches\" in urban space, thereby leading the differentiation of urban space as a kind of \"ecological system\" (Park and Burgess 1921; Wirth 1938; Hoyt 1939; Harris and Ullman 1945) . Later, this imagery was used to understand other communities beyond Chicago and, equally important, the con-urban metropolitan regions that began to form in the second half of the twentieth Century (e.g., Hawley 1944 Hawley , 1986 . (1977)-of Amos Hawley, who had moved from Chicago to North Carolina, extended the ecological model to organizations in a much more self-conscious effort than urban ecology to adopt ideas from biology to sociology. Organizations were seen as resource-seeking entities with populations of organization seeking similar resources constituting a distinctive resource niche. The resource could be customers, students, club members, or virtually any resource that an organization needed to sustain its operation. As the number of organizations seeking resources in the same niche increased, the density of the population increased, leading to more intense competition for resources. Those that could not successfully compete were selected out of the niche, either failing or moving to a new resource niche, with the result that the population of organizations would generally increase as long as resources were plentiful but, over time as density and competition increased, the number would decrease to the carrying capacity of the niche, with less extreme fluctuations. From the seminal ideas of Hannan and Freeman, a variety of types of organizational ecology were developed (e.g., McPherson 1983 McPherson , 1988 McPherson and Ranger-Moore 1991) .",

Such theorizing is a relatively modest but decisive extension of ideas from Spencer and Durkheim which, unlike stage models of societal evolution, developed for the whole of the twentieth Century to their present state of sophistication.

Since anthropologists had not abandoned stage modeling in the mid-twentieth century as sociologists had, the first signs of a more macro level ecology came from anthropological theorists like Leslie White (1959 White ( [2007 ). This new form of theorizing emphasized \"energy capture\" as the driving force of societal evolution in which the relationship between technology and energy in generating increased productivity was emphasized. Similarly, Gerhard Lenski (2005) also began to recast his evolutionary arguments in a more ecology framework, emphasizing the effects of technology, coupled with capital formation (tools of production), would increase production and, thereby, force the elaboration of larger and more complex societies, generating higher levels of economic surplus beyond the consumption needs of a population for survival. He emphasize an economic surplus is a function of (resources) x (technology) x (capital), divided by the size of the population, increases economic surplus which in turn leads to the further development of a society. White had also emphasized that population size is critical in generating selection pressures for increased production and economic surplus but also can serve as a drag on societal evolution if its size exceeds the productive capacities of the economy and technology available.",

And as Spencer had emphasized, Boserup also stressed that evolution can continue as long as production can keep pace with population growth. If the expansion of societies fails to keep pace, however, then de-evolution is likely. As Lenski (2005) emphasized, societies can be conceptualized as a set of relations among population, technology, ideologies (cultural values and beliefs), and patterns of institutional organization; and as these all increase and expand, the size of the population is likely to increase. In turn, these changes will all have increasing effects of the biophysical environment, as well as the sociocultural environments composed of other societies. However, if population growth and environmental pressures have negative effects on production and patterns of social organization, then the biophysical environment will exert greater effects of further societal evolution and, potentially, cause societal de-evolution of societies in the face of environmental crises.",

Populations are thus responding to the very selection pressures emphasized by Spencer and Durkheim, revolving around several basic fault lines in all human societies: production of resources necessary to sustain a population and the social structures organizing this population, reproducing the larger population and the structures organizing social life, developing distributive infrastructures (for dispersal of resources, information, and people), creating new structures for regulation and social control, such as law and polity, and new forms of cultural beliefs and ideologies that can integrate differentiated members of a population. And, as the scale of societal organization increases, the increasing effects of scale on the biosphere and on other societies all operate to create not only inter-societal systems but also potential conflict among societies or even among different inter-societal systems. These are the kinds of ecological and evolutionary processes that only the social sciences can study profitably because they involve dynamics that cannot be adequately conceptualized with a \"generalized Darwinism\" that expands rather modestly the Modern Synthesis in biology. Such is particularly the case with efforts in biology and psychology to attempt to do so within only the basic elements of the Modern Synthesis; and while they can offer new insights, they cannot supplant a more distinctly social science approach to evolutionary and ecological dynamics, as will become evident in the next section.",

As emphasized earlier in discussing multi-level or group selection, this new approach to evolution placed great emphasis on the genotype, emphasizing that phenotypes of organisms are merely the survivor machine for the real driving force driving evolution, the gene which seeks \"immortality\" and the ability to remain in the gene pool. Somewhat later, psychologists began to accept much of the emphasis of sociobiology but added a focus on the brain, with behaviors seen as outcomes of natural selection reworking on the brain to generate fitness enhancing behaviors that preserved genes in the gene pool. Thus, what came to be known as evolutionary psychology (Barkow et al. 1992; Buss, 2016a, b) joined sociobiology to study phenomena that were increasingly sociological in nature.",

But to biologists it was threatening, and as a result, those who founded sociobiology shifted their focus to the gene and genome of organisms, emphasizing that natural selection is working on phenotypes to select the most fit genes for individuals. The phenotype of an individual is thus a \"survivor machine\" of the genome (Dawkins 1976 ) that was implicitly directing evolution so as to facilitate survival of genes.",

Selection is not blind, as it is in organic evolution; rather, in human superorganisms (the organization of persons), humans actions and patterns of social organization are self-directed with individuals and all of the corporate units in which they are organized having capacities to make decisions that facilitate adjustment to changing environmental conditions generating selection pressures on human groupings. Selection thus does not work on the individual and its genome, but instead, works on the viability of patterns of social organization and on corporate units from which patterns of social organization are constructed-organizing individuals to make decisions to change sociocultural phenotypes regulated by culture in response to selection pressures. Thus, selection is less on the individual than on the corporate units and their cultures that make up sociocultural formations, and moreover, it is not the phenotype of the populations of individuals and their underlying gene pool that is evolving. Selection is on the sociocultural phenotypes, and it is the structure and culture of this phenotype that evolves.",

Selection is not Darwinian and blind in simply allowing those phenotypical (and genetic) traits that facilitate fitness to persist, while selecting out those that do not facilitate fitness. In human systems, humans are aware of the selection pressures on their patterns of social organization, and they are capable of using their capacities for agency to reduce these pressures by changing their sociocultural phenotypes. True, a type of non-Darwinian selection is still an important driving force of sociocultural evolution, but it does not work blindly; and evolution generally is not on organisms' phenotypes and underlying genotypes, but rather, on sociocultural phenotypes and the structural patterns and cultural codes organizing these sociocultural phenotypes.",

Emphasis was on how natural selection altered the brain to produce fitness enhancing behaviors during the late Pleistocence (1.0 to 0.3 million years) of hominin evolution into early humans (e.g, Neanderthals, Homo sapiens), with these alterations in the brain producing fitness enhancing behaviors that undergird patterns of human social organization. Early forms of this argument tended to argue for discrete modules evolving in the brain to solve particular adaptive problems, which now appear to have diminished primarily because the structure of the human brain was very much in place by the late Pleistocene, with most of the evolution revolving around increases in the size of neocortical and subcortical areas, and increased connectivity. Indeed, there was a kind of functionalism implicit in these early arguments: a need for a particular type of structure would magically produce a module in the brain to meet that need.",

Hence, many sociological analyses using the framework of evolutionary psychology focus on rates of certain types of behaviors, such as exchange, kin biases, crime, deviance, promiscuity, sexuality, and many more behavior strategies that increase fitness of the individual and hence preserve individuals' genes in the gene pool. Some interesting findings do emerge from these efforts but they are typically couched as \"just so stories\": Individuals are driven to maintain their genes and pass them on (and hence remain in the gene pool); behavior X increases the chances of individuals surviving and passing on their genes; and then a story is constructed about how, in the distant evolutionary past, those individuals whose brains pushed them to emit behavior X were more likely to survive, while those whose brains did not produce behavior X, were selected out of the gene pool. Sometimes these \"just so\" stories can have a certain credibility; at other times, they seem rather ad hoc.",

Below, we briefly outline several research programs. To engage in this kind of analysis, scholars borrow methodologies from biology with a sociological orientation, revolving around a recognition that humans, as evolved animals, surely have inherited behavioral and organizational propensities that are hard-wired and, to an extent under genetic control, while at the same time humans are an evolved animal with capacities for language and culture which, to a degree, liberate them from their inherited biology.",

This ability to compare genomes allows for a powerful cladistic analysis comparing humans and great apes (Andrews and Martin 1987) . Cladistic analysis is, in many ways, a biological version of historical reconstructions of languages (Jeffers and Lehiste 1979) in which languages that are believed to be descendants of a common \"mother language\" are analyzed to discover the nature of this mother language. The logic of historical reconstruction of languages is that if the descendant languages all share certain common features, then these are likely to have been present in the lost mother language.",

This closeness assures that humans shared ancestors with each of the great apes; and thus by the logic of cladistic analysis, the behavioral and organizational traits that they share were likely present in the last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and each great ape. Cladistics thus provides a tool for sociologists to look back in time and get a very real sense of what humans' distant ancestors were like and, in so doing, give us a reasonable sense for the biology that humans inherited from their hominin ancestors. We can see, in essence, what humans' ancestors were like, behaviorally and organizationally, before language, culture, and big brains evolved.",

The results were some startling and counterintuitive findings: apes are weak-tie animals, with few strong social ties; apes do not form kinship units beyond mother-offspring ties, which are broken forever for two of the three great apes at puberty; great apes do not form permanent groups of any sort; community is the only social structure \"organizing\" great apes who wander around communities, often alone, forming very short-term ties and groups that soon break apart.

Indeed, from a sociological perspective, the evolutionary path from apes does not automatically lead to social structure and cultures; and in fact, the lack of sociality and permanent groups among humans' distant ancestors suggests that the principal selection pressures on humans were to become more social and grouporiented. Emotions were the key to enhancing the social ties among hominins and in generating higher levels of group solidarity. Thus, long before spoken language and capacities for symbolic culture could evolve as the neocortex of the brain grew, subcortical emotion centers grew and provided the needed behavioral trait-emotionality-for hominin and, hence, human survival. Thus, it is now possible to do both biology and sociology without having to reduce sociology to biology; indeed, it was a sociological force-the imperative to get better organized, or die-that changed greatape neuroanatomy into human neuroanatomy.",

Moreover, they come neurologists more than sociobiologists and hence have a somewhat stronger basis for generalization, and yet, the temptation is always there to overgeneralize. Thus, as eluded to above, are such behaviors as prosociality and altruism part of humans' evolved biological nature? The answer is: to a degree, but not quite as formulated even by neurologists who are not clearly separating what may be learned behaviors as such learning has affected the brain. Thus, comparative analysis with humans' closest relatives is needed to supplement the neurology discussed in these speculation. And so, one way to assess such claims neurologists, as well as those for kin selection and reciprocal altruism by sociolobiologists or for any other hypothesized state of human nature hypothesized by social scientists and philosophers is to look at recent work using cladistic analysis and comparative neuroanatomy done by a sociologist to see if these and similar ideas hold merit (Turner 2021 ; see also Maryanski 1992; Turner and Maryanski 2008) . Some of the claims, such as kin selection, do not have a biological basis in humans; others like reciprocity do. And what about notions of hard wired-altruism and sociality?: partially true, with some qualifications. Thus, sociologists adopting biological methods have done much to clarify claims about what is part of human nature, and what is part of humans culture as it affects behaviors. Such knowledge can be used by other scientists and by sociologists seeking to discover what social and cultural arrangements are most compatible with humans' evolved biology. Answers to such question would, we believe, be useful to many types of researchers and advocates within sociology for more humane social arrangements, but this time, such arguments would be based on empirical facts rather than only ideology.",

The reason that this comparison was so useful is that insects are under relatively tight genetic control whereas as humans are not, and yet, both are able to generate mass societies and, as Machalek outlines, both social insects and humans had to manage certain similar \"design problems\" to do so.

For instance, large aquatic animals like whales have bodies that are simply too large to create a mass society, even though they are highly social and have what looks like language capacities. Ecological constraints also impose limits on how large or complex a society can be-constraints such as available food, shelter, diversity of other species, number of predators, mortality rates, and vulnerability to disease. Cost-benefit constraints revolve around the benefits vs. costs of forming very large societies. Among insects, for example, costs would include social parasitism where other species can expropriate food and labor from ants potentially exceeding the benefits of mass organization and a division of labor that allows ants to compensate for their small size. Sociological constraints include the need for members of a species to engage in impersonal cooperation in a division of labor with strangers, something that most species cannot do; moreover, in mass societies, members must be divided into distinct categories; and finally, the division of labor and diverse categories must somehow be coordinated and integrated.",

Fortunately, twenty million years of great ape evolution in arboreal habitats had already done so, thereby making prolonger life history characteristics a pre-adaptation for what was need among larger brained humans: prolonged care of immature offspring that would allow their brains to become fully formed after leaving the womb (see Turner and Maryanski 2008) .",

The human brain's exceptionally large prefrontal cortex (PFC) enables human self-control through \"executive functioning\" involving planning, weighing alternatives, making decisions, and inhibiting habitual responses (Lieberman 2013:112-115; TenHouten 2013:221-224) . But in spite of these capacities, the PFC does not allow humans to calculate coolly the means required to achieve desirable ends (TenHouten 2013:123-124) . Emotional reactions travel through faster circuits in the brain and so can shape actions taken in response to events without any conscious recognition of their influence (Kahneman 2011). Emotions are also required in order to select desired ends and focus attention on critical information (Damasio 1994; TenHouten 2013:122) . Both reason and emotion work to value and maintain social connection and avoid social rejection (Coan et al. 2014:94-96) .",

But recognizing sociality as an evolved, biological dimension of human nature also creates new challenges for sociological theory. Durkheim's early efforts to account for the shortcomings he recognized in the division of labor as a basis of solidarity appear futile in light of the evolved need for personal social relationships (as he seemed to recognize in his subsequent work). The evolved basis of human traits favoring egalitarianism magnifies problems for human solidarity created by soaring levels of inequality (de Waal 1996:138-145) . Weber's expectation that modern society could persist with a strictly legal-rational basis of social organization also appears unrealistic (Fessler and Haley 2003) .",

It is not necessary to engage in reductionism, nor do sociologists have to take a back seat to biologists, psychologists or economists engaged in evolutionary analysis. The label evolutionary sociology captures much of what is possible: retain the older evolutionary approaches that typified early sociology-(1) stage model evolutionism, social ecology, and a reformed functionalism focusing on selection pressures rather than functional needs and requisites; (2) new comparative approaches to geo-economics and geo-politics that incorporate ecological and selectionist models to explain inter-societal relations; and (3) new approaches in biology such as cladistics, comparative neuroanatomy, and even sociobiology and evolutionary psychology (toned down to the realities of the emergent properties of social structures and culture that are not explicable by reference to biologically driven behaviors, per se), all informed by modern genetics and social neuroscience.",

Further, knowing the points at which selection tends to operate in human societies and being able to isolate out the biology of human nature as opposed to cultural influences on human behaviors allows for a more accurate assessment as to what humans needs and what is possible in organizing societies to meet these needs-which is, after all, the goal of almost all activist sociologies.",

It would be ironic that at the very time biology, economics, and psychology are adopting evolutionary analysis for their own subject matter but also for sociology's subject matter that sociologists remained blinded to the new options that evolutionary sociology provides. As we have tried to outline above, the range of approaches for a new evolutionary sociology is now quite broad and gives evolutionary analysis in sociology a unique character suited to the broad subject matter of the discipline.",

Seidman for his many contributions; his untimely death has been a great loss for integrative scholarship as well as for the field of neuropsychology. An earlier version of this paper coauthored with Dr. Seidman was presented at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association. Some material was developed first for introductory chapters in Social Neuroscience: Brain, Mind, and Society. 2015. Schutt, Russell K., Larry J. Seidman, Matcheri S. Keshavan (eds).
