Clinical factors, along with other individual features such as functional capacity and autonomy, are key in determining COVID-19 severity in routine clinical practice [9] . However, indicators such as mortality and hospitalization can serve as proxy, and aid in decision-making for the allocation of expected resources and the development of mitigation and prevention strategies at a health system level, which also have an influence on health results in infected patients [10] ."

The epidemiological situation at the time, with an overburdened healthcare system that could not assume all the necessary hospitalizations, and a lack of overall testing capacity, impeded the use of other relevant indicators like hospital and ICU admissions during follow-up. With the improvement of testing capacity, allowing for microbiological confirmation of all COVID-19 cases, and less pressure in hospitals thanks to large-scale preventive measures (i.e., use of facemasks, confinements, quarantines, limited social reunions and contact tracing), current data on admission can be reliably studied along with mortality as an indicator of severity. While many studies focus on in-hospital mortality alone, often with self-reported diagnoses of specific chronic conditions [12] , PRECOVID is a population-based cohort that offers a holistic view of baseline comorbidity profiles and health outcomes, diagnosed and recorded in electronic health records by healthcare professionals in both in-and out-patient settings."

            "text": "This large-scale population-based study describes the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with an increased risk of severity in 68,913 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings show that, apart from old age and male sex, specific baseline Table 2 cardiovascular and metabolic conditions are common risk factors for severe infection in men and women, while other comorbidities are sex-specific. Our analyses reasserted that age is by far the most influencing factor on the vulnerability of older people to develop more severe forms of COVID-19, most notoriously when crossing the threshold of the 80s, highlighting the need for targeted prevention and early detection strategies in older age groups [16, 17] . Men were at higher risk of severity than women, a fact that has been amply reported and attributed to various causes such as lifestyle differences (e.g. smoking) or hormone differences in inflammatory processes [18] . Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities (i.e. obesity, diabetes, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure) increased the risk of severe infection in both sexes even when adjusting by age and the remaining significant comorbidities, as described in previous studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Patients with these conditions seem to be predisposed to potentially serious COVID-19 infections through common pathophysiological pathways, with chronic systemic inflammation at their center [7] . Key aspects include ACE-2-mediated endothelial injury, blood flow stasis due to immobilization, and a state of hypercoagulability induced by prothrombotic circulating factors, which contribute to the occurrence of coagulopathies and thromboembolic events, markedly increasing the risk of severe outcomes [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Arterial hypertension was abundantly associated with poor health outcomes after COVID-19 infection in early studies, but was usually reported along with potentially confounding effects such as age and other chronic conditions [30] . In our study, hypertension was not a risk factor for severity in men, and lost its significance when adjusting by the rest of comorbidities in women, supporting the theory that it entails higher risk of severity only in association with other diseases but not as an isolated condition [31] ."

Both entities had been previously identified as risk factors for poor prognosis [20] [21] [22] [23] . Chronic ulcers of the skin and urinary incontinence, usually linked to serious states of functional impairment, were also significantly associated with higher risk in our age-adjusted analysis, concurring with our previous study [11] . Anxiety, as well as dementia, delirium and other cognitive disorders were additional risk factors for severity, also only in men in our case, and further research could shed light on the benefits of including neuropsychological evaluation and rehabilitation during and after COVID-19 infection, as has been stated in the literature [41, 42] . In women, hepatic steatosis and rheumatoid arthritis were risk factors for severe outcomes. Although the association of liver disease with a more severe progression of COVID-19 has been described [43] , the role of rheumatoid arthritis remains unclear in women, highlighting the importance of age, comorbidity, disease activity and pharmacological treatments in future studies [44, 45] ."

Further studies are encouraged in the future to specifically address the potential mid-and/or long-term effects of these conditions and its treatments on COVID-19 infection severity. The interpretation of the association of menstrual disorders with severity is challenging, especially considering how varied the pathophysiology of the processes included under this denomination is (i.e., polycystic ovary, dysmenorrhea, metrorrhagia), and would also require more targeted and exhaustive studies."

To date, there is no evidence suggesting that these disorders increase the risk of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients [46] . Notwithstanding, thyroid disfunction does influence the regulation of immunity, particularly if it is cell-based. Low concentrations of thyroid hormones have been associated with increased mortality in patients with serious infectious diseases [46, 47] and could have been partly responsible for some of the more severe COVID-19 infections, seeing as 80% of those diagnosed with thyroid disorders had hypothyroidism. As far as we know, only two previous studies have analysed this hypothesis, and although both of them ruled out any significant association between hypothyroidism and COVID-19 infection severity, further studies are warranted [46, 48] ."

            "text": "Due to their low prevalence (between 0.1-0.5%), some chronic conditions were not presented in the Results section of the manuscript despite statistical significance (available as supplementary tables), and their potential impact on infection severity may have not been sufficiently analyzed. In the case of men, two inflammatory conditions were associated with higher severity: rheumatoid arthritis (in line with what was observed in women) and polymyalgia. It has been reported that autoimmune diseases are not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 progression [49] , and poor outcomes could simply be linked to older age and comorbidity [45] , though one study did find a 39% increase in the adjusted risk of hospitalization and mortality in a sample of mostly male patients with COVID-19 infection and rheumatoid arthritis [50] . In women, we found a high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with HIV infection and, although similar findings have been published in the literature, further studies are needed to better assess this risk taking into account disease control, treatment, analytical blood parameters, and comorbidity [51] [52] [53] ."

Another key feature of our study is that baseline comorbidities were not limited to the most prevalent or to those self-reported by patients, but were based on a comprehensive analysis of all the chronic diagnoses registered by physicians in their EHRs instead. Furthermore, we used open-access software with an open algorithm to manage chronic conditions in the analyses, facilitating reproducibility and comparability. Our study, however, is not free of limitations. Some sociodemographic variables, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, or clinical variables like laboratory tests results, acute respiratory distress, multi-organ failure, pharmacological treatments, or genetic profiles could have influenced infection severity or aided in the interpretation of the results, but were not available in our cohort. Moreover, the causes of hospitalization and/or death were also unavailable, and we were therefore unable to directly attribute the observed outcomes to the infection. To minimize these limitation, we assessed both outcomes in a limited time window based on clinical criteria, and excluded COVID-19 patients from the first three months of the pandemic where access to diagnostic tests and in some cases medical care was more limited. Finally, though we conducted comorbidity-adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, each chronic condition contributed independently to estimate the associated risk of severity. We know, however, that patients with more severe forms of infection are usually affected by more than one chronic disease, as was the case in our study (81% were multimorbid, with an average of 5.2 chronic conditions). Considering that chronic diseases tend to cluster into multimorbidity patterns, future studies should focus on the combined burden of coexisting conditions and the effects of their interactions on COVID-19 outcomes, as well as on the consequences of COVID-19 on patients and the healthcare system."

The presence of specific cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (i.e. heart failure, diabetes mellitus, obesity and chronic renal failure) consistently increased the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women. Results also reveal sex differences in certain disorders, such as neoplasms and acute cerebrovascular disease in men or thyroid disorders and hepatic steatosis in women, whose effects on COVID-19 severity have been less studied to date. More in-depth research on the impact of each disease and their combinations is encouraged to ascertain whether COVID-19 could act as a trigger for negative health outcomes in patients with specific multimorbidity profiles.
