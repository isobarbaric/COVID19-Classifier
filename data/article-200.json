            "text": "Tissues from four cases of Kaposi's sarcoma developing in renal transplant recipients were studied by light and electron microscopic examination and by immunoperoxidase staining for Factor-VIII-related antigen. Ultrastructurally, the tumors in all four cases contained a variable mixture of cells, including endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. These findings support the origin of Kaposi's sarcoma from primitive vasoformative mesenchyme. Immunoperoxidase staining for Factor-VIII-related antigen was limited to endothelial cells. In one case intracytoplasmic virus-like tubular complexes were seen. The significance of this finding is briefly discussed."

Whether or not the formation of CTC in our patient was in any way related to cyclosporin therapy is not clear. It may be of interest to note, however, that these complexes could not be demonstrated in the second biopsy which was performed 3 months following reduction of the cyclosporin dose. The effect in humans of prior treatment by chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive agents on the development of CTC is unknown. Similar tubular complexes have been observed in renal tubular epithelial cells in animals receiving v i n b l a~t i n e .~~ Thus, it is quite possible that the development of CTC in our case was related to cyclosporin therapy; however, experience with additional cases treated in this fashion is needed before a definite cause-and-effect relationship can be established."

Photomicrograph of an area from KS stained by immunoperoxidase technique for Factor VIIl Ag. Small vascular spaces with positive d o n within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells can be seen. Stromal cells are mostly negative (original magnification X85). entiation is rather poor, so that no exact categorization can be made. The histogenesis of KS is still controversial. Several hypotheses have been advanced with regard to the cell of origin. Pepler and Theron suggested an origin from Schwann cells on the basis of the presence of intracytoplasmic lamellated bodies which they interpreted as resembling the myelin m heath.^ These findings, however, have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. Niemi and Maskatellio suggested that the tumor is derived from pericytes, whereas Hashimoto and Lever concluded that the tumor is composed of two kinds of cells, namely endothelial and perithelial Harrison and Kahn proposed an origin from primitive mesenchymal cells which have the potential to differentiate into several specialized connective tissue cell types.' We believe that KS is derived from primitive vasoformative mesenchyme. The demonstration of myofibroblasts in our cases of KS, as well as in one previous report by Hamson and Kahn, is of interest.* Myofibroblasts may be seen in a variety of soft tissue tumors, such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma and fibromato~is.~*l~ This cell is also known to form a major component of the spindle cells in granulation tissue. I 'J' In granulation tissue there is proliferation of endothelial-lined spaces which are separated from one another by spindle-shaped cells. This structural arrangement is identical to that seen in KS. Ultrastructural studies of granulation tissue have revealed that the vascular spaces are lined by endothelial cells which are surrounded externally by welldeveloped basal lamina; these in turn may be surrounded by a layer of pericytes. The cells present within the intercapillary spaces have the ultrastructural features of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. I' Thus",
