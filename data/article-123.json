            "text": "The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a public health priority. We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: fulllength ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (S\u0394C-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines, and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S\u0394C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S\u0394C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19."

            "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population in 2019 has caused a rapidly growing pandemic that has disrupted nearly all global infrastructures. To date, there have been over 63 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nearly 1.5 million deaths worldwide. 1 While some nations have controlled viral spread through social distancing, widespread testing, and contact tracing, many nations struggle to contain the growing number of cases and are still experiencing extensive community spread. Additionally, the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into low-resource settings will lead to severe and lasting impacts on economic and healthcare systems. Long-term control of the pandemic will require one or more effective vaccines that can be made widely available across the globe."

            "text": "The primary viral target for protective antibody-based vaccines against COVID-19 is the SARS-CoV-2 spike, a trimeric surface glycoprotein responsible for viral entry. 2, 3 Importantly, COVID-19 patients have been shown to elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses directed at the SARS-CoV-2 spike, which suggests that this antigen could be promising in the context of a protective vaccine. 4, 5 The spike protein is produced as a single polypeptide and cleaved to form the S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for receptor binding (S1) and fusion with the host cell membrane (S2). 3, 6, 7 The receptor binding domain (RBD) is a 25 kDa domain of S1 that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 human receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and can form a functionally folded domain when expressed separately from the rest of S1. 8\u221210 A vast array of vaccination platforms are being employed for the development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. 11\u221219 Several vaccine candidates are currently being investigated in Phase 3 clinical trials including two mRNAbased vaccines and two virally vectored vaccines. 20\u221222 Importantly, the mRNA vaccine candidates rely on lipid\u2212 nanoparticle encapsulation and require long-term cold-chain storage (\u221220 to \u221280\u00b0C), 20, 21 leading to extensive logistical challenges for distribution and administration. Virus-based vaccines including inactivated, live-attenuated, and recombinant viral vaccines can produce robust immune responses, but are known to induce off-target vector-directed immune responses 23, 24 and can be associated with more frequent side effects and adverse events. 25, 26 Subunit vaccines, in which a protein antigen from the pathogen is used to elicit a protective antibody response, are an attractive option for an accessible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for reasons including safety, manufacturing scalability, and ease of distribution to low-and middle-income nations. 26 Though typically less immunogenic than virus-based vaccines, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccinations can be significantly increased by formulation with adjuvants. 25 It has also been demonstrated that multivalent presentation of antigens markedly enhances the immune response, 27, 28 and several nanoparticle-based platforms have been utilized to multimerize antigens of interest to improve the antibody response to subunit vaccine candidates. 27\u221230 Furthermore, two recent studies have shown that the multivalent presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD 31 as well as the spike ectodomain 32 using various multimerization platforms elicits better neutralizing antibody responses than nonmultimerized forms of the same antigens."

Additionally, we designed a second nanoparticle construct in which we deleted the Cterminal 70 residues of the ectodomain and expressed this truncated spike (residues 1\u22121143) on ferritin (S\u0394C-Fer). These C-terminal residues are unresolved in the cryo-EM structures of the spike trimer, 3, 7 and it has been suggested that they have extensive conformational flexibility based on electron microscopy of soluble trimers and viral particles. 41\u221243 Additionally, this region of the spike contains an immunodominant linear epitope, as determined via analysis of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. 44 , 45 We therefore hypothesized that deleting these residues would more readily facilitate formation of spike ferritin particles and could influence immunogenicity. As points of comparison, we also expressed and purified three additional antigens: spike trimer containing a GCN4-based trimerization domain either in full-length or S\u0394C form (denoted S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4) 46 and monomeric receptor binding domain (RBD) (Figure 1 )."

To assess the immune response in vivo, we immunized mice and characterized the antibody responses to the spike ferritin particles versus S-GCN4, S\u0394C-GCN4, and RBD. After a single dose, mice immunized with S\u0394C-Fer exhibited a significantly higher neutralizing antibody response than all nonferritin groups as determined using a spike-pseudotyped lentiviral assay. 47, 48 Importantly, immunization with a single dose of S-Fer or S\u0394C-Fer elicited at least 2-fold higher neutralizing titers Construct design for SARS-CoV-2 spike-functionalized ferritin nanoparticles. All constructs are based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 amino acid sequence (GenBank MN9089473) of SARS-CoV-2 spike. Spike-functionalized ferritin constructs were made by fusing spike ectodomain (residues 1\u22121213) or spike\u0394C (residues 1\u22121143) to the H. pylori ferritin subunit separated by an SGG linker. A structural representation based on the spike trimer cryo-EM structure (PDB 6VXX) and the H. pylori ferritin crystal structure (PDB 3BVE) depicts the 24-subunit particle displaying spike or spike\u0394C on the surface. The estimated size of the spike-functionalized ferritin particles based on structural data is \u223c300 \u00c5. The S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4 trimer constructs were made by fusing either the full-length spike residues (1\u22121213) or spike\u0394C (1\u22121137) to a modified GCN4 trimerization domain followed by a hexahistidine tag. A structural representation of the spike trimers based on the cryo-EM structure (PDB 6VXX) is shown with an estimate length of \u223c100 \u00c5. The RBD spans residues 319\u2212541 of the spike protein and is preceded by the native signal peptide (not shown) and followed by a hexahistidine tag. as those observed in plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients.

S\u0394C-GCN4 contained a deletion of residues 1138\u22121143 (which were present in S\u0394C-Fer) to eliminate a short helical segment prior to the start of the GCN4-pI Q I coiled-coil. A similar truncated version of the spike trimer was recently utilized for antibody discovery. 5 We included the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD; Figure 1 ) in our antigen panel because there is interest in employing the RBD as a potential vaccine candidate. 49, 52, 53 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticles Can Be Expressed in Mammalian Cells and Purified to Homogeneity. The SARS-CoV-2 spike is a heavily glycosylated trimeric protein that can be challenging to produce recombinantly. 3, 49, 54 Production of recombinant spike ectodomain is commonly done in mammalian cell culture systems in which the protein is glycosylated during synthesis. 54 We expressed the spike ferritin nanoparticles using human Expi293F cells. Since the ferritin subunit facilitates self-assembly of the nanoparticles, production of purified spike-functionalized particles was achieved by transfecting a single plasmid followed by a two-step chromatographic purification (Figure 2A ). After Expi293F transfection, we monitored expression levels of the four spike-based antigens (ferritins and trimers) with Western blots of cell culture supernatants probed with SARS-CoV-2 reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CR3022, 55\u221257 CB6, 58 and COVA2-15 5 ( Figure S1A ). Although fusing spike to ferritin increases the size of the antigen from \u223c450 kDa (trimer) to \u223c4 MDa (ferritin), the expression levels for all spike proteins were comparable ( Figure S1A ). Nanoparticles can sometimes remain intact during SDS-PAGE analysis, even under denaturing conditions, which can lead to retention of some sample within the well, causing the intensity of the monomer band to appear weaker. Therefore, for a more quantitative estimate of the protein levels in Expi cell culture supernatant, we quantified the expression levels of each spike antigen using a dot blot of unpurified cell culture supernatant blotted with SARS-CoV-2 mAb CR3022. We made standard curves of purified antigen and compared these curves to expression levels from cell culture supernatants from a set (n = 5) of small-scale protein expressions ( Figure S1B ). 59 This analysis indicated similar expression trends to those observed via Western blot and further confirmed that fusion of spike to H. pylori ferritin did not impact expression levels. Interestingly, it also suggests that fusion of S\u0394C to ferritin enhances the levels of protein expression under these conditions."

We purified these samples using NiNTA purification followed by size-exclusion chromatography and confirmed sample purity and homogeneity using SEC-MALS ( Figure S2C ). We observed a main peak and a secondary peak for the S-GCN4 sample, which has also been noted in other recently reported work describing expression Binding of all antigens to three SARS-CoV-2 reactive mAbs indicates that spike ferritin nanoparticles display epitopes similarly to the RBD and spike trimers. Curves were fitted with an association/dissociation nonlinear regression, and fits are represented with dashed black lines; k on values for each binding reaction are shown in Figure S4A . Both S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer exhibited a slight increase in signal during the dissociation step, perhaps due to rearrangements of the particles on the BLI sensor tip due to the extensive avidity present on the multimerized particles. Lack of binding to an off-target Ebola-specific antibody (ADI-15731) is presented in Figure S4B . Binding experiments were performed in at least duplicate; a representative trace and fit are shown from one replicate. . Immunization with S\u0394C-Fer nanoparticles elicits a stronger neutralizing response than immunization with nonferritin groups in mice. (A) Immunization schedule including a priming dose with 10 \u03bcg of antigen at day 0 and a boost with 10 \u03bcg of antigen at day 21. Serum was collected on days 0, 21, and 28. Both doses were adjuvanted with 10 \u03bcg of Quil-A and 10 \u03bcg of MPLA in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL per mouse administered via subcutaneous injection. (B) ELISA binding titers to both the RBD and full-length spike ectodomain after a single dose of antigen demonstrate that all groups elicited a SARS-CoV-2-directed antibody response following immunization. Each point represents the EC 50 titer from a single animal; each bar represents the mean EC 50 titer from the group (n = 10 mice per group). Error bars represent standard deviation. Points with signal less than EC 50 1:100 dilution are placed at the limit of quantitation for the assay. (C) S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer antigens elicit stronger neutralizing antibody responses than spike trimers alone or RBD, as indicated by spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralizing titers after a single dose of antigen. Immunization with a single dose of S-Fer or S\u0394C-Fer elicits neutralizing responses that are at least 2-fold greater on average than those found in plasma from 20 convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCP). Each point represents the IC 50 titer from a single animal or patient; each bar represents the mean IC 50 titer from each group (n = 10 per group, with the exception of CCP which is n = 20). Error bars represent standard deviation. Samples with neutralizing activity that was undetectable at 1:50 dilution or with an IC 50 less than 1:100 dilution are placed at the limit of quantitation. (D) ELISA binding titers to the RBD and spike after two doses of antigen show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific response against both antigens was boosted in all groups. Groups and error are as defined in part B. (E) Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization following two doses of antigen indicates that although all groups had a neutralizing response following two doses, animals immunized with S\u0394C-Fer have the highest neutralizing titers, and these are significantly greater than S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4. Groups and error are as defined in part C. Statistical comparisons for panels B\u2212E were performed using Kruskal\u2212Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons.

To confirm that spike is displayed on the surface of ferritin, we performed cryo-EM on both S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer. Cryo-EM raw images showed observable densities around ferritin particles ( Figure 3A and Figure S3A ), indicating proper formation of the nanoparticles and display of spike on the surface. The two-dimensional class averages further showed the densities of spike surrounding ferritin ( Figure 3B and Figure  S3B ). We chose to perform additional data collection and image processing of the S\u0394C-Fer particles since they had more defined spike density than the S-Fer particles. Using singleparticle analysis, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the S\u0394C-Fer complex from \u223c60 000 particles and achieved overall resolutions of 13.5 and 23.6 \u00c5, with and without octahedral symmetry applied, respectively ( Figure  S3C \u2212E). The overall shapes of the two cryo-EM maps were very similar, with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.99 ( Figure  S3D ,E). The map obtained with octahedral symmetry can be seen in two different views in Figure 3C . One representative trimer on the surface is highlighted, with each protomer indicated in a separate color to demonstrate the display of trimeric spike on the surface of ferritin."

Indeed, when singleparticle analysis of the S\u0394C-Fer cryo-EM data set focused on only the ferritin core, excluding spike-specific density, we were able to obtain a 3.7 \u00c5 resolution structure of the ferritin core of S\u0394C-Fer ( Figure S3F )."

We used BLI ( Figure 3D ) to assess binding of three SARS-CoV-2 mAbs (CR3022, COVA2-15, and CB6) in IgG form to S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer. We performed the BLI experiments at a set concentration of 100 nM monomer for each antigen which corresponds to 100 nM RBD monomer, 33.3 nM S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4 trimer, and 4.2 nM S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer 24-mer ferritin nanoparticle. Thus, observed differences in the magnitude of binding are largely due to differences in molar concentration of antigen. We fit the BLI data using an association/dissociation nonlinear regression and extracted k on values for each mAb binding each antigen ( Figure S4A ). We could not obtain k off values for a subset of the binding interactions due to the undetectable dissociation of IgGs from the highly avid spike ferritin nanoparticle samples ( Figure 3D ). Thus, we did not determine K D values for mAbs binding to each antigen but used the k on values as a metric to compare binding ( Figure S4A ). The mAbs bound the functionalized nanoparticles similarly to both the spike trimers and the RBD ( Figure 3D and Figure S4A ), confirming that display of the spike on ferritin nanoparticles does not perturb or occlude critical conformation-specific epitopes. We observed minimal binding when a nontarget mAb (anti-Ebola glycoprotein mAb, ADI-15731 63 ) was loaded on the tip ( Figure S4B ). We also compared binding of the three mAbs as well as the ectodomain of human ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, to all antigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Figure S5 ). These ELISA results were consistent with those from BLI, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 bind the spike-functionalized particles as well as they bind spike trimers and RBD."

The immune response to all antigens was increased, and antigen-specific titers for both RBD and spike were similar among groups after the second dose ( Figure 4D ). ACE2 blocking activity was notably enhanced after the boost, and all five antigen groups had nearly complete ACE2 blocking at 1:50 serum dilution at that time point ( Figure S7, right) . While all antigen groups also had partial ACE2 blocking activity at 1:500 serum dilution, the levels of ACE2 blocking at this dilution did not relate to overall trends in neutralizing titers (compare Figure 4E and Figure  S7 ).

We observed anti-H. pylori ferritin responses in the S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer groups that were similar and were equivalent to or less than anti-RBD and anti-spike titers from the same groups as determined by ELISA ( Figure  S9, left) . The S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4 groups had similar anti-GCN4 responses ( Figure S9 , middle), suggesting that the H. pylori ferritin and GCN4 domains are equivalently immunogenic. Interestingly, when we probed the anti-His-tag response specifically, we observed that the S\u0394C-GCN4 group had a notably higher His-tag response as compared to either the S-GCN4 or the RBD group, even though all three antigens contained His-tags ( Figure S9, right) . This could suggest that this antigen either was less structurally stable or had other antigenic features that altered the overall immunogenicity to cause a higher tag-directed response. Additionally, this indicates that, for the RBD-and spike-specific titers from the S-GCN4, S\u0394C-GCN4, and RBD groups, the His-tag on the plated antigen likely did not impact the overall titers for the S-GCN4 and RBD groups but may have slightly increased the titers for the S\u0394C-GCN4 group."

Importantly, the variation in response to the nonferritin groups was also considerably larger than the variability detected in mice immunized with S-Fer or S\u0394C-Fer nanoparticles ( Figure 4E) , suggesting that the multivalent presentation of spike facilitated a more consistent immune response. Furthermore, the neutralizing antibody response elicited by S\u0394C-Fer shows dose-dependent trends ( Figure  S10A ). Though a decrease in dose from 10 to 1 \u03bcg led to an increased variability in the elicitation of neutralizing titers, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in a subset of mice following only 1 \u03bcg of S\u0394C-Fer could have important dosesparing implications. Additionally, neutralizing titers remain stable even to 20 weeks following a single immunization with 20 \u03bcg (Figure S10B ), demonstrating that this formulation may successfully achieve neutralizing antibody levels that persist in the months following vaccination. These data demonstrate that the spike ferritin nanoparticles presented here, particularly S\u0394C-Fer, are superior vaccine candidates to spike trimer or RBD alone."

We built on existing work using ferritin nanoparticles to display other viral antigens for vaccine development 30,33\u221238 and designed nanoparticles displaying the SARS-Cov-2 spike ectodomain. Importantly, the two ferritin-based antigens that we designed (S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer) expressed comparably to spike trimers (S-GCN4 and S\u0394C-GCN4) in mammalian cells ( Figure S1 ), indicating that fusing the spike to ferritin does not negatively impact protein production. As glycosylation can influence proper folding of viral antigens, it is also noteworthy that expression was achieved in mammalian cells, which allows spike proteins to be produced with native-like glycosylation. 54 These constructs could also be important for the development of nucleic acid vaccines given the self-assembly of spike ferritin nanoparticles following production in mammalian cells, expression levels comparable to those of spike trimers, and the enhanced immune response after a single dose of antigen. We administered equivalent doses of spike ferritin nanoparticle and trimer and observed an enhanced response after single-dose and two-dose vaccine regimens with the S\u0394C-Fer ( Figure  4C ,E). Thus, administration of a nucleic acid vaccine encoding a multimerized ferritin-based spike protein could potentially elicit a heightened response versus constructs encoding spike alone, although we did not test that hypothesis here."

These data clearly demonstrate that equivalent doses of spike ferritin nanoparticles elicit a better neutralizing response versus RBD or trimer alone in a single-dose setting which is consistent with observations from other recent studies investigating other multimerized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms. 31 ,32 A comparison of neutralizing antibody titers observed in these other studies reveals that, despite the use of different adjuvants, the spike ferritin nanoparticles we present here elicit similar levels of neutralizing antibodies following one or two doses. 31, 32 Mice immunized with the RBD exhibited no observable serum neutralizing activity after a single dose ( Figure 4C ) despite having RBD-specific antibody titers that were similar to those in other groups ( Figure 4B ). This discordance suggests that RBD binding titers may not be a strong correlate of neutralizing antibody responses in the context of vaccination, particularly for candidates based on the RBD alone. 52, 79, 80 Notably, the full-length spike ELISA binding titers from animals immunized with the RBD were significantly lower than titers from the other groups ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that immunization with monomeric RBD elicits antibodies to epitopes that are occluded in full-length spike, rendering them unable to neutralize virus. This supports the notion that the response to RBD may have largely focused on the nonneutralizing regions."

Here, we have demonstrated that a dose of either S-Fer or S\u0394C-Fer nanoparticles adjuvanted with Quil-A and MPLA was sufficient to achieve neutralizing titers greater than those in plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Additionally, both S-Fer and S\u0394C-Fer form nanoparticles spontaneously following expression in mammalian cells without the need for a conjugation step, showcasing the potential application of spike ferritin constructs to nucleic acidbased vaccine strategies.

Six million cells were seeded in D10 medium (DMEM + additives: 10% fetal bovine serum, Lglutamate, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES) in 10 cm plates 1 day prior to transfection. A five-plasmid system 47 was used for viral production: the lentiviral packaging vector (pHAGE_Luc2_IRES_ZsGreen), the SARS-CoV-2 spike, and lentiviral helper plasmids (HDM-Hgpm2, HDM-Tat1b, and pRC-CMV_Rev1b). The spike vector contained the full-length wild-type spike sequence from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank NC_045512). Plasmids were added to filter-sterilized water as follows: 10 \u03bcg of pHAGE_Lu-c2_IRS_ZsGreen, 3.4 \u03bcg of SARS-CoV-2 spike, 2.2 \u03bcg of HDM-Hgpm2, 2.2 \u03bcg of HDM-Tat1b, and 2.2 \u03bcg of pRC-CMV_Rev1b in a final volume of 500 \u03bcL. HEPES-buffered Saline (2\u00d7, pH 7.0) was added dropwise to this mixture to a final volume of 1 mL. To form transfection complexes, 100 \u03bcL of 2.5 M CaCl 2 was added dropwise while the solution was gently agitated. Transfection reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then added dropwise to plated cells. Medium was removed \u223c24 h post-transfection and replaced with fresh D10 medium. Virus-containing culture supernatants were harvested \u223c72 h post-transfection via centrifugation at 300g for 5 min and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use."

Mouse serum was centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min, heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C, and diluted in D10 medium. Virus was diluted in D10 medium, supplemented with Polybrene, and then added to inhibitor dilutions. Polybrene was present at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL in diluted samples. Purified mAbs were filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter prior to neutralization assays. Virus/inhibitor dilutions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After incubation, medium was removed from cells, replaced with an equivalent volume of inhibitor/virus dilutions, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for \u223c48 h. Cells were lysed by adding BriteLite assay readout solution (PerkinElmer), and luminescence values were measured with a BioTek plate reader. Each plate was normalized by averaging RLUs from wells with cells only (0% infectivity) and virus only (100% infectivity). Normalized values were fitted with a threeparameter nonlinear regression inhibitor curve in GraphPad Prism 8.4.1 to obtain IC 50 values. Fits for all serum neutralization assays were constrained to have a value of 0% at the bottom of the fit. The limit of quantitation for this assay is approximately 1:100 serum dilution. Serum samples that failed to neutralize or that neutralized at levels higher than 1:100 were set at the limit of quantitation for statistical analyses. Plots in Figure 4B \u2212E are shown starting at the reciprocal serum dilution of the limit of quantitation (10 2 )."
