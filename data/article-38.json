Although this insight was also motivated by artificial intelligence, in hindsight it was the birth of the field of computer science. There was great optimism that the manipulation of symbols, in programs written by humans, implementing rules designed by humans, should be enough to generate intelligence. Below, we shall refer to this as the symbol-rule hypothesis. 1 There was initially encouraging progress on seemingly hard problems such as automatic theorem proving and computer chess. One of the fathers of the field, Herb Simon, predicted in 1956 that \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\" However, problems that appeared simple, such as most things animals could do, turned out to be hard. This came to be known as Moravec's paradox. When IBM's Deep Blue Given a distribution over the U i , which are assumed independent, this also gives rise to a probabilistic model p(X). However, the model in (1.1) is more structured: the graph connectivity and the functions f i create particular dependences between the observables. Moreover, it describes how the system behaves under intervention: by replacing functions by constants, we can compute the effect of setting some variables to specific values.",

He argued that we would not call this a law of nature, because no matter how the points are distributed, there always exists such an equation; we would only call it a law of nature only if the equation is simple. This raises the question of what makes an equation simple. The physicist Rutherford took the pragmatic view that if there is a law, it should be directly evident from the data: \"if your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.\" 3 This view may have been a healthy one Figure 1 : Given a small number of observations, how do we find a law underlying them?

Statistical learning Figure 3 : Measurements of two genes (x-axis), gene A (left) and gene B (right), show the same strong positive correlation with a phenotype (y-axis). However, this statistical information alone is insufficient to predict the outcome of a knock-out experiment where the activity of a gene is set to zero (vertical lines at x = 0). Answering such interventional questions requires additional causal knowledge (inset causal graphs): knocking out gene A, which is a direct cause, would lead to a reduction in phenotype, whereas knocking out gene B, which shares a common cause, or confounder, with the phenotype but has no causal effect on it, would leave the phenotype unaffected. This shows that correlation alone is not enough to predict the outcome of perturbations to a system (toy data, figure from [112] ).",

Vision systems can be grossly misled if an object that is normally recognized with high accuracy is placed in a context that in the training set may be negatively correlated with the presence of the object. For instance, such a system may fail to recognize a cow standing on the beach. In order to successfully generalize in such settings, we would need to construct systems which do not merely rely on statistical dependences, but instead model mechanisms that are robust across certain violations of the i.i.d. assumption.

The statistical structure is an epiphenomenon that follows if we make the unexplained variables random. It is awkward to talk about the (statistical) information contained in a mechanism, since deterministic functions in the generic case neither generate nor destroy information. This motivated us to devise an algorithmic model of causal structures in terms of Kolmogorov complexity [66] . The Kolmogorov complexity (or algorithmic information) of a bit string is essentially the length of its shortest compression on a Turing machine, and thus a measure of its information content. Independence of mechanisms can be defined as vanishing mutual algorithmic information: two conditionals are considered independent if knowing (the shortest compression of) one does not help achieve a shorter compression of the other one.",

Similar to the statistical case, one can define a local causal Markov condition, a global one in terms of d-separation, and a decomposition of the joint Kolmogorov complexity in analogy to (4.1), and prove that they are implied by the SCM [66] . This approach shows that concepts of causality are not intrinsically tied to statistics: causality is about mechanisms governing flow of information which may or may not be statistical. The assumption of algorithmically independent mechanisms has interesting implications for physics: it implies the second law of thermodynamics (i.e., the arrow of time). Consider a process where an incoming ordered beam of photons (the cause) is scattered by an object (the mechanism). Then the outgoing beam (the effect) contains information about the object. Microscopically, the time evolution is reversible; however, the photons contain information about the object only after the scattering. What underlies Loschmidt's paradox [86] ?",

How about the opposite direction? Is there hope that semi-supervised learning should be possible in that case? It turns out the answer is yes, due to work on cause-effect inference using the ICM Principle 5.1 [24] . It introduced a measure of dependence between the input and the conditional of output given input, and showed that if this dependence is zero in the causal direction, then it is strictly positive in the opposite direction. Independence of cause and mechanism in the causal direction thus implies that in the backward direction (i.e., for anticausal learning), the distribution of the input variable should contain information about the conditional of output given input, i.e., the quantity that machine learning is usually concerned with. This is exactly the kind of information that semi-supervised learning requires when trying to improve the estimate of output given input by using unlabeled inputs. This suggests that semi-supervised learning should be impossible for causal learning problems, but feasible otherwise, in particular for anticausal ones. A meta-analysis of published semi-supervised learning benchmark studies corroborated this prediction [130] , and similar results apply for natural language processing [69] . These findings are intriguing since they provide insight into physical properties of learning problems, thus going beyond the methods and applications that machine learning studies usually provide.",

In the simplest setting, the assignment of treatment or control is determined by whether an observed score S is above a threshold s 0 , T := I{S \u2265 s 0 }. This score in turn depends on other covariates which may or may not be observed. For example, patients may be assigned a risk score, and treatment is only prescribed if this score surpasses a given threshold. Since the score may be assigned by another institution, not all relevant covariates H are usually observed. However, it is assumed that the treatment decision only depends on the score, e.g., because doctors comply with the official rules. The causal graph for such a simple RDD setting is shown in Fig. 10c . While the score S constitutes a valid adjustment set in principle, the problem with RDDs is the lack of overlap: patients with low scores are always assigned T = 0 and patients with high scores are always assigned T = 1. Because of this, covariate adjustment, matching, or weighting approaches do not apply. The general idea of an RDD is to overcome this challenge by comparing observations with score in a small neighborhood of the decision cut-off value s 0 , motivated by the consideration that patients with close scores but on opposite sides of s 0 differ only in whether they received the treatment or not. For example, if the treatment cut-off value is 0.5 for a score in [0,1], then patients with scores of 0.49 and 0.51 are comparable and can be treated as samples from an RCT. An RDD (in its simplest form) thus focuses on differences in the regression function",

Launched in 2009, NASA's Kepler space telescope initially observed 150000 stars over four years, in search of exoplanet transits. These are events where a planet partially occludes its host star, causing a slight decrease in brightness, often orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of telescope errors. When looking at stellar light curves, we noticed that the noise structure was often shared across stars that were light years apart. Since that made direct interaction of the stars impossible, it was clear that the shared information was due to the telescope acting as a confounder. We thus devised a method that (a) regresses a given star of interest on a large set of other stars chosen such that their measurements contain no information about the star's astrophysical signal, and (b) removes that regression in order to cancel the telescope's influence. 13 The method is called \"half-sibling\" regression since target and predictors share a parent, namely the telescope. The method recovers the random variable representing the astrophysical signal almost surely (up to a constant offset), for an additive noise model (specifically, the observed light curve is a sum of the unknown astrophysical signal and an unknown function of the telescope noise), subject to the assumption that the telescope's effect on the star is in principle predictable from the other stars [128] .",

The profound modern understanding of energy came with Emmy Noether and the insight that energy conservation is due to a symmetry (or covariance) of the fundamental laws of physics: they look the same no matter how we shift time. One might argue that information, suitably conceptualized, should also be a conserved quantity, and that this might also be a consequence of symmetries.

The task of identifying suitable units that admit causal models aligns with the general goal of modern machine learning to learn meaningful representations for data, where meaningful can mean robust, transferable, interpretable, explainable, or fair [77, 72, 162, 71, 70, 155] .

One approach is to try to learn the generative causal model (10.1) and (10.3), or its reduced form (10.4), using an auto-encoder approach [73] . An auto-encoder consists of an encoder function q : R d \u2192 R n which maps X to a latent \"bottleneck\" representation (e.g., comprising the unexplained noise variables U), and a decoder function\u011d : R n \u2192 R d mapping back to the observations. For example, the decoder may directly implement the composition\u011d = g \u2022 f RF from (10.4). Alternatively, it could consist of multiple modules, implementing (10.1) and (10.3) separately. A standard procedure to train such an auto-encoder architecture is to minimise the reconstruction error, i.e., to satisfy\u011d \u2022 q \u2248 id on a training set of observations of X. As discussed, this alone is insufficient, so to make it causal we can impose additional constraints on the structure of the decoder [80] and try to make the causal mechanisms independent by ensuring that they are invariant across problems and can be independently intervened upon. For example, if we intervene on the causal variables S i or noise distribution p U in our model of (10.3) or (10.4), respectively, this should still produce \"valid\" observations, as assessed, e.g., by the discriminator of a generative adversarial network [38] . While we ideally want to manipulate the causal variables, another way to intervene is to replace noise variables with the corresponding values computed from other input images, a procedure that has been referred to as hybridization [11] . Alternatively, if we have access to multiple environments, i.e., datasets collected under different conditions, we could rely on the Sparse Mechanism Shift Principle 5.2 by requiring that changes can be explained by shifts in only a few of the p(S i | PA i ).",

            "text": "Discriminative Approach: Self-Supervised Causal Representation Learning. A different machine learning approach for unsupervised representation learning, that is not based on generative modeling but is discriminative in nature, is self-supervised learning with data augmentation. Here, the main idea is to apply some hand-crafted transformations to the observation to generate augmented views that are thought to share the main semantic characteristics with the original observation (e.g., random crops or blurs for images). One then directly learns a representation by maximizing the similarity across encodings of views related to each other by augmentations, while enforcing diversity across those of unrelated views. In recent work [156] , we set out to better understand this approach theoretically, as well as to investigate its potential for learning causal representations. Starting from (10.1), we postulate a latent causal model of the form S c \u2192 S s , where S c is a (potentially multivariate) content variable, defined as the high-level semantic part of the representation S = (S c , S s ) that is assumed invariant across views; and S s is a (potentially multivariate) style variable, defined as the remaining part of the representation that may change. Within this setting, data augmentations have a natural interpretation as counterfactuals under a hypothetical intervention on the style variables, given the original view. It can be shown that in this case, subject to some technical assumptions, common contrastive selfsupervised learning algorithms [19, 99, 45] as well as appropriately constrained generative models isolate, or recover, the true content variables S c up to an invertible transformation. By extending this approach to use multiple augmented views of the same observation, and linking these to different counterfactuals in the underlying latent SCM, it may be possible to recover a more-fine grained causal representation.",

We also explored [40] to what extent the ICM Principle 5.1 may be useful for unsupervised representation learning tasks such as (10.1), particularly for imposing additional constraints on the mixing function g. It turns out that independence between p(S) and the mixing g-measured, e.g., as discussed in \u00a7 5 in the context of Fig. 6 and [64]-does not impose nontrivial constraints when S is not observed, even when the S i are assumed independent as in ICA. However, by thinking of each S i as independently influencing the observed distribution, we postulate another type of independence between the partial derivatives \u2202g \u2202Si of the mixing g which has a geometric interpretation as an orthogonality condition on the columns of the Jacobian of g. The resulting independent mechanism analysis (IMA) approach rules out some of the common examples of non-identifiability of nonlinear ICA [58, 82] mentioned above. Since IMA does not require independent sources, it may also be a useful constraint for causal representation learning algorithms.",

However, natural intelligence excels at generalizing across tasks and settings. Suppose we want to build a system that can solve multiple tasks in multiple environments. If we view learning as data compression, it would make sense for that system to utilize components that apply across tasks and environments, and thus need to be stored only once [126] .",

This concerns training data, i.e., we only have limited data for each individual task/domain, and thus need to find ways of pooling/re-using data, in stark contrast to the current industry practice of large-scale labelling work done by humans. It also concerns computational resources: animals have constraints on the resources (e.g., space, energy) used by their brains, and evolutionary neuroscience knows examples where brain regions get re-purposed. Similar constraints apply as machine learning systems get embedded in physical devices that may be small and battery-powered. Versatile AI models that robustly solve a range of problems in the real world will thus likely need to re-use components, which requires that the components are robust across tasks and environments [129, 131] . This calls for a structure whose modules are maximally reusable. An elegant way to do this would be to employ a modular structure that mirrors modularity that exists in the world. In other words, if the are mechanisms at play in the world play similar roles across a range of environments, tasks, and settings, then it would be prudent for a model to employ corresponding computational modules [39] . For instance, if variations of natural lighting (the position of the sun, clouds, etc.) imply that the visual environment can appear in brightness conditions spanning several orders of magnitude, then visual processing algorithms in our nervous system should employ methods that can factor out these variations, rather than building separate sets of object recognizers for every lighting condition. If our brain were to model the lighting changes by a gain control mechanism, say, then this mechanism in itself need not have anything to do with the physical mechanisms bringing about brightness differences. It would, however, play a role in a modular structure that corresponds to the role the physical mechanisms play in the world's modular structure-in other words, it would represent the physical mechanism. Searching for the most versatile yet compact models would then automatically produce a bias towards models that exhibit certain forms of structural isomorphy to a world that we cannot directly recognize.",

Going forward, causality will play a major role in taking representation learning to the next level, moving beyond the representation of statistical dependence structures towards models that support intervention, planning, and reasoning. This would realize Konrad Lorenz' notion of thinking as acting in an imagined space.

Such a speed-up can qualitatively change the usability of a model: for instance, we have recently built a system to map gravitational wave measurements to a probability distribution of physical parameters of a black hole merger event, including sky position [27] . The fact that this model only requires seconds to evaluate makes it possible to immediately start electromagnetic follow-up observations using telescopes as soon as a gravitational wave event has been detected, enabling analysis of transient events.",
