            "text": "The EU-China relationship is entering a period of readjustment. On the one hand, the US-China trade war has forced China to seek closer alignment with the EU, and on the other hand, the EU has chosen a more proactive approach to tame China's global and regional assertiveness. The European readjustment has been particularly noticeable in areas like connectivity, investment and 5G. China has noticed the European change of attitude and relates it to European uncertainties and misinterpretation of China's development. While the new European leadership was supposed to meet their Chinese counterparts in 2020 and work out a new modus operandi, the global coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated underlying tensions in the relationship. A comprehensive deepening of the EU-China strategic partnership looks unlikely and cooperation is expected to be increasingly selective."

At the same time, China's growing influence through sub-regional arrangements and perceived prowess to manipulate European unity has made Brussels more apprehensive. A European response to China's actions started to emerge in 2016 with the publication of a new China strategy paper, and was reflected in new policy initiatives, such as EU's connectivity initiative. Until 2019, the changing EU stance towards China was rather low profile and indirect, but this has changed with the publication of the strong-worded Strategic Outlook and the implementation of an EU investment screening framework."

The 2016 and 2017 EU-China summit meetings did not produce a joint statement, due to disagreements over trade affairs and the question of China's market economy status. Things only began to change when the USA under President Donald Trump started to impose tariffs on Chinese imports in January 2018. China realized it urgently needed to improve its relationship with the EU, in order to prevent a simultaneous deterioration of the relationships with its most important trading partners."

Unsurprisingly, Chinese officials immediately rejected the term \"rival\" and linked it to a Cold War thinking (Vinocur and Cerulus n.d.) . But while until late 2018, Chinese officials would still suggest to see each other as partners instead of competitors, they started to increasingly accept the formerly disputed term \"competition\", and included it into their diplomatic talk, but with an emphasis on \"healthy competition\" instead of \"vicious competition\"."

Chinese experts point out China's stability and continuity when describing China's attitude towards the EU.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry commented in cryptic words that it hopes the EU will \"play a constructive role in advancing the Eurasian connectivity and send out the positive signal of promoting economic cooperation among the Eurasian countries\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China 2020). Chinese experts do not see it as a challenge to the BRI, but more as a recognition of it. In general, they identify more convergence than divergence in the connectivity plans and see it as a part of a broad Asia policy framework, which will shape EU-China relations. However, as two academics cautioned, should one side read too much into \"strategic intentions\" or \"deliberately distort\" the initiatives, bridging the two connectivity initiatives might become very difficult, and it could eventually become a new point of disagreement between the two actors (Fang and Yin 2019) ."

They point out the relative weakness of the framework compared with similar ones in the USA or Australia, and they expect Chinese investment into the EU to grow and to also flow into European high-tech sectors. However, experts are wary of the implications the Europe-wide screening might have for Chinese investment, for it could trigger more restrictions and the establishment of screening mechanisms in more member states as well as increase the sensitivity of Chinese investments into the EU (Hu 2019). More importantly, they see the investment screening as a part of a larger European policy readjustment, in which Europe choses \"selective trade protectionism\" instead of \"unilateral market openness\" (Ye 2019)."

Since then, the EU has published two reports on the possible risks and mitigation of risks regarding cybersecurity. The reports particularly highlight the risks regarding close links between the supplier of telecommunication equipment and a government of a third country. Despite the clear China reference, the issue is far from settled and several member states are undecided whether or not to allow Huawei to participate in the public tender.

To underline this point, Chinese ambassadors in several European countries have made public efforts to defend Huawei and even offered veiled threats, stating that in case European lawmakers decide to not allow Huawei to participate in building 5G networks in Europe, European countries might expect retaliation (Shi 2019) ."

In this context, some experts see Europe striving for strategic autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the USA, while others warn about the consequences of siding with the Americans, for such an inclination could possibly be the beginning of a new Cold War (Cui 2019b )."

Not only has it prevented a first meeting of the new European leadership with their Chinese counterparts in late March, it has also exposed a high dependence on Chinese produced medical equipment and highlighted China's diplomatic assertiveness. While European member states were struggling to contain the spread of the virus, China stepped in and very visibly provided medical supplies to severely affected European countries. Initially, China's response was welcomed by the EU, despite it bypassing EU institutions, but its positive image as a generous partner was subsequently tainted, when some Chinese officials deliberately promoted conspiracy theories, aggressively spread disinformation and lobbied European politicians to publicly laud China's management of the crisis."

China criticizes the \"politicization of cooperation to combat the epidemic\", but this does not apply to the promotion of its own political concepts, since Chinese officials have openly advanced the notion of \"a community of shared future\" in response to the pandemic (Xinhua 2020) . This can be seen as an attempt to claim discourse power and shape the international crisis-management narrative according to China's image. This tale also handily passes over questions regarding shortcomings in China's own handling of the crisis during the early stages of the outbreak."

Shortly after the outbreak of the virus, several EU and member state officials called for reducing reliance on China for medical supplies and for relocating production and supply chains. At the same time, some member states have tightened investment screening regulations and the EU Competition Commissioner has recommended buying stakes in key companies, if necessary, to forestall possible takeovers by Chinese companies."

A prominent CASS researcher points out that a largescale relocation seems unlikely, but the question ultimately depends on how both sides cooperate during the crisis (Zhou 2020)."

The EU leadership change has ushered into a new period of difficult readjustment of the bloc's relationship with China. The EU aspires to become a geopolitical power, it has made China a priority on its ambitious agenda and it seeks to stress the geopolitical and strategic dimensions of the EU-China relationship over the trade and economic one. Similarly, Chinese officials have on many occasions stated that they will prioritize the relationship with the EU in 2020, and announced that the relationship has reached a \"new historical starting point\" (Wang Yiwei 2019) . Nevertheless, it is debatable if China has the same aspiration to upgrade the relationship's geopolitical and strategic dimension, since often times, in the Chinese discussion, the trade and economic relationship is equalled to or is identified as being \"strategic\". Furthermore, with high-level diplomatic arrangements in a state of limbo due to the impact of the global pandemic, it is doubtful whether the relationship will achieve the envisioned upgrade in (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China 2019b)."

One group of experts expects the relationship to become more strained, due to a continued toughening up of European policy towards China. However, unlike the USA, they expect that the EU will not directly confront China, but be more indirect and ambiguous about its pushback. The possible extension of power by the EU institutions is identified by one expert as the biggest danger for a regression in the relationship (Yiwei 2019) . Striking a more optimistic note, another group claims that despite current problems, the bilateral trade will stabilize the relationship and converging interests on multilateralism and free trade will provide enough opportunities for cooperation. (Zhou and Jin n.d.) . Some experts hold the opinion that the management of the pandemic can be an opportunity to promote the development of the relationship and to eliminate prejudice against China. Europe's quest for strategic autonomy is usually regarded as positive, since it could lead to a reduction in reliance on the USA-which fits into China's longheld dream of Europe as an independent pole in a multipolar world."

However, one cannot help but notice the cognitive dissonance between what China says and China does, or promises to do. It wants open access to the European market and warns the EU about discriminating against Chinese companies, but does not live up to its language regarding its own market access. Furthermore, China complains about politicizing cyber security, while at the same time heavily censors its own Internet under the premise of \"cyber sovereignty\". Finally, it points out that a united Europe is in its interest, while bypassing the EU during its coronavirus \"mask diplomacy\", threatening the said unity."

Despite the ceasefire in the US-China trade war, the US-China relationship shows clear signs of further deterioration since the outbreak of the crisis. This could lead to a stronger Chinese orientation towards the EU, eventually benefiting EU's negotiation position regarding the conclusion of an investment agreement by the end of 2020. However, given the uncertainties about the overall damage to the European economy due to the virus and the divisions within the EU exposed by the crisis and exploited by China, the EU has to overcome its own internal inconsistencies and reevaluate a strategic hierarchy of policy goals it wants to achieve with China."
