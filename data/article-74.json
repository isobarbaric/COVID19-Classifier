They are required to respect the performance and safety constraints of the underlying system context (6.0.1). The information (1.3.4) demands on the optimisation layer are high, requiring a full understanding of the underlying system, the planned service, contingency plans, current status and the predicted future state of the system. The optimising layer is above the supervisory layer and represents a more complex level of control. This complexity may be a result of a large-scale operation, integrating dissimilar functions, or interpreting complex (or ambiguous) data (or some combination of these). The distinction between the reflex and supervisory layers is the judgement or knowledge of the clinician that must be applied, particularly in degraded or emergency situations. Supervisory systems are characterised by the need to support the judgement of the actor. The supervisory layer is predominantly downward-looking, viewing the performance of the lower levels."

A narrative outline of the ICP begins with a Patient appointment with a GP.

The Patient is seen at the outpatient clinic, assessed and placed on one or more ICPs. Treatment may require the Patient to be admitted to the Hospital. For this narrative, the Patient is assumed to require treatment under several ICPs, one of which is a 'management' ICP where the best interests of the Patient are coordinated between any possible competing treatments and their overlapping side effects. The instantiation of an ICP is initiated by a Clinician. The management ICP provides a framework and hierarchy, that is populated from the ICP catalogue. A Clinician is appointed as the owner of the 'management' ICP to ensure oversight of the subordinate ICPs (to ensure non-interference and execution maintains a proper sequence). On completion, the Clinician discharges the Patient to the GP (Primary Care). An outline of an ICP metamodel includes the following: 1. Objective: an extensive list of healthcare requirements, components, data and treatments required to provide care.

This ability requires vertical integration of flexible and reconfigurable metamodels. These requirements also apply to ICP metamodels. Consider a basic ICP that consists of GP health screening, referral to secondary care and treatment, leading to discharge to primary care. In past implementations, the input would be wholly dependent on awareness of the patient to seek treatment. Two examples of healthcare vertical integration are explored here. Firstly, a vaccination programme is used to inoculate children against a range of treatable and childhood diseases. This has the effect of reducing future demand by reducing or eradicating the incidence of those diseases. Secondly, a programme of health screening on at-risk groups is used to identify conditions in their early stages, where they are more treatable. Figure 25 .3 illustrates vertical integration using a simplified supplier, secondary and tertiary delivery, and primary provision model to facilitate the integration discussion. "

Major incident response (S.13) invokes the provisions of the Civil Contingencies act [261, 262] in the execution of a rehearsed preplanned response (S.13.1.2). Risk-based response planning considers how the SRM is changed by the incident and the response to it. The incident response creates concentric zones around the geographic location(s) of the incident. In traversing each zone towards the epicentre the risk profile increases, additional hazards need to be managed and therefore require different SRMs. Based on the Common Recognised Information Picture (CRIP), the Incident Manager creates and maintains the Incident Record (S.13.1.3). The Civil Contingencies Guidance [262] describes the required organisation of the emergency services (Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance). Table 25 .9 describes the NHS Incident Level as the basis for the mobilisation of healthcare emergency response."
