Unlike for other machines, the use of wired networks is not possible in the case of AGV, which have to move through large internal and external areas. On the other hand, production support algorithms based on machine learning require huge volume of data provided by AGV. In this way, a communication with AGV, becomes convergent rather with IoT than with the classical industrial communication. In this context, artificial intelligence that is based on supervised machine learning can be used to optimise the internal logistical tasks that are performed by AGV. This requires a multi-criteria optimisation that takes into account the multiple goals that are connected with the requirements to move materials and semi-products. This process must be performed in a distributed, dynamic and autonomous way [3] . Moreover, AGV also have to communicate with the production stands, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and other AGV. For this reason, the machine learning approach has to be combined with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. This requires, on the one hand, adjusting the information that is collected from the production systems into a form that is suitable for automatic processing, which can be performed by using artificial intelligence algorithms. The results that are produced by these algorithms have to be converted into a form that can be exchanged with and used by the production systems [4] . In turn, the precise information that is owned by AGV includes important parameters about the materials, semi-finished products and finished products that are being transported. Such data can be beneficial for the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and for the Business Intelligence (BI) solutions that support the long-term optimisation of the production processes.",

Cooperative-based internal logistics permits increased production flexibility. Because AGV are in the executive part of the internal logistics, their cooperation with other information systems and manufacturing equipment is particularly important. AGV have become a critical enabling technology for agile production systems. Modern production systems are characterised by a demand for a high degree of flexibility in order to cope with the frequent changes that result from orders that are changed by customers, low material buffers, the agile production technologies that are performed by robotised production stations and the many variants of production technology that can be used [1] . All of the factors mentioned above require the production process to be supported online by highly advanced information services, which are tasks must be performed in a distributed, dynamic and autonomous way. AGV are key components that are necessary for developing flexible and efficient internal transport systems [6] .",

Introducing safe, collaborative robots [7] into production systems (that also work together with human operators) opens up the possibility of using robots for a wider variety of tasks and permits the physical barriers to the rest of the production processes to be removed. Such an option enables robot automation to be introduced more widely into factoriesbut these robots are still usually dedicated to specific assembly stations. Combining collaborative robots [8, 9] with AGV ( Fig. 1 ) merges the dynamic logistic benefits of AGV with the flexibility of collaborative robots to enable a more extensive use between many assembly stations. This could also increase the efficiency of the production staff. However, the autonomous operation of AGV requires that several issues have to be resolved. The integration of an AGV, a collaborative robot and various sensors requires that data fusion methods [10] be used to achieve a docking functionality and to recalibrate the AGV and robot to that particular assembly station.",

Using distance sensors enables the docking precision to be increased. To determine the accuracy of the measurements [16, 17] , the selected sensors must be tested (camera, lidar, gyroscope, accelerometer, optical encoders). A vision-based recognition system further confirms that an AGV has arrived at the correct production station.

Using recognition methods based on a vision system increases the precision of the measurements. This approach allows the information covered by distance sensors to be combined with the vision system [18] to develop an algorithm that increases the accuracy of the distance measurements. The algorithms that are obtained allow the robot's displacement regarding the reference coordinate system at the mounting place at the assembly station to be calculated. In addition, robot-based calibration can be used to set the reference points for each axis. The displacement of the robot arm to the reference points at the assembly station and the use of precise force measurement on selected axes enables a more accurate determination of the current position of a collaborative robot.",

One of the major challenges with physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is how to handle the possible or perceived risk of human-robot collisions [8] . Human motion and intention estimates that based on sensors [9] can ensure that the human states are continuously monitored and the human motion data together with the force/torque (FT) measurements from a collaborative robot can serve as inputs to a collision-handling (CH) system. A CH system can continuously monitor and assess the risk of unwanted interactions and collisions and implement the necessary reaction mechanisms, e.g. lower the speed of the robot, switch to a gravity compensation and compliance mode or to adhere to an admittance reflex strategy to drive away from the unwanted contact force [8] . A CH system should be implemented at the lowest control level in order to ensure that handling collisions takes priority over task execution. A collaborative robot control scheme for pHRI for robots that are mounted on AGV allows an overall system architecture to be built that takes into account the changes in roles between a human and robot in the interaction (leaderfollower, collaboration) [21, 22] and how to dynamically share the tasks in any humanrobot cooperative load transport [23] . The overall system architecture should also allow the seamless, shared cooperative pHRI control for a wide range of possible applications.",

They are primarily focused on two aspects of pHRIadaptive impedance control, and learning the desired trajectories [8] . Adaptive impedance controllers are focused on learning or adapting to the impedance gains and feedforward torques of the controller to improve the robot capabilities during an interaction. Some recent results have used neural networks or biomimetic approaches to learning [25] . Learning the desired trajectories for a pHRI has, in recent years, been primarily focused on using hidden Markov models (HMM) to find the appropriate motion patterns for human-robot cooperation. A novel approach for a mobile bi-manual platform is taken in [26] , where semantic task structures are learned during a joint task execution and where the semantic labels on the task segments are given by the human partner using speech recognition.",

The Administration Shell can allow access for both the fundamental elements of the system and for the highly complex aggregates that consist of many components. In the case of AGV, we can indicate two levels for the application of the Administration Shellone for a single vehicle that is responsible for executing the transportation tasks and the second for a fleet of AGV that offers holistic transportation services. Moreover, for each level, the information model must be presented according to its context of use, which means that multiple Administration Shells have to be implemented on each aggregation level. The Administration Shell should be implemented by communication middleware such as OPC UA. The OPC UA is an object-based and service-oriented communication middleware that not only supports the exchange of information but also organises the information models [35] . It is based on the client-server communication principle. Secure communication uses a Secure Channel.

Such an approach has resulted in several domain-specific information models that have been created under OPC UA, which are dedicated to a given type of application. In the context of AGV, two such models seem to be particularly valuable -(1) the OPC Foundation and AutomationML Companion Specification \"AutomationML for OPC UA\" [36] , which can be used for a technical description of an AGV and its components and (2) \"OPC UA for ISA-95 Common Object Model\" [37] , which is more relevant for communication with an MES. The address space of the OPC UA server can be browsed by any OPC UA clients that are connected. A reference mechanism is used to express the dependencies between the parts of the model. References link OPC objects with their type definition, other objects and the variables that are responsible for the physical data representation. The data types define the interpretation of the values of variables, which are also connected by references. The types of all of the references are known to clients and therefore the kind of relationship between the connected nodes can be easily determined. The number of [34] references between two particular nodes is not limited, so different dependencies can be expressed in one model. Clients can use the browsing services to discover all of the data items and model-based types of information about the items that are managed by the OPC UA server.",

Each OPC UA client defines a set of subscriptions for the selected OPC UA servers, which are then performed as parts of individual sessions. The number of Monitored Items for each subscription is agreed upon between the client and the server. These mechanisms enable clients to select the required data. In this model, a client subscribes to variables with a given Sampling Interval [ms] according to which the OPC UA server only sends new information to the client when there is a change in the source of information, which is checked cyclically with the frequency that is defined by the sampling interval.

Because OPC UA is only a communication interface, the historical data should be stored in an external database. Both Data Access and Historical Access communication modes use a common memory model. Each client can freely select the information in the server's address space and request access to the data under the requirements that they have defined. A common memory model does not support the integrity of the information between clients.

WSAN consist of interconnected sensors and actuators that collaborate in order to monitor and control a system. The sensors measure the physical quantities and report this to the actuators, which then act on them. Currently, WSAN design generally uses a sink to collect and process the collected data and to send commands to the actuators. A WSAN handles network functions such as routing and scheduling medium access. The increased application of WSAN wireless technologies in industry has given rise to a plethora of protocol designs [39] . However, due to the added delay as the data transmits through the sink, future network design will include peer-to-peer communication between the sensor nodes and actuator nodes. This will be discussed further below.",

Current industrial sensor networks (that also include WSAN) face a challenge due to the limited interoperability between different systems. One option is to relay the sensor data (using a sink solution) between the stovepipe solutions. Three challenges emerge. First, since the two solutions are disjoint and both offer a similar functionality, there is a duplication of functionality. In addition to the added cost, this solution also adds a delay as the data must be relayed through interconnection points. The relay point is located on the edge of the network, thus creating an excessive delay compared to a peer-to-peer connection. Second, the main challenge facing the network designer is ensuring the predictable maximum delay end-to-end. Interconnecting two disjoint technologies in which each separate network segment operates independently from each other obstructs such guarantees. Furthermore, since each stovepipe solution resides in disjoint domains and operates in isolation, it is not possible to establish an optimal path. Third, each separate network segment (stovepipe) has its own management system, which means that no coherent management can be developed. The only viable solution is to transform the current disjoint technologies into a common infrastructure similar to the transformation that occurred in the telecom industry in the 1990s.",

Transmitting data through a sink delays the data too much. In addition, this solution makes the autonomous unit dependent on the infrastructure. Communication between an autonomous unit and fixed infrastructure requires special attention because the units detach from an access point (or base station) and re-attach to a new location (or station). Layer 3 technologies (IP) offer solutions for moving units, but further investigations/research is required to understand its implications on the delay as well as its robustness. Moreover, security will be an issue as both the de-detachment and re-attachment of the unit must follow strict security procedures. These procedures are likely to add a delay.",

These analytics cover the development and use of ML algorithms to analyse the behaviour of AGV and to detect any anomalies, possible problems or failures. Machine learning provides many algorithms that fall into two main classes: (i) supervisedwhere information on the occurrence of faults is present in the training data set and (ii) unsupervisedwhere the process information is available, but no maintenance-related data exists. The supervised approaches [41] are divided into (i) classification modelsif the categorical labels are predicted and (ii) regression modelsif the results are continuous values. Classification and regression may need to be preceded by a relevance analysis, which attempts to identify the attributes that are significantly relevant to the classification and regression processes [42] . Supervised learning is successfully used in the area of predictive maintenance to classify faults by building fault detectors. In the literature, these detectors rely on various AI techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks [43] , k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines [44] , Bayesian networks [45] or Principle Component Analysis [46] . Unsupervised learning techniques primarily work based on algorithms that detect outliers. Outliers can be detected using statistical tests that assume a distribution or probability model for the data or by using distance measures in which objects that are remote from any other cluster are considered to be outliers. Building models that do not require labelled data is possible because of techniques such as auto-encoders, Deep Belief Networks or statistical analysis [47] .",
