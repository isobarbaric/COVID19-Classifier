Therefore, a computational survey was carried out for the Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genome with the open reading frames from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Seventeen functional sequences were used to analyze promoter regions and their regulatory elements. Result: The present study revealed that 94% of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes contained more than two TSSs. Among these identified TSSs, a TSS with the highest predictive score was considered to determine a promoter region of the genes. Moreover, a total of five common candidate motifs such as MotI, MotII, MotIII, MotIV, and MotV were identified. Among these motifs, motif IV was investigated as the common promoter motif for 41.17% of genes that serve as binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) involved in the expression regulation of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes. Motif IV was also compared to registered motifs in publically available databases to see if they are similar to known regulatory motifs for TF using TOMTOM web server. Hence, it was revealed that MotIV might serve as the binding site mainly for the leucine zipper TF gene family to regulate a gene expression of Trametes hirsuta strain 072. Regarding CpG island determination, it was concluded that there is no CpG island in both promoter and gene body regions of the Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genome."

            "text": "A functional genome sequence of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 was taken from the NCBI genome browser (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene). A total of seventeen gene coding sequences starting with the ATG codon were identified and used in this analysis. To determine their respective transcription start sites (TSSs), 1-kb sequences upstream of the start codon were excised from each gene [32] . All the TSSs of each functional gene were searched within this region by using a Neural Network Promoter Prediction (NNPP version 2.2) toolset with the minimum standard predictive score (between 0 and 1) cutoff value of 0.8 [33] . This tool helps locate the possible TSSs within the sequences upstream of the start codon where the RNA polymerases start their activity and transcription process. The Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool has the ability to recognize precisely the position of a TSS for a given gene. For those regions containing more than one TSS, the highest value of the prediction score was considered to be a trustable and accurate prediction. According to a previously reported study, a promoter sequence was defined as a 1-kb region upstream of each TSS [34, 35] ."

Similarly, a second approach to explore the presence of CpG islands in silico digestion was performed using the restriction enzyme MspI, which revealed poor CpG islands in both promoter and gene body regions (Table 5 ). CpG islands from only the atp8 gene contained a single fragment size of 141 bp in its promoter region. However, there were no CpG island-specific sequences in the other ten promoter sequences of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes. Moreover, CpG islands were only recognized in the Cox1 gene with a fragment size of 17bp and 114bp (Table 5) , which is poor CpG islands in this species."

Loewen et al. [44] stated that transcriptional repressor OPI1 had a transcription corepressor activity as molecular functions. CpG islands were also investigated to determine regulatory elements in the Trametes hirsuta in both promoter and gene body regions using two algorithms. Initially, in silico analysis using Takai and Jones' algorithm [39] found no CpG islands in promoter regions in Trametes hirsuta strain 072 (Table 4 ). This result is inconsistent with the study conducted by Yirgu and Kebede [34] , which revealed there was one possible CpG island in most of the genes both in promoter and gene body regions. Moreover, this study is consistent with studies that reported poor CpG islands in both promoter and gene body regions [26, 42, 45] . Similarly, a second approach to explore the presence of CpG island in silico digestion was performed using restriction enzyme MspI, which revealed poor CpG islands in both promoter and gene body regions (Table 5 ). CpG islands from only the atp8 gene contain a single fragment size of 141 bp in its promoter region. However, there were no CpG islandspecific sequences in the other ten promoter sequences of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes. Moreover, CpG islands were only recognized in the Cox1 gene with a fragment size of 17 bp and 114 bp (Table 5 ) and concluded as poor in CpG islands in this species. Consequently, the present result disagreed with the study of Yirgu and Kebede [34] , which concluded that H. seropedicae ACP92 genes were rich in CpG islands and were consistent with the studies of [26, 42, 45] summarized as poor in CpG islands in different eukaryotic organisms."

This study revealed that 94% of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes contained more than two TSSs. Therefore, among identified TSSs, a TSS with the highest predictive score was considered to determine the genes' promoter regions. Moreover, five common candidate motifs such as MotI, MotII, MotIII, MotIV, and MotV were identified. Among these motifs, motif IV was investigated as the common promoter motif for 41.17% of genes that serve as binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) involved in the gene expression and regulation mechanisms of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes."
