International and local travel restrictions and physical distancing resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has compromised the delivery of many existing programmes and challenged international partnerships working in maternal and newborn heath to adapt rapidly. In this paper, we share the experiences of a midwife-led research partnership between Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, UK, Zambia and Zimbabwe in sustaining and enhancing capacity strengthening activities remotely in this period. Whilst considerable challenges arose, and not all were overcome, collectively we gained new insights and important learning which have shifted perspectives and will impact future design and delivery of learning programmes.

Despite significant overall research investment, capacity strengthening which 'enhances the abilities of individuals, organisations and systems to undertake and disseminate high quality research efficiently and effectively' [2] has lagged behind other research activities in many LMICs [3] . Commonly, funding and leadership continue to be controlled from institutions based in high income countries (HICs), whose researchers are often characterised as 'parachuting' into LMICs to conduct research [4] . This 'neo-colonial' approach reinforces unequal power relations and hinders development of local infrastructure, support functions and governance structures needed for sustainable research programmes. Inequity is not the only issue, the domination of expertise and intellectual direction from HICs is also likely to negatively impact on research quality and future impact [5] . It is increasingly recognised that effective and appropriate solutions to complex health issues requires meaningful involvement of those living and working in local settings, with a nuanced understanding including barriers and facilitators of change.",

This was facilitated by a variety of contacts; regular country visits were made by the Africa co-ordinator (SW) and UK team, and whole group start-up and annual meetings included training workshops and development reviews. Inperson delivery facilitated high degrees of interactivity which was considered essential for the focus on practical and skills-based content.

Fortunately, most project-specific training for year three had already been completed at this stage, but potential for increased 'downtime' due to reduced activity was identified, particularly for research assistants J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f employed full-time on the programme. Both UK and country leads were eager to capitalise on the COVID-19 interruption as an opportunity to provide additional training and development sessions. In addition to maintaining momentum in skills development, online contacts were perceived to support relationships and networks amongst the research team, built during the previous 30 months.

Lack of non-verbal feedback, cues and communication delays have been identified as significant challenges for both facilitators and participants in establishing effective relationships in virtual environments [12, 13] . Therefore, participants were encouraged to keep webcams on for introductions, and question and answers. The 'chat' function was highlighted at the start of each session and participants encouraged to post questions and feedback. Most participants joined individually from home or their workplace, but where restrictions allowed others chose to attend in small groups. As research group members, all participants had access to programme laptops, but connectivity issues frequently arose, especially for those joining from remote areas or home.",

Despite efforts to foster an interactive approach, some participants still expressed lack of 'connectedness' and facilitators reported negative impacts of lack of visual cues and feedback. Use of the 'chat' function and question and answer sessions addressed this to some extent, use of webcams during sessions was encouraged but was not always possible due to poor internet connections. Some participants attended webinars in groups, where this was permitted, this allowed sharing experiences and small group discussion more effectively. Recent studies have identified the lack of emotional connection between providers and learners, often facilitated by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f subtle non-verbal cues including facial expression and gestures, as a barrier to learning in online environments [15] . Phirangee and Hewitt (2016) observed students increasingly using emoticons, punctuation (particularly exclamation marks) and the 'Like' button, originally developed in social media but incorporated into videoconferencing and communication platforms including Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet to enable reactions during educational activities [16] . These low effort non-verbal supports were perceived to support active expression and engagement and increase feelings of security. Participants in our sessions did not use these extensively, signposting and role modelling by the facilitator could increase awareness and provide an alternative means of communication, which does not interrupt the flow of activities. Careful planning and delivery can, to some extent, mitigate lack of contact during online sessions. However, it is recognised that much benefit from educational activities is also gained from informal and ad hoc contacts with colleagues and facilitators which are difficult to replicate in a virtual environment [17] . Internet quality and availability were also a major issue for some participants, particularly those based in rural areas. The cost of connection using mobile internet was not anticipated as an issue, fortunately funds were available to reimburse research staff for expenses, but accurate costing to support access will be an important consideration for future programmes.",

Some group members preferred this virtual delivery and increased use of this mode also made the entire programme accessible to more participants across the group and allowed inclusion of external participants. The remote programme J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f also perceptibly increased south to south networking amongst research assistants, stemming from strengthened connections via the WhatsApp group. The transfers of international conferences online, with reduced or free access also increased participation, especially for junior researchers who might lack resources for travel needed to attend in person. Although positive impacts are acknowledged, the wider health and social impacts of the sudden move to home or remote working, including training, are not fully understood. Home working is associated with variable mental and physical health outcomes and there is also emerging evidence that exacerbation of existing social inequities may result, for example where inadequate space, equipment or internet access prevent effective engagement and interaction [18] . Gender roles may also impact on ability and quality of engagement especially where training is accessed from home. Whilst flexibility might present some advantages, women who are home working more often report the lack of physical distance impacts on balancing work with domestic responsibilities, leading to increased stress and exhaustion [19] .",

The most common issues identified for improvement related to technology and connections, many participants experienced difficulties with joining or remaining connected to sessions. An issue not fully anticipated by the UK team was the cost and stability of mobile internet connections, participants often had to connect via mobile dongle when they were unable to access workplace internet connections during lockdown.' internet connectivity is expensive, especially mobile data bundles when working from home, if the countries could support RAs on purchasing this would be very helpful. (Participant 13) 'Most Sessions were characterised by poor connectivity. Zoom was not effective in providing the best platform to facilitate proper learning. There were times when we had interruptions during sessions. I think that the organisers should use other platforms in future sessions.' (Participant 1) A 'WhatsApp' group was set up, initially to discuss follow up tasks arising from the research. However, research assistants subsequently continued, interacting frequently with their colleagues in other countries around COVID-19 impacts locally and supporting each other around issues arising in their work. Many attended external events, with several research assistants presenting posters at the GLOW 2020 online conference. In addition to their contributions in leading many of the webinars, country research leads joined many of the sessions providing support and encouragement to junior staff. We did not specifically evaluate the programme with this group, however the success of the main programme led to requests for additional development for leads, particularly around research leadership issues, development of funding applications and media training. In response, the UK team developed a parallel series of sessions specifically focusing on supporting research proposal development for leads and early career researchers. Four sessions including research planning and finance, building a research team, capacity strengthening, patient and public involvement and impact were held at monthly intervals during July and August 2021. provided a unique challenge to progress in strengthening midwifery and nursing research capabilities across the partnership in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and UK. Ensuring programme aims could be met during this unexpected and unprecedented crisis required adaptability, flexibility and creativity from all facilitators and participants. Most importantly, we relied on participants continual willingness and commitment to engage, despite various difficulties, not all of which were completely resolved during the programme. This co-operation and shared vision was crucial in sustaining and extending the development and training activities during this period and ultimately supporting the successful delivery of the NIHR Global Health Group Stillbirth research, which was completed as planned.",
