The World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out the various problems caused by the continued increase in the global prevalence of obesity [2] . In many parts of the world, obesity is a more serious health issue than malnutrition [1, 2] . According to previous studies, obesity is a risk factor for many acute and chronic health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [1] [2] [3] . Furthermore, it has been reported that obesity is associated with immune vulnerability [4] . A recent meta-analysis study suggested that obese individuals tend to have a higher mortality rate from the COVID-19 pandemic than those who do not [5] . According to the WHO, \"at least 2.8 million people die each year worldwide as a result of being overweight or obese, and an estimated 35.8 million of global disability-adjusted life years are caused by overweightness or obesity\" [2] . Obesity is thus considered a metabolic disease and \"a gateway to not only ill health but also elevation of morbidity, mortality, and chronic complications\" [2, [6] [7] [8] . In addition to the medical burdens, obesity has led to financial burdens worldwide [2, [9] [10] [11] . One previous study has estimated that \"obesity-related medical costs will increase by $48-66 billion/year in the USA and by \u00a31.9-2 billion/year in the UK by 2030\" [9] . In South Korea, socioeconomic losses due to obesity amounted to USD 10.3 billion in 2016, which is a 1.6-fold increase over the past three years [10] .",

In addition to medicines, obesity control strategies depend primarily on a healthy lifestyle that incorporates adequate physical activity and food intake to maintain energy balance [16] . In recent years, access to complementary and alternative medicines for obesity management has increased significantly [15] . Many obese individuals may prefer and actively adopt complementary or alternative health approaches and nonpharmacological treatment options for weight management, despite remarkable weight control-related advances in conventional medicine [1, 3, 6, 17] . According to a 2012 national survey in the United States, more than 30% of American adults used complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches including, \"natural products, mind and body practices, and other methods to manage their weight\" [17] . A 2014 survey in Jordan found that approximately 40% of women aged 18 years or older used some form of complementary and alternative medicine for weight control [6] . Australian researchers have reported that three-quarters of a group of breast cancer survivors had used complementary therapies for weight loss [18] . Excluding these previous studies, few have published national survey data on CIH approaches used in weight control.",

This is similar to widely documented increases noted worldwide over this period [1, 2, 9] . These observations support warnings that global obesity rates are at epidemic levels, and Korean rates clearly indicate a national health problem [22] . In this study, the prevalence of obesity was identified as meaningful results based on demographic variables such as sex, age, marital status, economic activity status, family income level, and education level. This study found a higher prevalence of obesity among men than among women, similar to reports from the WHO [2]. In contrast, surveys have revealed that obesity is generally higher among women in the United States [23] . Interestingly, in this study, the obesity prevalence was highest in 40-to 49-year-old men, following which it tended to gradually decrease. However, the obesity prevalence was highest among women over 70 years of age and showed a tendency to increase with age. The obesity prevalence among Korean adults was found to be higher among those who were married and economically active than those who were not. This suggests that additional research is needed to determine the causative association between weight gain and marriage among Korean men. The obesity prevalence tends to be higher for men with higher family income levels and women with lower income levels. This is believed to stem from the culture that Korean women may be more conscious regarding esthetics than men. This also reflects the need to investigate the effect of the gender income gap on the prevalence of obesity. In addition, there was a difference in the prevalence of obesity between men and women based on the level of education. It was most prevalent in men with a college degree or higher and in women after graduation from primary school. These results emphasize that effective measures to combat obesity must be tailored to fit the needs and preferences of different demographic groups. Furthermore, these findings reflect the need for in-depth additional studies to investigate the differences in obesity prevalence based on demographic characteristics in Korean adults. Nevertheless, these results are expected to be used as basic data for evidence-based obesity management.",

The current findings differ from reports on Jordanian women with obesity, who had preferences for commercial dietary supplements, herbal products including green tea, and folk remedies [6] . In another previous study, the most popular complementary therapies for weight loss were \"dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbs, and antioxidants), yoga, relaxation techniques, massage, and meditation\" [18] . The reasons for differing preferences between countries for weight-control approaches likely include cultural eating patterns and irregular daily life habits [26] . There was an age-related difference in the preference for the CIH approach among obese Korean women. The access rate for decreased food intake was the highest, observed in the group of women aged 40 to 49. The group over 70 years of age, with the highest prevalence of obesity, showed a high reduction in food intake volume, a high preference for exercise, and no fasting at all. In particular, among 30-to 39-year-old women, skipping meals and herbal medicines were the preferred choice of obesity management, compared to other age groups. Exercise was also the most preferred approach for obesity management among 50 to 59-year-old women, compared to other age groups. Married women showed a higher rate of access to CIH than unmarried women, and there was no significant difference in access depending on whether they were economically active. Interestingly, in the group of women with the highest family income, the decrease in food intake volume was the least, while the herbal medicine approach rate was the highest. This may be attributed to the high-cost herbal medicine in Korea being highly preferred as a popular diet approach for obese women who are economically wealthy. Among women who graduated from college or higher, the preference for various CIH approaches except exercise was lower than that of other educational groups. This is consistent with the highest prevalence of obesity among women who graduated from primary school or younger. These data can be used as the basis for developing interventions for evidence-based obesity management. From the results of this study, it was confirmed that the preference of the CIH approach for obesity management in the Korean obese population differs based on demographic characteristics. However, research to confirm the degree of effectiveness of the CIH approaches used by the Korean obese population for obesity management should be continued. These results may aid in the reestablishment of the government's obesity management policy and initiation of its dissemination along with the development of evidence-based interventions.",

For this reason, the present study has limitations, in that it is difficult to compare the weight management methods of the obese population in Korea with CIH approaches for weight management of the obese population applied in other countries. Another limitation of this study is the structure of questions in the KNHANES. In particular, the response of \"exercise\" included fitness, yoga, biking, and other physical activities. Future investigations should measure this in more detail by subdividing the \"exercise\" item into individual items.",

In addition, this information, particularly about differences according to demographic variables such as sex, age, marital status, economic activity status, family income level, and education level, could be useful in assessing the efficacy of specific approaches. The results could be used in follow-up studies to confirm the progress of weight management in these study participants. Finally, the KNHANES data are sufficiently rigorous to enable comparisons across countries and to be used for health policy development. If the sharing of data on obesity management accumulated in various countries is activated, this could aid the derivation, application, feedback, and improvement of global obesity management policies. CIH approaches for weight control must be continuously developed with consideration of \"social, cultural, behavioral, and environmental contexts\" in the future [36] . Furthermore, evidence-based CIH approaches for individuals with obesity should be continuously tested using rigorous randomized controlled trials [1, 13, 36] . Above all, based on reliable and representative national survey data and evidence-based strategies, measures for individuals with obesity should be developed and shared, such that they can be implemented in different countries and population groups globally.",

Overall, exercise (including fitness, yoga, biking, and other physical activities) was the most common approach used for weight management. The use of the approach differed according to demographic variables such as sex, age, marital status, economic activity status, family income level, and education level. In particular, regarding sex-related differences, men preferred to exercise, while women were more likely to decrease food intake. These findings indicate that it is necessary to individualize weight management approaches and measures according to the targeted demographic characteristics in adults with obesity. Further investigations are needed to verify the efficacy of CIH approaches used by the Korean obese population. Furthermore, these findings could be used as basic data to compare weight management before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
