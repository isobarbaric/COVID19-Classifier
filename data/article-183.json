            "text": "Limited information is available on the decay rate of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA in wastewater and primary settled solids, potentially limiting an understanding of how transit or holding times within wastewater infrastructure might impact RNA measurements and their relationship to community COVID-19 infections. In this study, primary settled solids samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Samples were thoroughly mixed, aliquoted into subsamples, and stored at 4, 22, and 37\u00b0C for 10 days. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 targets) and PMMoV RNA were measured using an RT-ddPCR. Limited decay (<1 log 10 reduction) was observed in the detection of viral RNA targets at all temperature conditions, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA can be highly persistent in solids. First-order decay rate constants ranged from 0.011 to 0.098 day \u22121 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and from 0.010 to 0.091 day \u22121 for PMMoV RNA depending on the temperature conditions. A slower decay was observed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in primary settled solids compared to previously reported decay in wastewater influent. Further research is needed to understand if solid content and wastewater characteristics might influence the persistence of viral RNA targets."

Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 incidence may be considerably smaller than actual COVID-19 incidence owing to test-seeking behaviors which are influenced by testing availability and symptom presence and severity. 8, 9 Some studies aim to infer actual COVID-19 incident cases from wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using models. 10\u221212 Such models require the input of various parameters including fecal loads, viral shedding rates, flow to the wastewater treatment plant, the decay rate constant and partition coefficient of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the average residence time of wastewater prior to sample collection. In some models, PMMoV RNA is used as an endogenous viral process control and as a fecal strength control. 5 The accuracy of these models is still uncertain, and further research is still needed to improve them. Understanding the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA is critical in their implementation."

In addition, most of these studies do not measure the decay of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 RNA; rather, they seed the wastewater with an exogenous virus. A recent study by Chick et al. 18 found that surrogate spikes of SARS-CoV-2 (in this case gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2) may exhibit different solid\u2212liquid partitioning behaviors compared to SARS-CoV-2 naturally found in wastewater.

Normalizing by PMMoV theoretically controls for fluctuations in population contributing to a given wastewater sample; however, it may also correct for variation in RNA recoveries between samples 5 and for losses of RNA during storage. 16, 20 PMMoV is a nonenveloped single-strand RNA virus highly abundant in human feces and wastewater. 21, 22 Studies have shown that PMMoV RNA is remarkably stable in wastewater and exhibits almost no seasonal variation. 23 Rachmadi et al. 24 studied the persistence of endogenous PMMoV RNA using RT-qPCR in constructed wetlands and found limited decay at three temperatures (4, 22, and 37\u00b0C) for 21 days, suggesting it is highly persistent. Given that PMMoV RNA concentrations are used in wastewater monitoring programs to normalize SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, studying its persistence relative to SARS-CoV-2 targets is important. To date, no study has measured the persistence of PMMoV RNA in wastewater or primary settled solids."

Samples from each POTW were thoroughly mixed and aliquoted into 50 mL conical tubes for a total of 32 subsamples per POTW and 6 time points; 2 subsamples were sacrificed at each time point. Subsamples were then placed inside opaque boxes (to shield samples from light) and placed into constant-temperature rooms at 4, 22, and 37\u00b0C. Two subsamples were processed immediately to determine the initial concentrations of PMMoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA at time zero (t = 0). Another subsample was reserved for percent solids analysis which required heating the sample at 105\u00b0C for 24 h and comparing the weight before and after drying. Table S3 includes the percent of solids measured in primary settled solid samples collected from each POTW. On days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, subsamples were retrieved from each temperature condition. Each 50 mL conical tube was centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was decanted, and about 0.225 g of solids was aliquoted into 15 mL conical tubes. The supernatant was assumed to contain a small fraction of the RNA targets 1,2,6 as they have been shown to be highly concentrated in the solid fraction (1000 times), and the focus of our work is the solid matrix. Solids were immediately resuspended with 3 mL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research; cat. no. R1100-250) to prevent further degradation and preserve the genetic integrity of the subsamples. The final concentration of dewatered solids resuspended in spiked DNA/RNA Shield was approximately 75 mg/mL. This concentration of solids was chosen as it was found to alleviate inhibition in the downstream RT-ddPCR. 25 All subsamples were spiked with 4.5 \u03bcL of bovine coronavirus vaccine (Zoetis; #CALF-GUARD) to estimate viral RNA extraction efficiencies. RNA extracts needed to have at least a 10% recovery efficiency to be included in the analysis; otherwise, they were excluded from the data analysis. Note that there is no agreed-upon cutoff in the field for recovery of exogenous controls, but given the complexities of identifying and interpreting results from such controls, 26 we feel this is a reasonable cutoff."

Dimensional and statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and Rstudio (version 4.1.2). First-order decay constants (k) were calculated for the experiments at each temperature and POTW using the average concentration of SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA at each time point (days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). The average concentration of RNA was calculated at each time point based on two subsamples (replicates); k and its standard error were determined using the function \"lm\" in Rstudio. k and the time needed to achieve a 90% reduction in concentration (T 90 ) were calculated using the following equations where C t is the concentration of the viral RNA at time t, C 0 is the concentration of viral RNA at time zero, and k is the firstorder decay constant. k was calculated as the slope of ln(C t / C 0 ) over time using a linear least-squares regression model in R. Goodness of fit of the linear regression model was assessed by determining the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) and by visually inspecting the normality and homogeneity of variance of the residuals vs fitted values and Q\u2212Q plots. A Shapiro\u2212 Wilk test was also performed to assess the normality assumption."

The temperature and POTW were significant (p < 0.05) factors; therefore, the regression model was modified to only include these variables, and the interaction term (temperature \u00d7 POTW) was added to the model.

The slope of log 10 k versus temperature was similar for experiments conducted in primary settled solids (this study) and wastewater (0.0149 vs 0.0145). However, a lower y intercept was observed for primary settled solids compared to wastewater samples (\u22121.70 vs \u22120.83). log 10 k values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in primary settled solids have a positive correlation with temperature (r 2 = 0.49, p = 0.01). However, a poor fit was achieved for the linear regression model that regressed log 10 k values and temperature from various studies that used wastewater influent (r 2 = 0.07, p = 0.29)."

            "text": "\u25a0 DISCUSSION SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA can be highly persistent in primary settled solids. The persistence of viral RNA targets and infectious viruses can be influenced by the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of wastewater. These factors include temperature, pH, organic matter, dissolved oxygen, solid content, and microbial activity. 19, 30, 32 In this study, the decay rate constants of all RNA targets increased with temperature, which is consistent with previous studies of viral decay in the environment. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 24 Slightly larger decay rate constants were observed for RNA targets at POTW B compared to those at POTW A. The reason for this is unknown but could be due to the different chemical or physical characteristics of the wastewater matrix. It is also important to note that although there were differences in the decay rate constants between POTWs, the differences were small, and overall, the RNA targets were quite stable. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that influence the decay of these targets in the environment."

These RNA targets may be located on intact genomes inside of virus capsids and envelopes (for N1 and N2), fragmented genomes inside damaged capsids, or exterior to the virus capsid. Wurtzer et al. 33 showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can exist in diverse forms in wastewater, whereas Robinson et al. 34 indicated that SARS-CoV-2 targets are likely to be present within lipid envelopes in wastewater. Other studies have examined the persistence of viral RNA targets in the environment and generally found the RNA targets are more persistent than infectious viruses as measured using host cell lines. 14, 31 While RNA is generally believed to be quite labile, Walters et al. 35 showed that the RT-PCR target of naked enterovirus RNA was persistent in seawater microcosms and present for up to 15 days. Research is needed to better understand RNA persistence in the environment, especially as molecular biology methods for quantifying viral nucleic acids in the environment become more accessible and affordable for public health surveillance."

            "text": "It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has not been cultured from raw wastewater; 35 therefore, the scientific evidence to date indicates that detection of RNA in these samples is not associated with infectious viral particles. Moreover, the decay rate constants reported herein are not to be misinterpreted as decay rate constants for infectious SARS-CoV-2. Bivins et al. 14 measured decay rate constants of infectious SARS-CoV-2 seeded into wastewater and found T 90 = 1.6\u22122.1 days; they observed longer persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the same experiment, T 90 = 3.3\u221226.2 days. This is the first study that estimates the decay rate of PMMoV RNA in primary settled solids or any wastewaterrelated matrix. PMMoV is naturally found in human feces, wastewater, and primary settled samples, and previous studies have found that the molecular signal of PMMoV is remarkably temporally stable in wastewater with almost no seasonal variation throughout the year. 23 Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 RNA decay experiments in the literature have spiked wastewater samples with different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and in some instances inactivated the external source of SARS-CoV-2 using gamma radiation as a safety precaution. This was necessary to ensure a high initial concentration in wastewater samples, so that decay could be followed. Only one previous study 17 measured the decay rate of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, with T 90 values ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 days for wastewater influent samples stored at 4\u221235\u00b0C. These results are noticeably lower compared to previous experiments conducted using surrogate spikes of SARS-CoV-2 that reported T 90 values ranging from 3.4 to 52 days for samples stored at 4\u221237\u00b0C. Limited information is available on how the decay rate constants of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and spiked SARS-CoV-2 surrogates differ in wastewater and primary settled solid samples. Chik et al. 18 found that surrogate spikes of SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit different solid\u2212liquid partitioning behaviors compared to endogenous SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, spiking samples with an external source of SARS-CoV-2 may not necessarily represent natural conditions of SARS-CoV-2 present in wastewater and primary settled solids."

After concentrating and dewatering the subsamples, solids were immediately resuspended in DNA/RNA Shield and stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 5 days before extraction. Ideally, samples should be processed as soon as possible. However, the DNA/RNA Shield acts to preserve the integrity of the RNA in the solids and prevent its further degradation, and the results of this study suggest negligible decay of RNA targets at 4\u00b0C in the absence of the DNA/RNA Shield. Another possible constraint is that limited decay (<1 log 10 reduction) was observed in the detection of all RNA targets through this study. The length of the study was selected based on the average hydraulic residence time of the sewer network (<24 h) and the average residence time of solids in primary clarifiers (<12 h) in this study. Future studies could consider experimental durations."

            "text": "This study fills critical knowledge gaps regarding the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA in wastewater settled solids. We find that SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA can be highly persistent in primary settled solids for several weeks and even months depending on the temperature conditions. Results from this study and previous studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater suggest limited decay of viral nucleic acids during their transit through the sewer network and within the primary clarifiers as the time scales of transit in these systems are usually less than 48 h. This conclusion relies on the assumption that the persistence of the RNA targets in the solids obtained from the primary clarifier is similar to that of the RNA targets on solids suspended in wastewater as it transits through the sewage network. The k values reported herein will be particularly useful in models that link SARS-CoV-2 RNA in settled solids to COVID-19 incidence rates in sewersheds and aid in the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in settled solids for applications in wastewater-based epidemiology. Future experiments should investigate the decay of other targets used for wastewater-based epidemiology including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 36 \u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT"
