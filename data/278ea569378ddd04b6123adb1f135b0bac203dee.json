To attain process efficiencies, cost reductions, and improvement of the quality of diagnostic and imaging services, ISSSTE was set out in 2019 to create a digital filmless medical image and report management system. A large-scale clinical information system (CIS), including radiology information system (RIS), picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and clinical data warehouse (CDW) components, was implemented at ISSSTE's network of forty secondary-and tertiary-level public hospitals, applying global HL-7 and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standards. In just 5 months, 40 hospitals had their endoscopy, radiology, and pathology services functionally interconnected within a national CIS and RIS/PACS on secure private local area networks (LANs) and a secure national wide area network (WAN). More than 2 million yearly studies and reports are now in digital form in a CDW, securely stored and always available. Benefits include increased productivity, reduced turnaround times, reduced need for duplicate exams, and reduced costs. Functional IT solutions allow ISSSTE hospitals to leave behind the use of radiographic film and printed medical reports with important cost reductions, as well as social and environmental impacts, leading to direct improvement in the quality of health care services rendered.",

In terms of operating expense reduction, consumable supplies such as film plates, developing and fixer solutions, and film development equipment have been drastically reduced. Purchase and preventive/corrective maintenance of plate processors have also been minimized. Time optimization has been achieved by the avoidance of repeated image procedures. Internal evaluations conducted by ISSSTE have also documented that early diagnosis and timely treatment have led to reduced hospitalization days and reduced days of paid disability leaves to patients undergoing treatment [21] . From the clinical provider perspective, the viewing interfaces of the PACS system (TesiView) have enabled clinicians with the (previously nonexistent) possibility of processing images with viewing tools that are used to improve image resolution and visualization, which favors the identification of pathologies. This has also been related to a reduction in the number of studies and images taken per patient. Repeat studies have been reduced, and this means that the patient's exposure to ionizing radiation is also reduced, and time is Fig. 2 Known benefits of a CIS, CDW, RIS/PACS implementation [19] optimized, with a resulting increase in productivity and efficiency in the imaging departments [21] . Also, physical spaces that were used in hospitals for film development, storage of chemicals, and storage of printed film and files have been reassigned because there is less need for space and physical files have been replaced with digital ones. The quality and safety of the work carried out in diagnostic imaging departments have improved services provided to patients. The reported benefit of the CIS and CDW includes the availability of digital files for each patient, with secure and reliable information available by remote access. Physicians report more timely and accurate diagnoses, increasing the quality of medical care, in addition to facilitating the work of doctors. Dictation software and equipment, as well as reporting templates, have enabled radiologists to dictate studies that were previously typed, saving time. In a single work station, the radiologist can view all historical images and patient reports. Patient admissions are routinely handled through automated processes using databases and work lists, which has resulted in the avoidance of scheduling errors patients being \"lost.\" Diagnostic imaging reports can be viewed at any station or hospital computer, and it is no longer necessary to print reports, which has prevented them from getting lost or misplaced.",

Pathologists are now able to record the findings through dictation software and equipment, or manual transcription, using pre-coded standard phrases and checklists to facilitate the write-up of reports and associate them to ICD-10 coding. These improvements on the management in pathology departments have enabled epidemiologic analysis and the generation of productivity statistics related to TAT, epidemiologic and clinical outcomes, and diagnostic concordance analysis.
