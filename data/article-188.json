We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated."

Hypertension has been reported to be the most important comorbid condition with the potential to influence prognosis (21) (22) (23) . However, the actual contribution of HT to poor prognosis independent of its relation to age has not been convincingly demonstrated among COVID-19 (24) . Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in terms of frequency of HT among patients forming the family cluster and other COVID-19 patients in our study. The same trend was also observed when other comorbid conditions and smoking history of the family cluster were compared with other COVID-19 patients forming Group2 (Table 1) ."

Considering patients with definitive clinical outcome, Zhou et al. have demonstrated mild disease to be present in 38% of the general population and in 53% of the cases who have survived (21) . In our study, we have demonstrated the COVID-19 severity in patients forming the family cluster to be strikingly higher when compared to an unselected consecutive COVID-19 patient group who is age and sex matched and have a similar profile in terms of co-morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The same pattern was also recognized when chest CT findings of the family cluster were compared to other COVID-19 patients: all of the patients in the cluster had bilateral involvement whereas bilateral involvement was detected in only 63% of patients from Group2. More extensive disease involvement as detected by chest CT scans is recognized to be well correlated with both COVID-19 severity and worse disease prognosis (7, 26, 28) ."

All COVID-19 patients in Group1 have been hospitalized whereas only 32.7% of Group2 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized after their assessment in the ER (Table 3 ), in line with findings indicative of more severe disease in the family cluster. Moreover, length of hospital stays and need for transfer to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. Mortality was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients forming the family cluster; however, the difference was not statistically significant, possibly due to low number of deaths. In terms of COVID-19 treatment, no significant differences could be established between two groups, while it is worth mentioning that small number of patients and observational nature of the study should be taken into consideration and caution should be exercised before drawing conclusions regarding impact of therapy on prognosis (Table 3) . Nevertheless Jashua et al. have demonstrated that hydroxycholoroquine administration to the SARS-COV-2 positive population was associated with an increased need for escalation of respiratory support (29) . And since no difference with regard to hydroxycholoroquine use was demonstrated between family cluster patients and other COVID-19 cases, treatment alone seems to be not related to the differences in the clinical course, which in turn may be more related to the severity of COVID-19 in the family cluster."

In our study, a family meeting consisting of four cases has been identified as the main event leading to formation of the cluster. A three-person family cluster reported by Yousefzadegan et al. is interesting with regards to the observed poor outcome. They have reported three previously healthy brothers, \"without histories of underlying diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac or hepatic disease, or malignancy\", aged 54-66 years, who have died after less than 2 weeks of illness. The authors suggest that such cases may imply that there may be a particular predisposition which may render related people from same family susceptible to COVID-Accepted Article 19 and/or to severe illness from COVID-19 (15) . Interestingly, Shi et al., while trying to establish a host risk score for estimating susceptibility to severe COVID-19, have demonstrated that having more infected family members seems to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19, emerging as a risk factor which needs to be further investigated (14) ."

Difficulties in predicting clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 in daily practice may be interpreted as the presence of currently unforeseen host characteristics which make patients prone to untoward complications and unfavorable outcomes (14, 27) . Patients may have particular predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe illness, possibly variations in their immunological and inflammatory responses possibly mediated in at least in part by RAS system (15, 24, 34, 35) . A recent report has offered structural variations in human ACE2 influencing its binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a candidate for a mechanism by which host susceptibility to COVID-19 may be mediated (36)."

Since recognized COVID-19 prognostic factors like age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors and chronic co-morbid diseases seem to be unable to account for the differences in clinical presentation, this large family cluster may be an example of currently unrecognized host factors which may be important in determining susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as its prognosis. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. "
