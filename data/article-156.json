The reaction was quenched with water (0.5 mL) and diluted with 100 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 . The solution was passed through a short plug of silica gel and the organic material washed thoroughly with 30:1 CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated to yield a solid which was dissolved in distilled CH 2 Cl 2 (15 mL) and treated with Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) for 2 h at 25 o C. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient solvent elution of 25% acetone/CH 2 Cl 2 to 100% acetone. The fractions containing the product were combined and concentrated to give a white solid to which was added CHCl 3 (20 mL). After sitting for 10 min the mixture was filtered through a glass frit funnel (fine) and the filtrate was concentrated to provide aldehyde 2 (90% yield) as a white solid, mp 85 -88 o C. 2, 180.1, 173.2, 171.4, 156.4, 136.2, 134.1, 132.8, 132.3, 129.1, 128.8, 128.5, 128.2, 128.1, 127.9, 126.7, 126.0, 125.6, 123.8, 67.3, 57.8, 56.0, 52.0, 41.9, 40.8, 38.4, 35.4, 30.0, 28.7, 25 1, 180.2, 173.3, 171.3, 156.4, 136.5, 136.3, 129.6, 128.8, 128.7, 128.5, 128.2, 127.3, 67.4, 57.6, 56.3, 52.0, 42.0, 40.8, 38.3, 38.2, 30.0, 28.5, 25 . 4, 180.0, 173.3, 171.2, 156.4, 136.4, 134.1, 133.0, 132.4, 129.0, 128.8, 128.5, 128.4, 128.3, 128.0, 126.6, 126.0, 125.7, 124.0, 67.2, 58.3, 56.5, 51.8, 41.2, S-9 40. 8, 38.7, 35.6, 29.8, 28.9, 24.7, 23.1, 21.8 1, 180.1, 173.3, 171.2, 156.4, 136.2, 134.0, 133.6, 132.6, 128.8, 128.5, 128.45, 128.4, 128.2, 127.9, 127.6, 126.4, 126.0, 67.4, 58.0, 56.4, 52.1, 41.9, 40.8, 38.5, 38.4, 29.8, 28.8, 25.
