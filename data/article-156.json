To it, 10 \uf06dL of 0.07 M substrate (MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNa) was added, and the samples were monitored at \uf06c = 410 nm, T = 25\uf0b0C, for 120 seconds. for 30 minutes then 10 \uf06dL of 0.02 M substrate (N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNa) was added, and the samples were monitored at \uf06c = 410 nm, T = 25\uf0b0C for 120 seconds. The blank consisted of 980 \uf06dL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl/0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and 20 \uf06dL DMSO. The percent inhibition was calculated by taking the percent difference between the hydrolysis slope and the inhibition slope. DMF (10 mL). The solution was stirred at 25 o C and dry CH 2 Cl 2 (25 mL) was added, and the resulting solution was stirred for 18 h. The reaction was partitioned between water (150 mL) and CH 2 Cl 2 (150 mL). The pH of the aqueous layer was adjusted to 3 using 2 N HCl. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with CH 2 Cl 2 (150 mL each). The combined organic layers were dried (anhydrous MgSO 4 ), filtered and concentrated to yield a sticky solid which was purified by silica gel chromatography (30:1 CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH) to yield compound 11, 1.6 g (72% yield) as a white solid, mp 70 -73 o C. 1 H NMR \u03b4 7.84 (d, J = 7.03 Hz, 1H), 6.96 (br. s., 1H), 5.18 (d, J = 8.59 Hz, 1H), 1H), 1H) Hz, 3H, CH 3 ); 13 C NMR \u03b4 180.0, 173. 6, 172.5, 155.9, 80.0, 53.0, 52.6, 51.3, 42.5, 40.7, 38.5, 33.3, 28.5, 28.3, 24.8, 23.1, 22.4 ; MS, m/z 422.3 (M+Na) + .Procedure: Compound 11 (1 mmol) was dissolved in 10% TFA/CH 2 Cl 2 (5 mL) and stirred at 25 o C for 4 h. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a sticky oil that was redissolved in chloroform followed by removal of the solvent once again on the rotary evaporator to yield a semi-solid material. After sitting under high vacuum for 0.5 h, a white solid (the Boc S-5 group was removed) was obtained in quantitative yield. To this solid (1 mmol) was added (S)-N-Cbz-1-naphthylalanine (12b) (1 mmol), EDCI (2 mmol) and DMAP (2 mmol) followed by dry CH 2 Cl 2 (15 mL) and the resulting solution was stirred at 25 o C for 18 h under argon atmosphere.The reaction mixture was partitioned between water (150 mL) and CH 2 Cl 2 (150 mL), the aqueous layer was acidified to pH = 2 using 2 N HCl, and extracted three times with CH 2 Cl 2 (150 mL each).

The reaction was quenched with water (0.5 mL) and diluted with 100 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 . The solution was passed through a short plug of silica gel and the organic material washed thoroughly with 30:1 CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated to yield a solid which was dissolved in distilled CH 2 Cl 2 (15 mL) and treated with Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) for 2 h at 25 o C. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient solvent elution of 25% acetone/CH 2 Cl 2 to 100% acetone. The fractions containing the product were combined and concentrated to give a white solid to which was added CHCl 3 (20 mL). After sitting for 10 min the mixture was filtered through a glass frit funnel (fine) and the filtrate was concentrated to provide aldehyde 2 (90% yield) as a white solid, mp 85 -88 o C. 2, 180.1, 173.2, 171.4, 156.4, 136.2, 134.1, 132.8, 132.3, 129.1, 128.8, 128.5, 128.2, 128.1, 127.9, 126.7, 126.0, 125.6, 123.8, 67.3, 57.8, 56.0, 52.0, 41.9, 40.8, 38.4, 35.4, 30.0, 28.7, 25 1, 180.2, 173.3, 171.3, 156.4, 136.5, 136.3, 129.6, 128.8, 128.7, 128.5, 128.2, 127.3, 67.4, 57.6, 56.3, 52.0, 42.0, 40.8, 38.3, 38.2, 30.0, 28.5, 25 . 4, 180.0, 173.3, 171.2, 156.4, 136.4, 134.1, 133.0, 132.4, 129.0, 128.8, 128.5, 128.4, 128.3, 128.0, 126.6, 126.0, 125.7, 124.0, 67.2, 58.3, 56.5, 51.8, 41.2, S-9 40. 8, 38.7, 35.6, 29.8, 28.9, 24.7, 23.1, 21.8 1, 180.1, 173.3, 171.2, 156.4, 136.2, 134.0, 133.6, 132.6, 128.8, 128.5, 128.45, 128.4, 128.2, 127.9, 127.6, 126.4, 126.0, 67.4, 58.0, 56.4, 52.1, 41.9, 40.8, 38.5, 38.4, 29.8, 28.8, 25. ethylcarbamoyl]-butylcarbamoyl}-ethyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (5) .
