Forty-four patients were hospitalized for various respiratory manifestations; all of them have benefited from a respiratory sample during acute symptoms. Among the 44 patients, FA detected 23 positive samples including 31 viruses, 26 of them gave high or moderate R-GENE\u00ae scores (cycle threshold < 35), and all but one were consistent with clinical history. Semi-quantitative scores would have allowed for critical interpretation of the results; those are a key additional element for an optimal exploitation of the rapid multiplex PCR assays power.",

As the number of RMPA tests available in the laboratory was limited for this period, this work is a pilot study, in preparation for a larger and prospective study. Respiratory samples had been collected using either a nasopharyngeal (NP) flocked swab placed in universal transport medium (FLOQSwabs\u2122, Copan, Brescia, Italy), NP aspiration, or bronchoalveolar lavage (Table 1 ) and were tested by viral and/or bacterial screening with RMPA FA and eP.

The viral loads of these targets could be at the limit of sensitivity of the assays. The possibility of false positive results with FA related to contamination should also be considered. In multiple virus detection discrepancies, most of the discordant targets had a moderate or even a high signal, which suggests that eP might not correctly detect some viruses, particularly some coronaviruses or rhinovirus/enteroviruses, as was previously reported [3] . Diagnoses of clinicians, who had the FA results, showed that they always considered the detected viruses to be the cause of acute respiratory issues or organ failure ( Table 2) . Among the 23 virus infected patients, 16 (69.9%) had respiratory symptoms related to an isolated viral infection ( Table 1 ). The median length of hospital stay after the RMPA result (Table 1) was not significantly shorter for the patients who were positive for at least one virus than for negative patients (1 day [1-6] versus 7 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , p = 0.082). Interestingly, only 25% of adults who had a positive result had their antibiotics continued versus 47% among those with a negative result. However, this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.056). It is noteworthy that all of the patients with a positive result and normal chest X-rays were no longer receiving antibiotics after 48 h. Most of the positive cases had been associated with an antibiotic discontinuation after 48 h (time of antibiotherapy reevaluation) (17/23) and were all pediatric cases. A reduction of antibiotic prescription following a positive test result has already been reported in adults [9] .",

Indeed, among the five remaining cases, three were serious influenza A virus or parainfluenza virus 3 infection, whose course had begun at least a week earlier, which might explain the moderate or low signals [10] . The influenza B virus detected only with FA (P30) from a child in ICU is more questionable, as the course was not typical of a flu infection. Moreover, influenza B virus viral load has been described as higher in ICU patients than in those in ambulatory settings [11] . This is an example of situation where a complementary semi-quantitative PCR could have been of significant value in aiding clinician decision and overall management of the patient health. The rhinovirus/ enterovirus detection (P10) is likely a real positive case with a very low signal because the clinical context was evocative of a viral bronchiolitis, and the next sampling (10 days later) showed a very high signal (data not shown). A semi-quantitative result would have indicated the start of the infection. Of note, the single freeze-thaw cycle to which the samples were subjected is not likely to be the cause of these five remaining lower viral loads, which are consistent with clinical data.",

Semi-quantitative data allows for more critical biological interpretation of the results and thus an appropriate use of them in clinic. In our study, these data could have warned physicians of a mismatch between result and clinical situation, or helped them to monitor some viral infections. The combination of qualitative multiplex testing and semi-quantitative real-time PCR in routine use for positive samples is not feasible because it would negate the benefits related to the rapidity of multiplex testing and would generate a significant additional cost. The ideal solution seems to be the development of RMPA tests that also can produce semiquantitative results. This is the case of the QIAstat Respiratory Panel (QIAstat RP, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) which has been recently commercialized.",
