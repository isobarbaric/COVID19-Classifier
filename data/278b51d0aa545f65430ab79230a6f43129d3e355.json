During this period, different forecasting models have tried to forecast time path of COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike the COVID-19 forecasting literature based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling, in this paper new COVID-19 cases were modelled and forecasted by conditional variance and asymmetric effects employing Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH), Threshold GARCH (TARCH) and Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) models. ARMA, ARMA-GARCH, ARMA-TGARCH and ARMA-EGARCH models were employed for one-day ahead forecasting performance for April, 2021 and three waves of COVID-19 pandemic in nine most affected countries \u2500USA. ARMA-GARCH models have better forecast performance than ARMA models by modelling both the conditional heteroskedasticity and the heavy-tailed distributions of the daily growth rate of the new confirmed cases; asymmetric GARCH models have shown mixed results in terms of lower the root mean squared error (RMSE).",

Many researchers from different disciplines such as health, math, engineering, finance, economics have started to employ different forecasting techniques to get a better insight into spread of pandemic. Shinde et al.

            "text": "Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is well-known time series forecasting methods especially in finance and economics. To forecast the spread of COVID-19, most of the researchers from different disciplines used ARIMA models because of their simplicity, systematic structure and acceptable forecasting performance (Wang et al., 2018) . As an early study, Ceylan (2020) used ARIMA models to forecast COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France between the period of 21/02/2020 and 15/04/2020. Since all series became stationary after the second difference, ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) were chosen by minimum MAPE value as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. The estimation period covers the all data and outof-sample period for the next 10-day was applied to forecast confirmed cases of COVID-19 in these countries. Petropoulos et al. (2020) attempted to predict the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cumulative number of deaths, using basic time series models, i.e. non-seasonal multiplicative error and multiplicative trend exponential smoothing model. They produced 12 rounds of 10-day-ahead non-overlapping forecasts, covering a four-month period from February to May 2020. Authors claim that their model results offer competitive forecast accuracy. Duan and Zhang (2020) predict the daily new confirmed cases in Japan and South Korea from 20/01/2020 until 26/05/2020 using ARIMA. ARIMA(6,1,7) and ARIMA(2,1,3) models were selected as best models for Japan and South Korea, respectively and the daily new confirmed cases for the 7-day period from April 27, 2020 to May 3, 2020 were predicted. Ribeiro et al. (2020) studied on short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states. ARIMA, cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR) and stacking-ensemble learning were used for one, three, and sixdays ahead forecasting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases. They ranked the models according to their forecasting ability based on sMAPE in all scenarios from the best to the worst, SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models, respectively. Maleki et al. (2020) modeled the total number of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world by the proposed autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models. TP-SMN-AR(7) model was selected as the best model for the estimation period from 22/01/2020 to 30/04/2020 for the total confirmed COVID-19 cases, and TP-SMN-AR(2) model was selected as the best model under the estimation period from 02/02/2020 to 30/04/2020 for the total recovered COVID-19 cases. The validation period was the last 10 days of the confirmed and recovered cases, i.e. 21/04/2020-30.04.2020. Maleki et al. (2020) claimed that proposed models improve the forecasting accuracy for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world. Malki et al. (2021) investigated the end of COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of second rebound using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, selected by AIC. Authors scaled the data using the min-max scalar function to stabilize the value of variance and improved the forecast ability of the model. The estimation period covers 70% of all data, i.e. from 22/01/2020 to 15/06/2020 and the validation period used to forecast for the next 60 days, i.e. from 15/06/2020 until 12/08/2020. Out-of-sample period starts from 13/08/2020 until 11/09/2020. Then Malki et al. (2021) try to estimate the expected deadline of COVID-19 for some countries in the first and second rebounds using the forecasted models based on normal distribution. Lastly, authors have compared the forecast performance of ARIMA, Machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning model (LSTM) and concluded that SARIMA model can be extended and used to predict confirmed cases of other countries. Talkhi et al. (2021) forecast the number of confirmed and death caused COVID-19 in Iran using nine different time series models, i.e. NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The daily confirmed and death cases data covers from 20/02/2020 until 15/08/2020 and splined train (70%) and testing part (30%), then the forecasting accuracy of the models is evaluated by RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The authors selected the ARIMA(1,0,0), i.e. AR(1), and ARIMA(1,0,1), i.e. AR(1), for confirmed and death cases, respectively. Out-of-sample period starts from 16/08/2020 until 14/09/2020 for 30 days. Empirical findings of the paper offer the MLP network model for confirmed cases forecasting and Holt-Winter model for forecasting death cases. Sahai et al. (2021) forecast daily confirmed cases for five most affected countries. ARIMA models estimated for the period of 15/02/2020-30/06/2020 and India (4,2,4), Brazil (3,1,2), Russia (3,0,0), Spain (4,2,4) and US (1,2,1) models selected by AIC. Actual data from 1st July to 18th July was used as validation period and the forecast efficiency was determined by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). MAPE was the lowest for Russia and Spain at 1.09% and 0.83%, and 3.70%,1.84% and 2.88% for India, Brazil and US, respectively.",

It is obvious that the number of daily new cases were low on the onset of the pandemic but the new cases reached over 200,000 in USA and India at the late stage of the pandemic or during the strong waves of the pandemic.

New COVID-19 cases have two outliers in USA and one outlier in Germany, so adjusted new cases are used for these outliers. On the other hand, Turkey, one of the fifth most effected country in the world, is excluded from the sample since new COVID-19 cases in Turkey has two structural breaks, which indicates that COVID-19 cases do not follow the natural trajectory of the pandemic spread. So the previous and/or future studies should take outliers in COVID-19 data and time path of the new cases into account.",

Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model usually has a better performance than traditional statistical methods like ARMA by capturing the non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series.

Thefore the paper analyzed the daily new confirmed cases, yet some issues arouse: First, for the US and Germany daily new cases showed some significant outliers. Reducing the unconditional variance is an important issue when modelling the pandemic spread since the new cases have an exponential growth characteristic in the early stage of the pandemic. As a first step, the 7 day smoothed series were used by taking 7 days moving average of the daily new confirmed cases. Some countries have included weekend lockdowns or national holiday lockdowns, consequently the cases show an irregular pattern for weekends or the days when there were legal COVID-19 restrictions. Using 7-day moving average helps to avoid this type of changes in the number of the COVID-19 cases. In other words, the forecasted value would be 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases. From now on when referring to models and estimation in this paper, \"new cases\" means daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) for the country , if otherwise noted. As the second step starting date is determined as the first day when the number of the new cases is over 100. This way it is to get rid of the early days exponential growth rates in new cases to some extent.",

Taking the first difference, i.e. , will remove the linear trend and becomes stationary and denote as I(1), integrated of order one.

Daily average of the growth rates is fluctuating between 1% -1.5%, the highest mean growth rate is 2.06% in India and the lowest one is 0.74% in UK thanks to vaccination. The maximum daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases (7 day smoothed) is 107.94% in France and the minimum is again in France with -78.25%. Standard deviation is maximum in France with 0.1135 and minimum in Russia with 0.0453 and it provides a priori knowledge about considering heterogeneity in forecast models of this study. The kurtosis of the normal distribution is 3. Then all series have high kurtosis, the distribution is leptokurtic, that is, more peaked than a normal distribution with longer tails, especially for USA. It is an outcome of wild pandemic cycle periods, i.e. the effect of uncontrolled period and controlled period on growth rates of COVID-19 cases. Skewness is a measure of asymmetry and it is expected as zero under the normal distribution. All series have positive skewness implying that the distribution has a long right tail due to high growth rates of COVID-19 cases. Skewness is maximum in USA with 6.97 and minimum in France 0.65. The Jarque-Bera test statistic is calculated based on skewness and kurtosis values of the distribution, as expected it rejects the null hypothesis of a normal distribution for all series. High standard deviation and skewness&kurtosis values of the series indicate that our forecasting models should take non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series into account. It is known that ARMA models have constant variance assumption, which means volatility in new COVID-19 cases does not any effect on forecasted new cases. If data have heavy-tailed probability distribution, then GARCH procedure ensures modelling both the conditional heteroscedasticity and the heavy-tailed distributions of the daily growth rate of the new confirmed cases.",

As a next step, ARMA(4,4) and ARMA(4,4)-GARCH(1,1) model forecasting results are compared for USA to provide a better insight on difference between the forecasted and actual series. Figure 2 shows the daily growth rate of the new cases and the forecasted growth rates. It is obvious that ARMA(4,4) model has larger fluctuations on actual growth rate of new cases in USA. Forecasted value of the new confirmed cases (7 day smoothed) can be calculated using the forecasted growth rates obtained from two main models, i.e. ARMA(4,4) and ARMA(4,4)-GARCH(1,1) models (see Figure 3 ). It can be easily seen in Figure 3 that ignoring the conditional variance caused weak forecast power. Table 2 shows the statistical properties of deviations presented in Fig.4 . The mean of the deviations for 30 observations is 152 new cases for GARCH model but 471 new cases for ARMA model. It is clear that the maximum (3,504 for ARMA and 1,504 for GARCH) and the minimum (-3,522 for ARMA and -1,260 for GARCH) deviations from the actual ones are so high for ARMA model, which causes a high standard deviation for ARMA model.

Most of the countries faced three COVID-19 waves; first wave was at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, second wave was seen during the last months of the 2020 and third one was around March,2021. However, pandemic has its own growing path for most of the countries since its spread rate depends on so many variables such as age structure, health expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, population density, public measures and so on. Fig. 5 . COVID-19 waves (shaded areas) in nine most affected countries Figure 5 presents COVID-19 waves in the nine most affected countries. The waves were defined based on before and after 15 days of the local maximum of the new cases (smoothed). As seen in Figure 5 and Table 3 , the time periods of the waves have changed between countries; India has single wave while Russia has two waves. Table 3 shows the one-step ahead forecast model results in terms of RMSE for the first COVID-19 wave. The model results confirm the forecast results of April, 2021; all countries have lower RMSE when using the ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(1,1) model. Taking into account heteroscedasticity is an essential part for forecasting models. However, asymmetric effect has shown some mixed results as it did in baseline validation period, April 2021 (see Table 2 ). Some of the TGARCH or EGARCH models are better than GARCH models, for example while TGARCH works better for India and for Brazil, France, Russia, UK for both models work well; on the other hand, Italy, Spain and Germany have higher RMSE values, even higher than ARMA models in some cases 3 . Table 4 shows the second COVID-19 wave for eight countries. ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(1,1) models have still lower RMSE but not for all countries, France and UK have slightly lower RMSE under the ARMA models. Asymmetric GARCH Models have still mixed performance results. The model results for the third COVID-19 wave is presented in Table 5 . GARCH models have better performance accuracy for USA, Brazil and Germany in terms of RMSE, the loss of forecasting power is small for France, UK, Italy and strong for Spain. Including asymmetric effect into the variance equation creates higher RMSE for most of the countries.",

Since COVID-19 pandemic is a multidisciplinary research area, many researchers from different disciplines have contributed to the literature using mathematical models or machine learning techniques. ARIMA models are well-known time series models to forecast univariate variables such as new COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, the main assumption behind the ARIMA models are that the expected variance of all error terms is the same at any given point, i.e. homoskedasticity assumption. However, COVID-19 pandemic has strong waves, which leads heavy-tailed distributions. GARCH models are able to capture the non-lineraties and heterogeneity of the time series. Asymmetric effect is another feature of GARCH-type models, i.e. TGARCH and EGARCH, by measuring the differential effects of negative or positive shocks on conditional variance.",

Using packages in Python, R or similar programs also support this type of analysis, without noticing the data cleaning and data transformation. Before the modelling stage, we should make sure that input data is appropriate for this kind of modelling.

The same situation is observed in another date; the number of new cases in USA was 41,486 on 3/9/2021, jumped to 126,229 on 3/10/2021 then decreased to 52,732 on 3/11/2021.

To get rid of such outliers in this paper, the outlier days are taken as the average value of the day before and after the outlier day. Accordingly, the adjusted number of the new cases will be 215,086 on 12/20/2020 and 47,109 on 3/10/2021 for USA and 20,115.5 on 4/19/2021 for Germany. The second issue is about the path of time series of Turkey. The new cases in Turkey have two structural breaks, one on 7/29/2020 and one on 11/27/2020. Therefore, Turkey was excluded from the sample (for all the data processes, find the attached Excel file).",
