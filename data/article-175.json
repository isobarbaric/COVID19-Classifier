            "text": "Objectives: The outbreak of novel coronavirus provided an opportunity to undertake an online survey to study the relationships between body weight changes with changes in physical activity and lifestyle during an unusual event of forced isolation, or quarantine. Methods: We distributed an electronic questionnaire using the popular social application WeChat to adults from any province of China except Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The questionnaire asked for demographic information, body weight, physical activity, and lifestyle factors before and during the quarantine. Results: Of 376 questionnaires returned, 339 were valid (90.2%). During the period of semi-lockdown, both females and males with BMI <24 gained weight, males with BMI \u226524 lost weight, and females with BMI \u226524 gained weight. The average steps per day and the average moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise declined significantly for both males and females during the semi-lockdown. Changes in body weight inversely correlated with changes in steps per day and moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise during the quarantine. Conclusions: Normal weight individuals, who are not normally troubled by overweight or obesity, had less awareness of weight gain than people with a BMI \u2265 24. Under the conditions of the semi-lockdown, they tended to gain weight."

Curfew and quarantine measures were implemented in many mainland cities. The flow of people was controlled by allowing only 1 person from each household to go out to buy necessities every 2-3 d. All of these measures to reduce transmission of the virus proved effective because by early March, the number of new cases was declining. The WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019, conducted from February 16 to 24, 2020, reported that the country was beginning to return to normal."

The first part requested demographic and anthropometric information, including home domicile, gender, age, height, and weight changes (5 wk before and during the COVID-19 virus outbreak). From these data, we calculated body mass index (BMI), and the change in body weight from before until after the semi-lockdown. A high BMI for both males and females was a BMI \u2265 24. The second part requested information on participant lifestyle before the Epidemic Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019, such as the frequency of dinner parties of typically 8-10 people, amount of alcohol consumed during parties, the frequency of snacks, and lifestyle changes during period of semi-lockdown. The third part was about attitudes toward weight control and diet control (intention to control food intake, intention to remain physically active). We also collected data on exercise, including average number of walking steps and average of medium-or vigorous-intensity exercise time per day before (December 23, 2019, to January 26, 2020) and during (January 27, 2020, to March 1, 2020) semi-lockdown. The data for the third part were retrieved through Smartphone health software, such as Exercise Health or Keep. No financial and other material incentives were offered to the participants. We deployed the questionnaire on WeChat in early March and collected data until 20 March 2020."

This is consistent with the findings of the China Kadoorie Biobank study and the European Kardiovize Brno 2030 Study in which greater physical activity was related to a lower BMI. 11, 12 In our study, people with a BMI < 24 were not normally troubled by overweight or obesity, but also had less awareness of weight gain than people with a BMI \u2265 24.

The limitations of our study are the relatively small sample size and short 5-wk period of the study. Some provinces in China cancelled the first level response to the public health emergency and some industries have resumed production, so the flow of personnel began to increase, which may have caused weight changes to eb affected by other factors.

            "text": "In conclusion, the virus that causes COVID-19 is still prevalent all over the world. Some countries have gradually adopted forced isolation measures such as lockdown and reducing the flow of people. Such measures force changes in lifestyle, which may lead to changes in body weight. Normal weight individuals may not normally be troubled by overweight or obesity and may have less awareness of weight gain than people with a BMI \u2265 24. Therefore, normal weight as well as overweight and obese people should be aware of the need for weight control when physical activity is necessarily reduced by epidemic prevention and control measures.
