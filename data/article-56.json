One blank (Milli-Q water) and one in-house standard were injected after every five measured samples. The in-house standard was prepared using the gravimetric dilution technique from Sigma-Aldrich TraceCERT\uf6da ion chromatography SRMs. The blank corrected concentrations of ions were calculated based on a 5-point standard calibration curve. Analytical precision was within 5% for all the analytes (anions and cations) and accuracy was within 5%."

Figure S1 : Figure S6 : Effect of lockdown restrictions on dissolved trace metals (Li, Sr, As, and Ba). The percent changes were calculated with respect to the pre-COVID-19 (Li+Sr+As+Ba)/Rb ratios. 31 We set up a range (75\u221292) for the pre-COVID-19 period by providing \u00b110% variability of the average (Li+Sr+As+Ba)/Rb Ganga river composition (84; n=131). 31 The percent change for each river water sample was then calculated 10000 times against data randomly selected from a uniform distribution of the pre-COVID-19 range. Each circle reports the mean of all 10000 iterations, and one standard deviation was considered as the uncertainty (error bar). The filled squares denote the weekly averages."
