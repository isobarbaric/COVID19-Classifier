However, studies in both animal models and two-dimensional cell cultures often fail to translate into human patients, as neither model accurately mimics human physiology. To accelerate drug development, researchers need alternative ways to model human diseases. The term \"organ-on-a-chip,\" as well as the technology, was initially developed by Donald Ingber, founder of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the scientific founder of Emulate, Inc. (Figure 1 ). \"These are microfluidic devices lined with living human cells that recreate the tissue-tissue interfaces and physical microenvironment of organs,\" says Ingber. \"I describe them as living, three-dimensional cross sections of the major functional units of an organ. We are not building a whole organ; we want to have a window on molecular-scale activity inside living cells.\""

The focus of the CBC is to develop cell-based assays its researchers can use to learn about chemical and biological agents. One reason the CBC is equipped to perform this research is its Biosafety Level 3 facility, which is a laboratory under higher levels of containment where some of the deadlier biological agents can be handled safely. This includes the SARS-CoV-2 virus."

We know a lot about how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells and replicates, but we don't know everything. With these Lung-Chips, we are attempting to collect RNA and protein from the cells and subject that to various analyses to look at the transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome. With that information, we can begin to make predictions about different cellular pathways that are impacted and, specifically, how the virus is affecting lung cells.\" Additionally, Goralski and Angelini hope to determine the exact infectious dose and time the cascade of events inside the lung tissue when that threshold is reached."
