            "text": "The food environment is a major contributor to unhealthy diets in children and, therefore, to the increasing rates of obesity. Acclaimed by scholars across the world, Latin American countries have been leaders in implementing policies that target different aspects of the food environment. Evidence on the nature and to what extent children are exposed and respond to unhealthy food environments in the region and among Latinos in the United States is, however, deficient. The objective of this review is to use the integrated International Network for Food and Obesity/noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) framework to create healthy food environment to (i) compare the key elements of childhood obesity-related food environments in Latin America and for Latinos living in the United States; (ii) describe the evidence on solutions to improve childhood obesity-related food environments; and (iii) identify research priorities to inform solutions to fight childhood obesity in these populations. We found that an integrated body of evidence is needed to inform an optimal package of policies to improve food environments to which children in Latin America and Latino children in the United States are exposed and more efficiently translate policy solutions to help curb growing childhood obesity levels across borders."

            "text": "Children of Latino heritage in the United States and children living in Latin America have a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and other ultra-processed foods, key contributors to obesity, 1 noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), 2,3 and mortality. 4 A large body of evidence indicates that the food environment in which a person evolves contributes to unhealthy diets. 5 Food environments have been defined as the \"conditions that influence people's food and beverage choices and nutritional status\" and include physical (e.g., availability, quality, marketing, and promotion), economic (cost), policy (rules), and sociocultural (e.g., social norms and preferences) dimensions. 5 Promoting and protecting healthy food environments is particularly important for children, considering the links between the food environment and food preferences, behaviors, and appetite-satiety signaling, which track into adolescence and adulthood. 6 Public policies and interventions that seek to protect and promote healthy food environments are important strategies to childhood obesity prevention and control. 7,8 Following the experience with tobacco control, policies such as increased taxation, marketing restrictions, and warning labels have recently been adopted to improve food environments as well. 9,10 These policies are usually aimed at reducing purchases of SSBs and other ultra-processed foods. 11, 12 In fact, countries in Latin America have been leaders in this realm. Mexico was the first country to implement taxes on both SSBs and selected ultra-processed foods, with other countries following suit ( Figure 1 ). Chile implemented the world's first mandatory frontof-package (FoP) warning label system, 13 which has since been adopted across Latin America and elsewhere ( Figure 2 ). Yet, despite the extensive literature on the links between the food environment and diet, and the rapidly growing evidence on policies used to promote healthier food environments, less evidence is available for related issues concerning children, including Latin American children and children of Latino heritage living in other countries such as the United States. 14 The objectives of the present review are to use the INFORMAS framework to compare and contrast the key elements of the food environment related to childhood obesity in Latin America and for Latinos living in the United States, describe the evidence on available solutions to improve childhood obesity-related food environments, and identify research priorities to inform solutions that help reduce childhood obesity rates and that can be translated across borders."

Food labeling is important for healthy food environment because labels help inform and guide consumers in making healthier choices and, in some cases, incentivize the food industry to create healthier products. 19 However, the information provided on food labels is complex and does not always help guide consumers towards the healthier choice."

In countries where the NFP is required, the information may differ (e.g., whether added sugar, total sugar, or both is required). In addition, whether and how the NFP is used by consumers varies considerably. In the United States, about half of adults report using the NFP, although actual use may be lower. Latino adults are less likely to use the NFP. 20-22 Similar inequalities have been found in Latin America. 23, 24 In Brazil, adolescents who reported using the NFP had a lower consumption of ultra-processed foods, 25 but NFP use, and disparities in use, by children remains unclear. In both the United States and Latin America, consumers report the NFP to be confusing and that they prefer nutrition information on the front of the package. [26] [27] [28] However, this is concerning, because other labeling elements on the front of the package, such as nutrition claims, can mislead consumers to think a product is healthier than it is. 29-31 Nutrition claims are common in both the United States and Latin America, including on foods advertised to children. [32] [33] [34] In both regions, studies have found that products with claims are more likely to have excess levels of nutrients of concern such as sugar or sodium than those that do not have nutrition claims. 33,35 Thus, reliance on nutrition claims may mislead consumers and contribute to purchases of SSBs and ultra-processed foods."

Although FoP labeling models such as health stars or color-coded traffic light labels have gained popularity in other parts of the globe, proposals in Latin America and the United States have focused primarily on placing FoP warnings on foods high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. 36 Chile was the first country to implement a mandatory national FoP nutrient warning label policy in 2016, 37 followed by Peru, Israel, Uruguay, and Mexico. 38 Brazil has passed similar regulations, and a warning label law is under consideration by Colombia's congress. These warnings typically include text statements denoting high or excess levels of nutrients of concern, including added sugar, sodium, saturated fat, trans fat, and in some cases, energy, or low-calorie sweeteners. The warnings also often, but not always, use shapes, text, or colors intended to signal a warning and to discourage consumption (i.e., a red stop sign or text that says, \"avoid excess consumption\"). The proposed mechanism is that the labels grab consumers' attention, elicit negative affect and thinking about the health harms of excess consumption, motivate behavioral intentions, and, ultimately, reduce purchases of SSBs and ultra-processed foods. 39 In the United States, no warning label legislation has been implemented, but nine jurisdictions have proposed health warnings on SSB containers, advertisements, or at the point of sale. 40"

[46] [47] [48] In terms of real-world evaluations, a recent study of SSB purchases after implementation of Chile's law found that SSB purchases declined by nearly 24% in the first 18 months, although Chile's law combines marketing and labeling policies. 9 A qualitative study found that children can be a major mechanism for driving behavior change, with children learning at school what the labels mean, and asking their mothers not to purchase snacks or foods with the warning labels on them. 49 Food reformulation after the law was enacted was observed, resulting in a 20% reduction in high-sugar products and a 47% reduction in high-sodium products. 50 Concerns related to potential unintended consequences of reformulation in response to labeling policies remain, in particularly those related to low-calorie sweeteners. 50 These substances are found in at least 10% of the foods sold in Latin America and the United States. [51] [52] [53] Despite international recommendations that discourage the consumption of low-calorie sweeteners by children, these are found in foods advertised to Latin American children 54 often without any information that could help caregivers identify their presence in foods and beverages. 55 Consequently, 20% of Latino children and adolescents living in the United States report low-calorie sweeteners consumption. 56 Prior to the implementation of the Food Labeling and Advertising Law in Chile, low-calorie sweeteners were found in the diet of up to 60% of children. 57 Such consumption increased by 10% among preschoolers following the changes in nutritional labeling in that country. 58 The long-term consequences of the use of low-calorie sweeteners at young ages include greater risk of developing NCDs as adults and long-lasting preference for sweetened foods. 59 In the short term, the consumption of low-calorie sweeteners is associated with greater body mass index (BMI) and body fat. 60 "

Broadly, a key area for additional research is understanding how FoP labeling efforts interact with other elements of food environment policies for children. For example, the Chilean experience suggests that the simultaneous restrictions on the sales and provision of foods high in critical nutrients inside schools were essential for parents to understand the FoP, but the mechanisms need further investigation. In addition, evidence on FoP impact is missing about US Latino parents and children, particularly those with low English literacy, which is important to understand if lessons learned from Latin America will apply in the US context."

The WHO calls for regulations to restrict marketing of foods and beverages to children (2-17 years) as a global health priority. 64 In Latin America, the United States, and across the globe, research consistently documents high exposure to TV advertising for ultraprocessed foods, especially on children's programming and during peak viewing times. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Marketing tactics that disproportionately appeal to children, such as licensed cartoon characters, brand spokescharacters, promotions, and fun/cool emotional appeals are common on TV and product packaging. [71] [72] [73] [74] Research documenting other types of child-directed food marketing is limited. However, TV advertising represents just one third of the $1.8 billion that US food companies spend on marketing directed at children (2-17 years). 75 Furthermore, expenditures on digital marketing and other nonbroadcast marketing (including product placements, sponsorships, philanthropic promotions, and celebrity endorsements) have increased. In particular, digital marketing that targets children on mobile devices encourages viral sharing with peers, collects personal data, and blurs the distinction between advertising and entertainment in a way that is unfair and deceptive. 76 In addition, companies utilize integrated marketing strategies designed to reach customers with a consistent message \"everywhere.\" 77 In the United States, Latino-targeted marketing also contributes to diet-related health disparities affecting Latino communities. 78 Food companies spent $800 million to disproportionately target advertising to Latino consumers on Spanish-language TV. 79 Furthermore, Spanish-speaking youth visit food-company websites 80 and engage with more food brands on social media 81 than white, non-Hispanic youth."

In the United States, First Amendment protections on corporate speech make it more difficult to prioritize \"children's rights.\" For example, Brazil takes a broad child rights approach and prohibits \"abusive publicity\" intended to persuade children and adolescents to consume any product using strategies with child appeals. Enforcement of these restrictions is challenging. In fact, 80% of all food-related ads shown on the three major Brazilian free-to-air TV channels included unhealthy foods and were largely from a handful number of national and transnational food companies and large supermarket chains. 93 In 2015, Chile implemented the most comprehensive statutory policy to date prohibiting advertising of products with a high content of calories, saturated fat, sugar, and/or sodium on TV programming and websites with 20% or more children (under age 14) in the audience and child-directed advertising on radio and in magazines. 91 Chile also restricts promotional strategies and incentives with child appeals in product packaging, including licensed and brand characters, interactive games, and toys. Two years after the regulation was implemented, the prevalence of TV ads with foods high in critical nutrients decreased in TV programming primarily targeted to children, as well as for general audiences. 94 Declines were also observed on the use of child-directed strategies on cereal packages, accompanied by an increase in the consumption of breakfast cereals with less sugar. 73 These studies will be instrumental to advance food marketing policies in other countries and to inform the development of effective policy solutions."

A child rights-based approach to food marketing policy requires research on the broader impact of child-directed food marketing on children's rights (e.g., privacy and healthy development) and practices that take unfair advantage of their vulnerabilities. Evaluations of enacted policies should include pre-and postimplementation measures to assess changes in children's exposure to marketing, purchases and/or consumption of regulated products, and on the overall diet. How and whether policies are delivered as expected and the food industry responses should also be included in evaluations. Previous regulations have led companies to reformulate products with questionable improvements (e.g., increasing the use of unregulated marketing practices).

For instance, when the unit of comparison for foods is energy ($/kcal), fresh produce seems much more expensive than energy-dense snacks, whereas the opposite will be the case if the unit of comparison is the edible weight ($/g). 97, 98 Moreover, analyses that evaluate the cost and quality of individuals' dietary intake cannot fully disentangle effects of food prices versus other factors that influence diet. In the United States, diet quality and cost are positively associated among non-Latino populations, but not among Latinos. 99 A possible explanation is that food price environments are different in Latino neighborhoods. A small study in Southern California found that prices of produce were lower in ethnic Mexican stores, 100 whereas a study on supermarkets throughout the United States found no major difference between the healthy-to-unhealthy price ratio across neighborhoods with different proportions of Black/Latinos. 101 Another explanation is that a more culturally acceptable healthy diet for Latinos is indeed not more expensive than an unhealthy diet even in the United States."

However, even if cost is not a barrier for healthy diets, fiscal policies are still valuable to counteract other factors promoting the intake of SSBs and other ultra-processed foods such as convenience, marketing, and palatability. A meta-analysis of prospective and intervention studies, mainly from the United States, found that a 10% decrease in the price of healthy foods (e.g., subsidy) increased their intake by 12%, whereas a 10% increase in price of unhealthy foods (e.g., tax) decreased their intake by 6%. 108 To date, disincentives on unhealthy products, mainly SSBs, have been the most common fiscal strategy. SSB taxes have been purchases after the tax, suggesting that they can gain more health benefits. In Mexico, rural areas, which are poorer than urban areas, did not benefit from the tax as price increases were not passed to consumers. 110, 111 A major gap remains with regards to fiscal policies that incentivize healthier purchases, as to date, evidence on price discounts or subsidies to healthy foods is limited to small-scale interventions and randomized trials. 112,113 "

A review focused on US policies found that laws and regulations influenced consumption or food availability in the expected direction, although effects on total dietary intake were less clear. 130 A recent meta-analysis quantified the impact of school food environment policies on dietary habits, adiposity, and metabolic risk in children and found that, although policies can improve targeted behaviors, the long-term effects are unclear. 131 In Chile, the availability of foods and beverages exceeding nutrient thresholds decreased after the policy was passed. 132 In Mexico, 133, 134 2 years after the enactment of the guidelines, restricted foods were found in schools. Evidence from Costa Rica revealed the importance of selecting concrete and measurable objectives or goals and supporting stakeholders during the implementation process. 135 For instance, food vendors continued to sell products that did not comply with the guidelines because they did not understand the regulation, to maintain profits, and as a result of poor enforcement. 135 and what has contributed to uptake and evaluate the impact of these policies on students' diets, educational outcomes, and health, and on the food system, including on the livelihood of family farmers. Unequal access to healthy foods is also a reality in both settings, disproportionally affecting low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. 140, 141 A wealth of studies considers proximity and exposure to large food retailers such as supermarkets close to home a proxy for access to healthy foods. However, in the United States, most individuals travel, on average, 6 km away from home to shop for food. 142 Secondly, supermarkets are the main source of calories from ultra-processed foods, 142 and Latino families obtain the largest share of calories from grocery stores and supermarkets and the least from quick-service and full-service restaurants compared with other racial/ ethnic groups. 143 Similarly, the largest share of calories consumed by American children that come from selected ultra-processed foods (e.g., SSBs, snacks, and grain-based desserts) is purchased in grocery stores and supermarkets. 143 In Latin America, the retail share of grocery stores and supermarkets varies by economic development and level of foreign direct investments. 144 In Brazil, foods purchased at supermarkets account for 60% of the population's total energy intake and 60% of the calories that come from ultra-processed foods. 145 In other countries, such as Peru and Bolivia, where the participation of farmers' markets, produce markets, and other traditional retailers (butchers, tiendas, etc.) in the food supply is larger, this figure is likely to be lower. 144 In fact, certain types of traditional retailers, like farmers' markets and produce markets, are recognized as important sources of unprocessed and minimally processed foods. 145 Aside from the influence of the retail food environment on households with children, research suggests that children influence parents' purchasing behavior, both among Latinos in the United States 146, 147 and in Latin America. 148 Although parents report buying ultra-processed foods to please their children in both settings, 148 Latino children and parents mutually influence each other's choices at the point of purchase. 146, 147 Additionally, Latino parents in the United"

Such an integrated body of evidence is still needed for the design and implementation of an optimal package of policies aimed at transforming the various aspects of a childhood obesityrelated food environment and the unequal access to healthy diets."

For instance, among Latinos living in the United States, acculturation and the length of time living in the United States can weaken ties to traditional diets from countries of origins and are associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods. 15 Different governmental systems, norms and laws, and political viability to implement nationwide policies and interventions targeted at shaping food environments lead to greater or lower exposure to unhealthy food environments. However, because Latin American children and children of Latino heritage living in the United States share similar food cultures, health concerns, and, in many cases, food environment challenges, understanding whether and to what extent the food environments the children are exposed in both settings are similar can help shape more effective policies and population strategies. The International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) provides a useful framework for identifying and monitoring key elements of the food environment and how they interact to produce effects on children's diet and health (Figure 3). 16 This framework addresses key components of the food environment that are related to childhood obesity prevention, including food labeling, food promotion, food prices, food provisions in schools, private sector policies and actions, and food trade and investment.

Additional research needs include (i) evaluation of the impact of taxes on overall dietary intake, not only on taxed items or their direct substitutes; (ii) longer term evaluations to understand if and when consumers adjust to price changes and return to pretax purchasing levels; and (iii) whether these policies contribute to widening health inequalities, and what measures more effectively help mitigate unintended consequences. 113 Although SSB taxes can help reduce income-related health inequalities, this question is particularly important to address among US Latinos, because, to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether there is a differential impact of SSB or other taxes among Latino populations. Cross-country research that compares taxes in the US to Latin American countries could be useful for addressing this question. Finally, pricing strategies have primarily focused on taxation of unhealthy foods. Large-scale and empirical evidence on the effects of subsidies to healthy foods such as fruits andvegetables is lacking, as well as subsidies to commodities such as corn and soybean that disincentivize agricultural diversity and are used in ultra-processed foods.111",

This law requires that 30% of all foods procured for school meals must come from family farmers. 118 In 2013, the Brazilian program's nutritional guidelines were strengthened by increasing the mandatory minimum number of servings of fruits and vegetables per week, prohibiting soda and a few other sugary drinks, and imposing maximum values for added sugar, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium in allowed foods.

One of the few studies employing a quasi-experimental design using a sample of schoolaged children living in Arkansas, USA, found that the opening of a supermarket had a positive effect in low-income children's BMI, but the closing of supermarkets did not alter children's weight.157 In the United States, a federal initiative to incentivize grocery stores and supermarkets to open in areas lacking access to nutritious, supply-and demand-side interventions in improving diet that deserves to be further studied. Similarly, stocking improvements that followed the recent revisions of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) have been observed in many US cities, 161 they did not vary by neighborhood racial/ethnic composition162 and seemed to improve dietary intake.161 Less is known about the impact of retailer-based policies in Latin America. Mexico's recent ban on the sales of ultra-processed foods and SSBs to children under 18, recently implemented in the state of Oaxaca, is promising. Although the impact of this ban on children's purchases and intake has yet to be evaluated, evidence from similar tobacco control measures163 and bans on sales of electronic cigarettes to children and adolescents164,165 suggests that such a ban can reduce ultra-processed food purchases.Finally, the role of produce or farmers markets in Latin America in the provision of unprocessed and minimally processed foods deserves to be explored, which may have been enhanced during the restricted phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.6.2 | Research agendaMore research is needed to understand (i) the impact of food retailers, and different food retailer types, on the healthfulness of purchases of Latin American children and parents, and how this differs across countries, with robust statistical methods to deal with concerns relating to endogeneity and selectivity of retailer's decisions to locate in particular places; and (ii) interventions to improve the healthfulness of purchases within retailers (e.g., banning ultra-processed foods in checkout), as well as whether the impact of these interventions and policies differs for Latino children and parents in the United States and in Latin America.",

For instance, in Colombia, when a new FoP was discussed in Congress, an \"Alliance for Child Nutrition\" was launched by the food industry in the presence of the first lady of Colombia.174 The Alliance was then supported by the Attorney General, the Ministry of Health, the Presidential Council for Children and Adolescents, and the National Association of Neonatology.174 Food companies also influence the science on childhood obesity in Latin America, with Coca-Cola, for example, funding large projects and local researchers on that topic,175 despite the clear vested interests the company has in the area. In Colombia, food companies' employees provide training to health professionals working with children as part of a national program.172 In Chile, food companies regularly sponsor pediatrics and nutrition annual congresses.176 These political practices to influence public policy, research, and practice in Latin America172,174,177 are consistent with those used by food industry actors around the world,[178][179][180][181][182] including the United States.168 Today, in isolation and when combined, these practices are a major obstacle in the protection and promotion of healthy diets and in the fight against childhood obesity.[168][169][170] 7.1 | Solutions and strategiesRaising public awareness about the food industry political practices is an important first step. Better protection of whistleblowers and public health advocates in their work in trying to protect and promote healthy diets and foods environments is also warranted. Public health professionals, government officials, and teachers should assess the risks when collaborating with food industry actors, particularly with initiatives car-ried out in communities and targeted at vulnerable populations, like children. Finally, food industry actors and their allies with a vested financial interest should not participate in the decision-making stage of public health policy, as suggested by the WHO. 182 7.2 | Research agenda There are four main areas of research on the political practices of the food industry that could be explored in order to protect child health and prevent and control childhood obesity: 173 (i) continued identification and monitoring of the political practices of corporations; (ii) more research on similarities and differences in practices used by food industry actors when targeting Latino children in the United States compared with children in Latin America; (iii) benchmarking of governments, who have a duty to protect and promote population and child health and rights, and other actors like those in academia and professional associations, for efforts in trying to address and manage the political influence of the food industry; and (iv) better understanding of upstream, global drivers of ill-health, such as neoliberal policies and capitalism, and their role in facilitating the use of political practices by food industry actors.",

            "text": "In addition, we identified critical gaps in knowledge cutting across all sectors that need to be addressed and guide the development of effective childhood obesity prevention policies. First, cross-country comparisons-learning what works in one country and whether it could work well in another country-are missing. It is particularly relevant to understand the impact of food environment policies in Latin America because of the region's leadership in implementing innovative and comprehensive policies. Rigorous evaluations employing strong natural experimental designs and exploiting cross-country differences in policy design can help inform which policies are most effective at shifting the food system and children's diets. Similarly, whether food environment policies that have worked in Latin America would be effective for Latino children in the United States remain unclear.Children and families from Latino heritage may respond differently given distinct commands of the English language and food environments (e.g., if SSB health warnings use English text, they may not be well understood by those with low English literacy).The potential impact of food policies on obesity is somewhat modest when a single policy is applied alone,201,202 which reinforces the need for sustaining action and combining regulatory measures to detect tangible progress in childhood obesity. In most cases, we assume that policies will have a unidirectional and single effect. However, in reality, childhood obesity is the result of multiple factors and actors that act interdependently, and therefore, using system science approaches that consider positive and negative feedback may help us understand real-life impacts.203",
