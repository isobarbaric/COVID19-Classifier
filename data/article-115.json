            "text": "The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance, and determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages"

At present, the need for assays for rapid detection for diagnosis and surveillance, understanding the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus would be central for managing the spread of the epidemic [1, 2] . The advantage of quick sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome led to the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic assays that leveraged rapid identification of infected individuals to get fast medical support or quantization essential to both patient management and incidence tracking [3] . Identification of early imported cases in France helped to prevent immediate secondary transmission [4] . Singapore's enhanced surveillance and containment strategy also led to the suppressed expansion of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . On similar grounds, The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) have rapidly expanded their national surveillance system to combat SARS-CoV-2 [6] . Coupled with a highly accurate and high-throughput method of detection, this approach is expected to become more effective in dealing with COVID-19."

These methods are majorly subdivided into antigen-antibody based serological assays, nucleic acid-based amplification assays, and sequencing-based assays. While serological assays are rapid detection tests, they have low sensitivity and specificity [7] . Nucleic acid-based amplification such as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been the gold standard in detection and diagnosis, but a negative RT-PCR does not eliminate the possibility of infection in clinically suspected cases [8] . Such results should be carefully interpreted to avoid false-negative reporting [9] . Moreover, these tests have been developed for diagnostic purposes and do not provide much information on the nature of the virus, its genetic information, and evolutionary pattern. In this regard, recently developed next-generation sequencing-based methods are potentially a good alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [10] ."

Viral RNA sequencing from the initial cluster of cases deciphered the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 [11] . This led to other sequencing-based studies for detailed genomic characterization of the virus [12] . Combined genetic and epidemiological studies have been suggested to provide insights into the spread of the infection, evolutionary patterns, and genetic diversity of the virus, [1, 2] for effective management and preventive measures. Genomic surveillance coupled with agent-based modeling in Australia has been observed as an excellent approach to investigate and regulate COVID-19 transmission [13] . Towards these efforts, several openly available databases have also been developed such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) that facilitates rapid and open sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences [14] . Thus, along with detection, sequencing-based methods may also provide an added advantage of understanding the genetic epidemiology of the outbreak."

Among these, 655 (87.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive on RT-PCR as per the diagnostic guidelines laid out by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). We included 19 samples that were RT-PCR negative (2.5%) and 43 samples (5.7%) were categorised as pan-sarbeco, since they were positive for the E gene primers only. E gene is conserved across all betacoronaviruses and its detection in the sample indicates the presence of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 or other bat-CoVs. A total of 35 samples (4.6%) were considered inconclusive as the samples had one of the two genes (i.e. ORF1ab gene) tested positive. In these samples, the E gene was tested negative hence these samples were termed inconclusive. Apart from this, the sequencing panel consisted of 8 COV-IDSeq Positive Control HT (CPC HT) and 8 no template control (NTC) as internal process controls making total samples to 768. The quality of the pooled library was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and fragment analyzer which showed the fragment size to be around 300bp. The panel was sequenced in technical duplicates making it a total of 1536 samples in total. The sequencing was performed for 36 cycles. The runtime of the sequencer was 11 hours. Sequencing generated a total of 705.64 Gb of data with 86.90% cluster passing filter and 95.62% above the quality cutoff of (QC) 30. Sequencing generated on an average of approximately 8.4 million reads for the 1,536 samples. The schematic of the COVIDSeq pipeline is depicted in Fig 1. The COVID-19 detection was performed using the DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test pipeline that implements SARS-CoV-2 detection criteria of at least 5 SARS-CoV-2 targets to be considered as positive. Out of the 1,504 samples, the DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test pipeline successfully annotated 1,352 samples. Further 136 samples were classified as undetected, and 16 failed the internal quality check. This corresponds to 676 unique samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected, 68 unique samples in which SARS-CoV2 was undetected, and 8 unique samples that failed the assay. There was no discordance in the annotations between any of the 752 sample duplicates considered, suggesting a cent percent concordance in the detection. The total runtime for the DRAGEN COVIDSeq pipeline was 374 minutes. The stepwise runtime is summarised in the S1 Table. All samples were also further considered for in-depth alignment and on average 8.4 million raw reads were generated for 1,536 samples, which were trimmed at base quality Q30 and read length of 30 bps that lead to an average of 7.9 million reads. The trimmed reads were further aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) and SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2). On average we found 2.4 million human reads with a mapping percentage of 30.73% and 5.04 million SARS-CoV-2 reads with a mapping percentages of 63.89% "

The genome Wuhan/WH01 (EPI_ISL_406798) was used as the reference for constructing the tree. Clades were assigned according to the nomenclature defined by Nextstrain [15] The resulting phylogenetic tree suggests that out of 469 COVIDSeq genomes, 451 genomes (96%) fell into the A2a clade while 14 genomes (3%) mapped to the I/A3i clade, a distinct clade previously defined for genomes from India [16] . A total of 4 genomes mapped to the B4 clade. The phylogenetic clusters for the genomes are summarised in The sensitivity of the assay was benchmarked across 649 RT-PCR as well as COVIDSeq confirmed dataset. The analysis revealed the assay had a sensitivity of 97.53% compared to RT-PCR. Since we had only 19 RT-PCR negative samples, we did not assess the specificity of the assay. The comparison of RT-PCR with COVIDSeq assay has been summarized in S5 Table. Notwithstanding, the DRAGEN COVIDSeq protocol identified SARS-CoV-2 in the samples which were negative for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by the protocol in 21 samples that were inconclusive and 16 samples that were "

Our comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 detection with RT-PCR and COVIDSeq test showed that the COVIDseq test has comparable sensitivity, precision and accuracy compared to RT-PCR. COVIDSeq protocol detected SARS-CoV-2 in samples previously categorised as inconclusive (21/35), pan-sarbeco (16/43), and negative (6/19) using RT-PCR assays suggesting a comparable sensitivity of the sequencing-based assay compared to RT-PCR. This corresponded to an additional 43/97 samples and a potential gain of 5.71% of samples of the whole dataset and 44.33% of the samples which were considered inconclusive (N = 97), suggesting that the sequencing approach could be used as a potential orthogonal approach to confirm cases that are doubtful or inconclusive in RT-PCR. Notwithstanding the advantage, 16 samples that were annotated positive in RT-PCR were missed in the COVIDSeq approach. Our analysis also suggests the protocol is compatible with different approaches for RNA isolation suggesting wider applicability in clinical settings where pooling from different labs becomes inevitable."

Custom databases were created for annotations on functional consequences, potential immune epitopes, protein domains, and evolutionary conservation scores. Genomic loci associated with common errorprone sites and diagnostic primer/probe regions were manually curated and were systematically converted to data tables compatible with ANNOVAR for added annotation options. The functional relevance of the identified genetic variants was also analyzed. The variants were systematically compared with a manually curated compendium of SARS-CoV-2 variations with potential functional impacts compiled from literature reports [35] . All the filtered variants were checked with other viral genomes submitted from India and worldwide. Genomes with alignment percentage of at least 99 and gap percentage <1 were filtered as high quality. A total of 1372 high-quality genomes from India out of 1888 submitted till July 28, 2020, were included in the analysis. Similarly, global genomes submitted till August 07, 2020, were included, accounting for 29,177 high-quality genomes out of 79,764. Details of the samples, originating and submitting laboratories are listed in the S7 Table. Mutation information provided by Nextstrain [33] till August 08, 2020, was also used for comparison."

The sample names and the name of the originating and submitting institutions are listed in S8 Table. We followed a previously described protocol for phylogenetic clustering [36] . A total of 26 COV-IDSeq genomes having Ns > 5% were removed from the analysis. Genomes from GISAID having Ns > 5% and ambiguous dates of sample collection were also excluded from the analysis. The phylogenetic network was built using the analysis protocol for SARS-CoV-2 genomes provided by Nextstrain [15] . The genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT to the reference genome and problematic variant positions were masked [37] . A raw phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQTREE and the raw tree was refined to construct a molecular-clock phylogeny, infer mutations, and identify clades [38] . The resulting phylogenetic tree was viewed using Auspice, an interactive visualization web-application provided by Nextstrain. Lineages were also assigned to the genomes using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN) package [39] . The phylogenetic distribution of the lineages was visualized and annotated using iToL [40] ."

We compared the sample type (e.g. positive, pan-sarbeco, inconclusive, and negative) WGS output and calculated the percent of the genome covered, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and gain of detection rate.
