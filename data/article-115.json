In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages",

At present, the need for assays for rapid detection for diagnosis and surveillance, understanding the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus would be central for managing the spread of the epidemic [1, 2] . The advantage of quick sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome led to the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic assays that leveraged rapid identification of infected individuals to get fast medical support or quantization essential to both patient management and incidence tracking [3] . Identification of early imported cases in France helped to prevent immediate secondary transmission [4] . Singapore's enhanced surveillance and containment strategy also led to the suppressed expansion of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . On similar grounds, The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) have rapidly expanded their national surveillance system to combat SARS-CoV-2 [6] . Coupled with a highly accurate and high-throughput method of detection, this approach is expected to become more effective in dealing with COVID-19.",

These methods are majorly subdivided into antigen-antibody based serological assays, nucleic acid-based amplification assays, and sequencing-based assays. While serological assays are rapid detection tests, they have low sensitivity and specificity [7] . Nucleic acid-based amplification such as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been the gold standard in detection and diagnosis, but a negative RT-PCR does not eliminate the possibility of infection in clinically suspected cases [8] . Such results should be carefully interpreted to avoid false-negative reporting [9] . Moreover, these tests have been developed for diagnostic purposes and do not provide much information on the nature of the virus, its genetic information, and evolutionary pattern. In this regard, recently developed next-generation sequencing-based methods are potentially a good alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [10] .",

This led to other sequencing-based studies for detailed genomic characterization of the virus [12] . Combined genetic and epidemiological studies have been suggested to provide insights into the spread of the infection, evolutionary patterns, and genetic diversity of the virus, [1, 2] for effective management and preventive measures. Genomic surveillance coupled with agent-based modeling in Australia has been observed as an excellent approach to investigate and regulate COVID-19 transmission [13] . Towards these efforts, several openly available databases have also been developed such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) that facilitates rapid and open sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences [14] . Thus, along with detection, sequencing-based methods may also provide an added advantage of understanding the genetic epidemiology of the outbreak.",

Among these, 655 (87.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive on RT-PCR as per the diagnostic guidelines laid out by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). We included 19 samples that were RT-PCR negative (2.5%) and 43 samples (5.7%) were categorised as pan-sarbeco, since they were positive for the E gene primers only. E gene is conserved across all betacoronaviruses and its detection in the sample indicates the presence of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 or other bat-CoVs. A total of 35 samples (4.6%) were considered inconclusive as the samples had one of the two genes (i.e. ORF1ab gene) tested positive. In these samples, the E gene was tested negative hence these samples were termed inconclusive. Apart from this, the sequencing panel consisted of 8 COV-IDSeq Positive Control HT (CPC HT) and 8 no template control (NTC) as internal process controls making total samples to 768. The quality of the pooled library was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and fragment analyzer which showed the fragment size to be around 300bp. The panel was sequenced in technical duplicates making it a total of 1536 samples in total. The sequencing was performed for 36 cycles. The runtime of the sequencer was 11 hours. Sequencing generated a total of 705.64 Gb of data with 86.90% cluster passing filter and 95.62% above the quality cutoff of (QC) 30. Sequencing generated on an average of approximately 8.4 million reads for the 1,536 samples. The schematic of the COVIDSeq pipeline is depicted in Fig 1. The COVID-19 detection was performed using the DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test pipeline that implements SARS-CoV-2 detection criteria of at least 5 SARS-CoV-2 targets to be considered as positive. Out of the 1,504 samples, the DRAGEN COVIDSeq Test pipeline successfully annotated 1,352 samples. Further 136 samples were classified as undetected, and 16 failed the internal quality check. This corresponds to 676 unique samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected, 68 unique samples in which SARS-CoV2 was undetected, and 8 unique samples that failed the assay. There was no discordance in the annotations between any of the 752 sample duplicates considered, suggesting a cent percent concordance in the detection. The total runtime for the DRAGEN COVIDSeq pipeline was 374 minutes. The stepwise runtime is summarised in the S1 Table. All samples were also further considered for in-depth alignment and on average 8.4 million raw reads were generated for 1,536 samples, which were trimmed at base quality Q30 and read length of 30 bps that lead to an average of 7.9 million reads. The trimmed reads were further aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) and SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2). On average we found 2.4 million human reads with a mapping percentage of 30.73% and 5.04 million SARS-CoV-2 reads with a mapping percentages of 63.89% ",

For manual RNA extraction, a total of 140 \u03bcl of the VTM medium was used; prior to isolation, the VTM samples were subjected to heat inactivation at 50\u02daC for 30 minutes. After heat inactivation, the RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcl of VTM samples using QIAamp 1 Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the automated magnetic bead-based extraction method, 200 \u03bcl of VTM was transferred to a 96-well deep well cartridge plate supplied with the kit (VN143), and extraction was performed on Nextractor 1 NX-48S instrument (Genolution Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. After a bead-based capture and washing process, the RNA sample was eluted in 40 \u03bcl of the elution buffer. For RNA isolation using Trueprep AUTO v2 universal cartridge-based sample prep device, (Molbio Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd.) 500 \u03bcl of the VTM was added to the 2.5 ml of lysis buffer provided with the kit. After pipette mixing, 3 ml of the mixture was dispensed in the provided cartridge; the final RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of elution buffer. For RNA from TRIzol reagent, the tubes containing swabs were vortexed briefly. The overall content of the TRIzol tube was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube, followed by the addition of 200 \u03bcl of chloroform and mixed by inverting the tubes several times. After 5 minutes of incubation, the 1.5 ml tubes were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,000 RPM at 4\u02daC. The upper clear aqueous layer which contains the RNA was transferred to new tubes. An equal amount of isopropanol was added to the tubes containing the RNA. Contents of the tubes were mixed by inverting the tubes several times and tubes were incubated for 10 minutes on ice followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 RPM at 4\u02daC. The supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellet was dissolved in 30 \u03bcl of RNase-free water after 2 ethanol washes. TURBO DNase (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) treatment was given to the isolated RNA to remove genomic DNA contamination in the samples followed by RNA purification using the phenol/chloroform method.",

The primer pool additionally had primers targeting human RNA, producing an additional 11 amplicons. The PCR amplified product was later processed for tagmentation and adapter ligation using IDT for Illumina Nextera UD Indexes Set A, B, C, D (384 indexes, 384 samples). Further enrichment and cleanup was performed as per protocols provided by the manufacturer (Illumina Inc). All samples were processed as batches in a 96-well plate that consisted of one of COVIDSeq positive control HT (CPC HT) and one no template control (NTC); these 96 libraries were pooled together in a tube. Pooled samples were quantified using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen Inc.) and fragment sizes were analyzed in Agilent Fragment analyzer 5200 (Agilent Inc). The pooled library was further normalized to 4nM concentration and 25 \u03bcl of each normalized pool containing index adapter set A, B, C, and D were combined in a new microcentrifuge tube to a final concentration of 100pM and 120pM.
