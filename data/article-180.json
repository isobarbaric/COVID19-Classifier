            "text": "We used a regression model to examine the impact of influenza on death rates in tropical Singapore for the period 1996-2003. Influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant circulating influenza virus subtype, with consistently significant and robust effect on mortality rates. Influenza was associated with an annual death rate from all causes, from underlying pneumonia and influenza, and from underlying circulatory and respiratory conditions of 14.8 (95% confidence interval 9.8-19.8), 2.9 (1.0-5.0), and 11.9 (8.3-15.7) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. These results are comparable with observations in the United States and subtropical Hong Kong. An estimated 6.5% of underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths were attributable to influenza. The proportion of influenza-associated deaths was 11.3 times higher in persons age >65 years than in the general population. Our findings support the need for influenza surveillance and annual influenza vaccination for at-risk populations in tropical countries."

For influenza-associated underlying P&I deaths, the annual death rate in those >65 years (46.9/100,000) was 16.2 times higher than those in the general population (2.9/100,000) ( Table 5) . Table 6 compares the excess deaths observed in our study with that derived from studies in a subtropical and temperate country (6,7). While we observed a smaller overall impact for all ages than that reported in Hong Kong (6) and the United States (7), we noted a higher proportion of influenza-associated deaths among the elderly in Singapore."

Influenza vaccination for all persons age >65 years is a well-established recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) in the United States (22) . Vaccine coverage among elderly persons (>65 years) in the United States increased from 15% to 20% before 1980 to 65% in 2001 (23) , and the national target of 60% coverage in this population has been achieved since 1997 (24) . In Hong Kong, the use of vaccine has been limited (25) . However, the vaccine has been recommended for institutionalized elderly since 1997, and the Department of Health has had a program to vaccinate this population since 1998 (26) . In Singapore, influenza vaccine use has been low, and the mean annual quantity used in 2001-2002 was only \u224820,000 doses (Ministry of Health, Singapore, unpub. data). The number of persons age >65 averaged \u2248250,000 during that period (27) . Even if all 20,000 vac-cine doses had been given to this group of persons, vaccination coverage in the elderly would not have exceeded 8% per year."

Influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus subtype during our study period and had a consistently significant impact on all 3 categories of deaths. Although influenza B was noted to have significant effects on all-cause deaths and underlying C&R deaths, the magnitudes of RRs were relatively small (RR 1.00\u22121.01, for each 1% change in positive test results). In addition, influenza B virus did not have any significant and observable impact on underlying P&I deaths.

Influenza, in contrast, has caused an average of 588 excess deaths in Singapore annually. Influenza continues to cause an increasing amount of disease in Singapore, par-ticularly in our rapidly aging population. However, available strategies in influenza prevention and control have yet to be optimized, largely because the true impact of influenza has been masked by the lack of a clear seasonal pattern in the tropics.

The annual mean number of tests positive for influenza A was 5.8% (range 2.6%\u22129.5%) and for influenza B, 0.9% (range 0.4%\u2212 1.6%). Annually, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype in circulation. During the study period, peaks in influenza A (H3N2) were observed from December 1998 to January 1999 (the predominant circulating strain was A/Sydney/5/97), December 2000 to January 2001 (A/Moscow/10/99), December 2002 to January 2003 (A/Moscow/10/99), and October-November 2003 (A/Fujian/411/2002). Smaller peaks were noted in April\u2212July in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2002, and from September to November in 1999 and 2003. During the 8-year period, an annual mean of 15,616 deaths (range 15,301\u221216,024) occurred in Singapore. An average of 1,798 (range 1,545\u22122,340) underlying P&I deaths and 8,237 (range 7,833\u22128,715) underlying C&R deaths occurred each year (",

Influenza B also had a significant effect on underlying C&R deaths (RR 1.01 for each 1% change in positive test results, 95% CI 1.00\u22121.03, p = 0.037) and all-cause deaths (1.01, 1.00\u22121.02, p = 0.008), but not on underlying P&I deaths (p = 0.878). RSV had no observable impact on all 3 death categories analyzed (RR range 1.00\u22121.01 for each 10% change in positive test results, p>0.099) (Table 4). Next, we used the full model to quantify the excess deaths attributable to influenza throughout the year.
