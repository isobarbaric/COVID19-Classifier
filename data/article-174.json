            "text": "The study objective was to identify sociodemographic and coronavirus disease 2019 factors that are associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Eligible participants were 18 years or older and were diagnosed with cancer as an AYA (ages 15-39 years) and received services through an AYA cancer program. A total of 342 participants completed a cross-sectional survey. Our primary outcome-COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy-was surveyed as a 5-point Likert scale and operationalized as a binary outcome (agree vs hesitant). A large proportion of participants reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (37.1%). In the multivariable regression, female survivors (odds ratio \u00bc 1.81, 95% confidence interval \u00bc 1.10 to 2.98) and survivors with a high school education or less (odds ratio \u00bc 3.15, 95% confidence interval \u00bc 1.41 to 7.04) reported higher odds of vaccine hesitancy compared with their male or college graduate or higher counterparts. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy persists among AYA survivors despite their recommended priority vaccination status and higher chances of severe COVID-19 outcomes."

We conducted a survey of AYA cancer survivors to identify whether COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was common. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and diagnosed with cancer between ages 15 and 39 years and received services through the Huntsman Intermountain Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Care Program, which provides patient navigation to AYA survivors from 2 large health-care systems in Utah and surrounding Mountain West states. Participants gave informed consent and took part in a cross-sectional survey. Data collection occurred between October 2020 and January 2021 via e-mail, mail, and text.

Our primary outcome was a binary variable of vaccine hesitancy, defined as agree to vaccinate (agree or strongly agree) vs hesitant to vaccinate (neither agree nor disagree or disagree or strongly disagree) to indicate those who were undecided or unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine. We examined differences in vaccine hesitancy by sociodemographic (eg, age, treatment status, gender, education, race and ethnicity) and COVID-19 factors (eg, essential worker status, survey timing) using v 2 and Fisher exact tests or 2-sided t tests.

More than one-half of participants had received treatment since March 2020 (55.3%), were primarily female (61.1%) and non-Hispanic White (81.3%), and had at least some college education (55.4%; data not shown). Although 62.9% intended to get the vaccine, more than one-third (37.1%) expressed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Figure 1 ). Respondents surveyed after the Pfizer press release had statistically nonsignificant lower proportions of hesitancy than those surveyed earlier (30.0% vs 39.7%; P \u00bc .10), demonstrating a higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among AYA survivors compared with other studies of high-risk individuals (22% hesitant) (4). There were statistically significantly more female (41.6% vs 30.1% of male survivors; P \u00bc .03) and Hispanic (52.9% vs 31.6% of White and 20.0% of non-Hispanic other; P \u00bc .03) survivors who exhibited vaccine hesitancy (Supplementary Table 1 , available online). Table 1 shows female survivors had nearly 2 times higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (OR \u00bc 1.81, 95% CI \u00bc 1.10 to 2.98) than male survivors. In the existing literature, female gender is not associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (11); some reports indicate that women are more accepting of the vaccine than men (4). Hesitancy among female AYA survivors may be driven by COVID-19 vaccine misinformation asserting that the vaccine causes infertility (12, 13) . This finding demonstrates a need for sensitive communication on vaccination for female survivors and further inquiry into COVID-19 vaccine misinformation."

Lower educational attainment is associated with lower health literacy (14) , which may leave certain survivors susceptible to misunderstanding COVID-19 vaccine messaging. Further, inconsistent and sometimes contradictory US public health messaging has resulted in substantial confusion about COVID-19 among the general population (15) . Targeted education from cancer centers and oncology care teams to encourage equitable COVID-19 vaccination is needed for cancer survivors of all ages. Additionally, oncology care providers should encourage COVID-19 vaccination as such recommendations are the primary facilitator in uptake of other vaccines among AYA survivors (16) ."

We did not collect political affiliation, which has been associated with vaccine hesitancy (4) . Although reflective of the demographics of the region, our sample was homogenous precluding our ability to evaluate associations by race (4,11). The COVID-19 vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel to protect cancer survivors-a population vulnerable to poor COVID-19 outcomes. Yet vaccine hesitancy persists among AYA cancer survivors. Female survivors and survivors with low educational attainment demonstrated higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, highlighting an opportunity for targeted educational campaigns. Furthermore, oncology provider recommendations may have a substantial impact on COVID-19 vaccine uptake as seen in AYA survivor uptake of other vaccines."
