            "text": "Background: The ORF1ab of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS Corona Virus, SARS-CoV-2 genome is processed into 15 non-structural proteins, NSPs by proteases and each NSP has a specific role in the life cycle and pathogenicity of the virus. This research analyzes possible drugs for these proteins as targets in computational drug designing using already available experimental drugs from the drug bank database. Methods: Out of 471 proteins and 8820 drugs download from Protein Data Bank, PDB and Drug Bank database respectively, 16 proteins similar to NSP 1-15 and 31 drugs as per the \"Rule of three\" were selected for docking. Out of 88 docking results using PyRx, 18 proteins/chains with three promising drugs, DB01977, DB07132 and DB07535 were analyzed using PyMOL for final results. Results: NSPs 3, 5, 11, 14 and 15 were identified as targets for the drugs, DB01977, BD07132 and DB07535. Drugs, DB01977 and DB07535 bind in the same binding pockets of NSP 5 and NSP 15. Drug, DB07132 binds with more number of residues when compared with the other two drugs and this indicates that the strength of proteindrug association is more by this drug with the NSPs than other drugs. Binding pockets of NSPs for these three drugs are very close with many sharing residues in common suggesting of similarity of pharmacophore of these drugs with the target binding pockets. Conclusion: The binding pockets of NSPs are well matched with the pharmacophore of drugs and with polar surface of drugs less than or equal to 100 A 2 , drugs, DB01977, DB07132 and DB07535 bind individually and effectively with NSPs 3, 5, 11, 14 and 15 of ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 genome to bring changes in the activity of SARS-CoV-2 which may be useful for biological and clinical considerations."

The translated polypeptides of ORF 1 ab are processed into approximately 1-15 NSPs [1] . NSP 1 is used by the virus to evade the host immune system, inhibition of host gene expression [2, 3] and hence, it is a target protein for vaccine development. NSP 2 is dispensable for viral replication and its function is not well clear [4] . NSPs 2 and 3 interact to form proteases that cleave ORF1ab [5] . The structure of NSP 3 shows the presence of RNA-binding domains [6] , SARS Unique Domain, SUD [7] which in turn has three sub domains, N-terminal, Middle and C-terminal domains [8] and papain like protease, PL-PRO domain to achieve full activity of the protein [9] . NSP 3 and NSP 4 interact with other cofactors to induce membrane rearrangement for the mechanism of viral replication and the loss of NSP 3-NSP 4 complex eliminates viral replication [10] . NSP 5 is a cystine like protease, 3CL-PRO which processes 11 cleavage sites between NSP 4 and 16 during replication and also has a conserved 3-domain structure and catalytic residues [11] [12] [13] . NSP 6 generates autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in autophagy [14, 15] . Moreover, different NSPs have different roles in virus life cycle. For example, NSP 12 in complex with NSP7 and NSP 8 forms viral replicase machinery [16] [17] [18] [19] , NSP 9 in complex with NSP 8 is involved in RNA replication and virulence [20] [21] [22] , NSP10 -NSP16 complex is essential for capping viral mRNA transcripts for efficient translation and to evade immune surveillance [23] , NSP 14 in complex with its activator NSP 10 is involved in exonuclease activity [24, 25] , NSP13 is for RNA TPase activity [26] , NSP14 is for exoribonuclease activity [27, 28] , NSP 11 and NSP 15 are involved in endoribonuclease activity [29] [30] [31] etc. table R1."

Although most of the NSPs are orthologous, coronavirus NSP 2 is homologous to the bacterial DNA Topoisomerase I and IV needed for (\u2212 ) strand RNA synthesis which suggests that NSP 2 is considered as target for drug and vaccine development [34] . [29] [30] [31] Since the progress of development of vaccine/drug has been highlighted by many research and review articles, this effort is unique to the additionally existing/ongoing drug discoveries because of the rule of three [45] which emphasizes on fragment based drug designing. Knowing the pandemic nature of the disease and unavailability of the vaccine/drug, the docking was undertaken from the existing drugs from drug bank which were in an experimental stage and selected the drugs based on the rule of three [45] . The drugs obtained were having the polar surface area less than or equal to 100 A 2 instead, using the rule of five [46] , the selected drugs would be of higher molecular weight, polar surface area etc. which were already under drug discovery."

PyMOL is an open source molecular visualization software created by Warren Lyford DeLano and commercialized by Schr\u00f6dinger. PyMOL can produce high quality 3D images for structural biology. PyMOL can be obtained from https://www.schrodinger.com/p ymol. PyRx is virtual screening software for computational drug designing to screen libraries of compounds against drug targets. PyRx includes docking wizard with easy-to-use user interface which makes it a valuable tool for Computer-Aided Drug Design. PyRx also includes chemical spreadsheet-like functionality and powerful visualization engine that are essential for Rational Drug Design. PyRx is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrx/files. For every docking, a docking parameter file is created which tells AutoDock which docking algorithm to use and how many runs to do and it usually has the file extension, \". dpf\", docking parameter file. Moreover, the parameter file has details of receptors, ligands, exhaustiveness, grid details etc. and if there are no grid parameter, default grid parameters based on binding pockets were taken for docking by PyRx. Calculation of binding score or energy or affinity is completely based on the pharmacophores of ligand and receptors and mathematical expressions of the same can be found from the articles [47, 48] even though explanation of mathematical derivation is beyond the scope of this paper. BaseByBase is a whole genome pairwise and multiple alignment editor. The program highlights differences between pairs of alignments and allows the user to easily "

Although many research and reviews state about the ideal sequence similarity from 30% to 40% [50] , the selected proteins here are above 88% sequence similarity due to selected RMSD around 0.5 and this cut off is to minimize the structural deviation from the predicted structure. Moreover, this was to get enough number of proteins for each NSP, Table 1 and as aimed, we had downloaded highly similar proteins from PDB for NSPs 3, 5, 10, 11, 14 and 15. The NSPs have different roles in virus life cycle such as PL PRO, 3CL PRO, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp, endonucleases etc. This screening and selection make it worth docking to reduce the differences in the dry and wet lab experiments and the false positive error. Like in this research, these NSPs are already on the targets for drug designing [51, 52] ."

For the difference in binding pockets with different chains of proteins, a special analysis was done with respect to binding residues and bond length in each chain of the same protein, Table 5 . This establishes the fact that the drugs mostly bind with binding pockets situated between the chains rather than the binding pockets of individual chain, Fig. 1 . Like in this research, the proteins, NSP 3, Papain-Like Protease, PL-PRO and NSP 5, 3C-like protease, 3CL-PRO are targets for drug discovery in other studies [53] also. This drug discovery is because of their important functions, ORF1ab is processed by proteases, PL-PRO and 3CL-PRO into replication complexes of positive-stranded RNA viruses and stored in double membrane vehicles in the cytoplasm which are essential for viral RNA replication [54, 55] ."

Drugs DB01977 and DB07535 have same binding pockets of NSPs 5 and 15 which highlights the matching pharmacophore of drug and the binding pockets. Additionally, we analyzed different poses of three drugs with the NSPs for their very close pockets and sharing binding residues. It was found that the poses of two drugs, DB07535 and DB07132 overlap in their binding pockets such that their effect may or may not be exhibited completely in a bound state. This is the case with the clinicians administering different drugs at a time such that drugs may have same binding pockets with clashing their conformation to exhibit different effect or no effect of each drug, Fig. 2 . However, the binding poses of the drugs, DB01977 and DB07535/DB07132 are different in protein, 6wuu.pdb, Fig. 2 which may be having the effect of each drug. Moreover, when a drug is administered, as per this research, each of the three drugs may bind considerably with all NSPs 3, 5, 11, 14 and 15 or may be along with other NSPs at a time to bring biological and clinical effects on the virus life cycle. Furthermore, we compared the pharmacophore of some well-known (see Table 6 ) drugs with these three drugs using Molinspiration online software, Table 6 and analyzed bioactivity of these drugs, Table 7 using the same software along with their structures, Fig. 3 (a) , (b) & (c). The well-known drugs have high volume and molecular weight which may or may not bind easily with variable binding pockets of NSPs to bring biological effect. The score in each drug in Table 7 shows that these drugs are positive potential drugs as protease inhibitor, kinase inhibitor etc."
