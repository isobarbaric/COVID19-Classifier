If adequate FTOCC history and RT-PCR test cannot be acquired for emergency, all urgent cases should be considered as \"COVID-19 positive\" for infection control, whose procedures should be accomplished in the negative pressure room. Ideally, RT-PCR test should be done within 2 days before procedure for reducing the infection risk between the test and procedure. During local outbreak, we added the \"residence place triage\" (green arrow): procedures of patients from intermediate or high-risk areas would be postponed except for urgent ones. Risk for different areas was declared by the local Municipal Health Commission.
