            "text": "Since 1988, when World Health Organization (WHO) Member States and partners launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases has declined from 350,000 in 125 countries to 176 in only two countries in 2019 (1) . The Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared two of the three WPV types, type 2 (WPV2) and type 3 (WPV3), eradicated globally in 2015 and 2019, respectively (1) . Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (1) . Containment under strict biorisk management measures is vital to prevent reintroduction of eradicated polioviruses into communities from poliovirus facilities. In 2015, Member States committed to contain type 2 polioviruses (PV2) in poliovirus-essential facilities (PEFs) certified in accordance with a global standard (2) . Member states agreed to report national PV2 inventories annually, destroy unneeded PV2 materials, and, if retaining PV2 materials, establish national authorities for containment (NACs) and a PEF auditing process. Since declaration of WPV3 eradication in October 2019, these activities are also required with WPV3 materials. Despite challenges faced during 2019-2020, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the global poliovirus containment program continues to work toward important milestones. To maintain progress, all WHO Member States are urged to adhere to the agreed containment resolutions, including officially establishing legally empowered NACs and submission of PEF Certificates of Participation.",

            "text": "The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has achieved its progress through extensive use of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV, which consists of live, attenuated Sabin vaccine strain types 1, 2, and 3). Despite the substantial advancement toward eradication attained using this vaccine, in areas with low population immunity, prolonged transmission of Sabin vaccine virus can lead to viral mutations that result in development of neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) (1). Outbreaks can result from VDPVs that are transmitted in a community and are known as circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs). Since the majority of cVDPV outbreaks were caused by the type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine strain (OPV2), a coordinated global switch in vaccines was conducted in 2016, replacing the use of tOPV with bivalent OPV (bOPV, which consists of Sabin strain types 1 and 3) (3). PV2 disease immunity in the community was to be provided by high coverage with tOPV before the switch as well as a recommended single dose of injectable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to help protect against paralysis; however, suboptimal vaccination coverage and IPV manufacturing shortages have led to substantial PV2 immunity gaps in many countries (4) . Since the switch, many countries, particularly in Africa, have experienced cVDPV2 outbreaks (1) . To combat these outbreaks, vaccination responses with monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2) have been implemented in approximately two dozen countries. However, waning type 2 immunity and delayed and low-quality outbreak responses have resulted in spread of existing outbreaks and emergence of new cVDPV2 outbreaks, leading to a significant increase in areas affected by cVDPV2 across parts of Africa and Asia (5) . A novel OPV type 2, (nOPV2) engineered to be more genetically stable to prevent seeding of cVDPV2 outbreaks, is expected to be available for initial use in cVDPV2 outbreak response vaccination campaigns in October 2020 under WHO's Emergency Use Listing (5).",
