The infection is asymptomatic in some individuals, while in others, it causes symptoms ranging from dry cough and dyspnea to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and leading to death in severe cases. 4, 5 To date, a number of studies have investigated the predictors of disease severity in COVID-19. Nevertheless, the sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence this disease course have not been fully defined.
