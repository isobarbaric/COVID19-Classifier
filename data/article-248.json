It consists of physical screening (PS) of large libraries of chemicals against one or more specific biological targets. Virtual screening (VS) is a strategy for in silico evaluation of chemical libraries for a given target, and can be integrated to focus the PS process. The present work addresses the integration of both PS and VS, respectively."

In fact, VS is emerging as a key strategy to help filter out those compounds with poor potency, and biological or pharmacological properties [6] [7] [8] .

The last column indicates the original references. Table 1 reveals the VS workflow used in most of the studies: (i) preliminary filtering of a virtual library (tens to hundreds of thousands of compounds) using various criteria (e.g. Lipinski's rule of five); (ii) homology and pharmacophore modeling; combined with (iii) docking and scoring of the protein-ligand complexes. For PS methods, assays that are particular to each specific target were applied, most of them being based on fluorescence detection. The outcome of these studies indicates that preliminary VS not only drastically reduces the number of chemicals that are physically screened, but also increases the hit rates."

Knowing the structure of the biological target macromolecule offers many advantages in comparison with the situation where only information about the geometry of a bioactive (reference) ligand is available. When structural information about the target is available from either fact or inference, we consider this target-based, or structure-based, virtual screening (TBVS). All other cases represent ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS), where the reference compound(s) are known substrates, inhibitors, agonists or antagonists, among others. An important issue in target selection is the druggability of the molecule under consideration, and whether the target is amenable to therapeutic intervention via small molecules. One approach is to assess whether members from the same gene family show similar binding affinity towards drug-like ligands with related physicochemical properties [16] ; the other approach is sometimes referred as 'target fishing' (see J. L. Jenkins, this issue)."

LBVS methods start from known bioactives, which can be inhibitors or activators. Similarity search [27] and classification [28] methods can be used to select novel scaffolds (see K. V. Balakin, this issue). Filtering can be applied (i) forward or (ii) backward to the hits obtained in the VS campaign. In forward filtering [29] , the selection criteria are used to reduce the size of the initial library, that is from several millions to several hundreds or hundreds of test compounds further to be docked. The backward procedure uses filtering criteria to prioritize candidates for PS during post-HTS analysis [30] ."

However, if VS technologies can reduce the library size to 10's or 100's of compounds, many of these constraints are lifted allowing the use of more physiologically relevant or complex assays, potentially including whole animal-based assays, which are recognized as a viable alternative in today's search for novel pharmaceuticals. Another issue related to assay implementation is the selection of in vitro vs. in vivo assays. Many of the initial hits in enzyme/protein-based in vitro assays may fail at the cellular or animal level due to stability or metabolism issues. However, with the development of VS and post-HTS analysis methods, this can be minimized. Finally, assay selection has a strong influence on the outcome of the physical screen. For example, the use of a simple binding assay screen can yield both agonists and antagonists of target activity. If only agonists are desired, a functional assay based on target activity might be preferentially selected."

Scientifically, one can reduce the search space to rapidly find a solution; economically, one is no longer required to screen millions of compounds physically, before identifying hits. Negative aspects of this integration effort are of theoretical and practical nature. Theoretically, the streamlining of PS may result in testing the wrong library subset. This relates to both the limitation of theoretical methods, and to the inappropriate use of VS technologies. Practically speaking, it is possible that the entire effort leads to naught; in this case, doubt is typically cast over in silico approaches, although experimental techniques are not without flaw either. Continuous information exchange and effective team communication, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , will avoid such negative situations."

Chemotype evaluation is used to rank families of HTS hits, and is further applied to (ii) Individual molecule evaluation: Our scheme gives higher priority (a) to molecules that are in the desired physico-chemical property range (using methods to compute, e.g. solubility and permeability); (b) to molecules that have high(er) activity, compared to those that are less active.
