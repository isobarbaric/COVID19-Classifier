            "text": "High-throughput screening (HTS) represents the dominant technique for the identification of new lead compounds in current drug discovery. It consists of physical screening (PS) of large libraries of chemicals against one or more specific biological targets. Virtual screening (VS) is a strategy for in silico evaluation of chemical libraries for a given target, and can be integrated to focus the PS process. The present work addresses the integration of both PS and VS, respectively."

Typical virtual screening (VS) methods involve, for example, filtering of libraries for compounds containing toxic, reactive, or otherwise undesirable groups, or, by contrast, the search for molecules with preferred lead-or drug-like properties and desired activity [5] . In fact, VS is emerging as a key strategy to help filter out those compounds with poor potency, and biological or pharmacological properties [6] [7] [8] . Recent reviews suggest that while VS is often presented as an alternative to PS, both strategies are highly complementary [5, 9] ."

Knowing the structure of the biological target macromolecule offers many advantages in comparison with the situation where only information about the geometry of a bioactive (reference) ligand is available. When structural information about the target is available from either fact or inference, we consider this target-based, or structure-based, virtual screening (TBVS). All other cases represent ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS), where the reference compound(s) are known substrates, inhibitors, agonists or antagonists, among others. An important issue in target selection is the druggability of the molecule under consideration, and whether the target is amenable to therapeutic intervention via small molecules. One approach is to assess whether members from the same gene family show similar binding affinity towards drug-like ligands with related physicochemical properties [16] ; the other approach is sometimes referred as 'target fishing' (see J. L. Jenkins, this issue)."

However, if VS technologies can reduce the library size to 10's or 100's of compounds, many of these constraints are lifted allowing the use of more physiologically relevant or complex assays, potentially including whole animal-based assays, which are recognized as a viable alternative in today's search for novel pharmaceuticals. Another issue related to assay implementation is the selection of in vitro vs. in vivo assays. Many of the initial hits in enzyme/protein-based in vitro assays may fail at the cellular or animal level due to stability or metabolism issues. However, with the development of VS and post-HTS analysis methods, this can be minimized. Finally, assay selection has a strong influence on the outcome of the physical screen. For example, the use of a simple binding assay screen can yield both agonists and antagonists of target activity. If only agonists are desired, a functional assay based on target activity might be preferentially selected."

The issue of what molecules to select for dose-response confirmation is often left with the medicinal chemist or the biologist, and requires cheminformatics support. In our center, we apply the following post-HTS prioritization scheme [30] for chemotype as well as individual molecule evaluation (See Box 1)."

It should be applied only to confirmed hits, both at the structure and purity, as well as at the dose-response level. The final score captures information related not only to actives, but also inactives from the same chemical family, while the intellectual property and toxicity evaluation schemes are aimed at encoding information related to individual chemotypes. At the individual molecule level, the use of estimated physico-chemical properties can assist the final prioritization score."

Scientifically, one can reduce the search space to rapidly find a solution; economically, one is no longer required to screen millions of compounds physically, before identifying hits. Negative aspects of this integration effort are of theoretical and practical nature. Theoretically, the streamlining of PS may result in testing the wrong library subset. This relates to both the limitation of theoretical methods, and to the inappropriate use of VS technologies. Practically speaking, it is possible that the entire effort leads to naught; in this case, doubt is typically cast over in silico approaches, although experimental techniques are not without flaw either. Continuous information exchange and effective team communication, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , will avoid such negative situations."

Evaluation criteria to select molecules for chemistry follow-up (i) Chemotype evaluation: This criterion gives higher priority (a) to chemotypes that occur more in active compounds, compared to the overall number of tested chemotypes; (b) to chemotypes that are absent or less present in patents, disclosures and medicinal chemistry (for intellectual property reasons); and (c) to chemotypes that are generally regarded as safe, or are less frequent in toxicity databases. Chemotype evaluation is used to rank families of HTS hits, and is further applied to (ii) Individual molecule evaluation: Our scheme gives higher priority (a) to molecules that are in the desired physico-chemical property range (using methods to compute, e.g. solubility and permeability); (b) to molecules that have high(er) activity, compared to those that are less active. To the above, (c) we add the chemotype score computed earlier, for a final composite score that ranks all confirmed or presumed actives."
