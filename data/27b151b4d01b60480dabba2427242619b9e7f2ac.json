Subjects and methods This study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009-2019. Results All clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients' associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity. Conclusion FSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases. Ophthalmic examination can carry a risk of re-traumatisation of individuals who have experienced FSG in a context of torture. 1234567890();,:",

In addition, from a medicolegal point of view, the non-ophthalmic aspects (such as skin scarring and psychiatric diagnoses) may represent the principal part of the legal submission.

In more extreme forms of response, the inadvertent reminder to the client of his or her mistreatment may precipitate an episode of \"dissociation\", in which he or she may appear to become vacant and detached from their surroundings, and need to be re-orientated gently and patiently in time and place. This can be disconcerting for clinicians who are not familiar with the phenomenon, and are unprepared to deal with it. Clearly, it is important that all these manifestations of severe mental trauma are recognised and not simply labelled as poor compliance with examination. It is equally important that patients who exhibit such avoidance behaviour and in whom PTSD is suspected are referred to their GP for specialist assessment and treatment. If the potential for re-traumatisation is suspected, it is vital to minimise distress by limiting, or even discontinuing the clinical examination. Obviously, care should be taken that ",

As there may be few residual clinical ophthalmic signs of this form of torture when a period of time has elapsed, it may be necessary to undertake retinal imaging studies. The patient may appear to have difficulty complying with the clinical examination, which should be modified or discontinued if the he or she experiences signs of distress. This should be recognised as a feature of the patient's mental trauma, and ophthalmologists should ensure that the patient is receiving appropriate psychological assessment and support.",
