            "text": "Increasing evidence indicates that specific genetic variants influence the severity of outcomes after infection with COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether the effect of these genetic factors is independent of the risk due to more established non-genetic demographic and metabolic risk factors such as male sex, poor cardiometabolic health, and low socioeconomic status. We sought to identify interactions between genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors influencing COVID-19 severity via a genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank. Of 378,051 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, 2,402 were classified as having experienced severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Exposures included sex, cardiometabolic risk factors [obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), tested jointly], and multiple deprivation index. Multiplicative interaction was tested using a logistic regression model, conducting both an interaction test and a joint test of genetic main and interaction effects. Five independent variants reached genome-wide significance in the joint test, one of which also reached significance in the interaction test. One of these, rs2268616 in the placental growth factor (PGF) gene, showed stronger effects in males and in individuals with T2D. None of the five variants showed effects on a similarly-defined phenotype in a lookup in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. These results reveal potential additional genetic loci contributing to COVID-19 severity and demonstrate the value of including non-genetic risk factors in an interaction testing approach for genetic discovery."

Several loci were further associated with interstitial lung disease and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, possibly predisposing individuals to greater immune response and worse outcomes.

We sought to understand the interactions between genetic variants and previously reported risk factors, in order to gain novel understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting COVID-19 severity and add an important dimension to the current epidemiological literature on COVID-19. We undertook a series of three genome-wide gene-environment interaction studies in the United Kingdom Biobank, conducting both interaction effect tests, to find genetic impacts on the risk factor-severe disease relationship, and joint tests of genetic main and interaction effects, to discover new genetic loci while accounting for heterogeneity due to risk factor interactions. The \"environmental\" exposures included sex, CM health (obesity and type 2 diabetes status), and social determinants of health (as quantified by the multiple deprivation index). The binary outcome was severe COVID-19 (as defined by hospitalization or death due to while the rest of the population was used as a control group. Using GxE analyses and GWAS postprocessing methods, we found 5 genome-wide significant loci that provide insight into the biological mechanisms of severe COVID-19 outcomes."

COVID-19 test results were downloaded from the UKBB data portal on January 1, 2020 including all diagnostics available since April 2020, when the test results became publicly available. The severe COVID-19 phenotype for was defined as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection plus hospitalized COVID-19, with the rest of the population serving as controls versus the rest of the population.

BMI and T2D were tested jointly, and then individually as a sensitivity analysis. The multiple deprivation index (MDI) was used as a measure of social determinants of health (SDH). The MDI is composed of metrics including economic stability, physical environment, and education; details can be found at https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/label.cgi?id 76. The MDI is a measure of relative deprivation for small areas (or neighbourhoods) in England. The MDI ranks every small area in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area). Deprivation \"deciles\" and percentages are published alongside ranks; percentages were used in this study. Na\u00efve collation of these indices across UK countries can be problematic since the scores are constructed differently. So, for the MDI analyses, only the subset of the population living in England was used in order to reduce heterogeneity. We note that this still retains a majority of the population in question (86%)."

This analysis tests the hypothesis that the genetic association signal (here, of genetic interaction) shares a common causal variant with the eQTL at that locus, which increases confidence that the associated expression effect could be mediating the genetic effect.

            "text": "Exploring the interplay of genetics and sex offers novel understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting COVID-19 severity and adds an important dimension to the current epidemiological literature on COVID-19. In this genomewide gene-environment interaction analysis, we found five significant genomic regions (p < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) that interact with well-established risk factors to influence COVID-19 severity. Sex-dimorphic transcripts and hormones, as well as differences in environmental factors between the sexes, contribute to differential immune responses between sexes (Klein and Flanagan, 2016) and may mediate the established association of male sex with greater COVID-19 severity. In our analysis, rs2268616 was statistically significant in the joint analyses for sex and CM diseases (p < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). This variant has been associated with testosterone and placental growth factor gene in GWAS analyses, suggesting that this variant interacts with sex to mediate worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interestingly, this variant is also an eQTL for EIF2B2, a gene within a family of proteins that mediate viral mRNA translation. Moreover, prior studies have found an increased risk of death and significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers in male COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients compared with women (Lau et al., 2021) . The EIF2B2 variant is linked to a strong transcription chromatin state in the cells of the lung, spleen, and B-cells, perhaps mediating the robust inflammatory response in males that is associated with worse COVID outcomes. Furthermore, rs2268616 sits within an enhancer in lung tissue, suggesting a role of this variant on transcription and respiratory complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Variant rs2268616 also shows a modest positive association with coronary artery disease and negative association with HOMA-B based on lookups in the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/), indicating a potential influence on metabolic traits in general. Our findings suggest that this genetic variant may modify the relationship between biological differences and associated worse COVID-19 outcomes primarily through regulating viral RNA clearance immune response and lung cell transcription."

            "text": "Comorbidities associated with CM health such as obesity and T2D have been implicated in mediating worse COVID-19 outcomes (Ritter et al., 2020) . Our findings show four variants that were genome-wide significant in our CM joint tests: rs182113773, rs11115199, rs148793499, and rs2268616. Located within the intron for MACC1, a gene associated with BMI-adjusted waist circumference and BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio, rs182113773 is an enhancer within neutrophils, monocytes, and B cells. This variant also has high gene expression in EBVtransformed lymphocytes and is a likely regulatory variant (RegulomeDB score of 0.59), which further suggests that the interaction of this variant with CM health has a regulatory role on immune response. Studies found that increased neutrophil count in T2D groups are associated with clinical severity and may mediate the positive association between T2D and COVID-19 severity (Zhu et al., 2020) . Thus, this MACC1 variant may be interacting with CM health to mediate greater COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, obese adipose tissues overexpress receptors and proteases that enable the entry of SARS-CoV-2, possibly contributing to the severe inflammation and immune response of individuals with obesity (Ritter et al., 2020) . Alongside decreased immune response mediated by testosterone, rs2268616 may also play a role in the deflated immune response seen in cases with CM disease status. This variant has a positive association with coronary artery disease and a negative association with HOMA-B (a method that assesses \u03b2-cell function from basal fasting glucose and insulin). For CM diseases, well controlled blood glucose and smaller glycemic variability have been associated with lower mortality during hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Zhu et al., 2020) . Therefore, this variant may help explain the COVID-19 biology that increases the risk for individuals with T2D. Interactions between these genetic factors and deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and other comorbidities of obesity and T2D may be placing individuals at greater risk for worse outcomes of COVID-19."

Thus, this locus may instead modify immune response via interactions with obesity.

By subsetting our dataset to individuals of European ancestry, we reduce the heterogeneity but face a limited sample size. Nonetheless, the use of interaction analysis allowed us to uncover novel variants: the GEM marginal p-value did not pass the genome-wide significance threshold for three of the five variants, meaning that these variants would not have been detected via a standard GWAS in this population."
