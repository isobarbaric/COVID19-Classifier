            "text": "Increasing evidence indicates that specific genetic variants influence the severity of outcomes after infection with COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether the effect of these genetic factors is independent of the risk due to more established non-genetic demographic and metabolic risk factors such as male sex, poor cardiometabolic health, and low socioeconomic status. We sought to identify interactions between genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors influencing COVID-19 severity via a genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank. Of 378,051 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, 2,402 were classified as having experienced severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Exposures included sex, cardiometabolic risk factors [obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), tested jointly], and multiple deprivation index. Multiplicative interaction was tested using a logistic regression model, conducting both an interaction test and a joint test of genetic main and interaction effects. Five independent variants reached genome-wide significance in the joint test, one of which also reached significance in the interaction test. One of these, rs2268616 in the placental growth factor (PGF) gene, showed stronger effects in males and in individuals with T2D. None of the five variants showed effects on a similarly-defined phenotype in a lookup in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. These results reveal potential additional genetic loci contributing to COVID-19 severity and demonstrate the value of including non-genetic risk factors in an interaction testing approach for genetic discovery."

Male sex is independently associated with higher mortality and worse COVID-19 outcomes (Palaiodimos et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020) . Cardiometabolic (CM) conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, are also associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity (Barron et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Additionally, associated comorbidities of obesity, such as deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and compromised cilia on airway epithelial cells may put individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19 (Ritter et al., 2020) . Minoritized communities are disproportionately impacted by of COVID-19 and may be predisposed to worse conditions due to environmental factors, limited healthcare access, and other societal factors (Tai et al., 2021) . Furthermore, housing and neighborhood density and increased work-related exposure may put low-income groups at higher risk (Burstr\u00f6m and Tao, 2020) . Additionally, the greater prevalence of underlying chronic conditions among individuals with lower socioeconomic status puts this group at greater risk of severe outcomes."

The HGI global meta-analysis identified 13 genome-wide significant loci, 9 of which were associated with increased risk of severe symptoms for hospitalized COVID (Niemi et al., 2021) . Several loci were further associated with interstitial lung disease and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, possibly predisposing individuals to greater immune response and worse outcomes. Genetic studies have also been helpful in clarifying the causal impacts of highly-correlated body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic risk factors on COVID-19 severity (Leong et al., 2021) ."

We sought to understand the interactions between genetic variants and previously reported risk factors, in order to gain novel understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting COVID-19 severity and add an important dimension to the current epidemiological literature on COVID-19. We undertook a series of three genome-wide gene-environment interaction studies in the United Kingdom Biobank, conducting both interaction effect tests, to find genetic impacts on the risk factor-severe disease relationship, and joint tests of genetic main and interaction effects, to discover new genetic loci while accounting for heterogeneity due to risk factor interactions. The \"environmental\" exposures included sex, CM health (obesity and type 2 diabetes status), and social determinants of health (as quantified by the multiple deprivation index). The binary outcome was severe COVID-19 (as defined by hospitalization or death due to while the rest of the population was used as a control group. Using GxE analyses and GWAS postprocessing methods, we found 5 genome-wide significant loci that provide insight into the biological mechanisms of severe COVID-19 outcomes."

Sample sizes varied depending on available phenotypes across these populations. COVID-19 test results were downloaded from the UKBB data portal on January 1, 2020 including all diagnostics available since April 2020, when the test results became publicly available. The severe COVID-19 phenotype for was defined as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection plus hospitalized COVID-19, with the rest of the population serving as controls versus the rest of the population. This definition was designed to mirror that of the \"B2\" phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative team (Niemi et al., 2021 ) (COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2020 and is outlined in Supplementary Figure S1 .

BMI and T2D were tested jointly, and then individually as a sensitivity analysis. The multiple deprivation index (MDI) was used as a measure of social determinants of health (SDH). The MDI is composed of metrics including economic stability, physical environment, and education; details can be found at https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/label.cgi?id 76. The MDI is a measure of relative deprivation for small areas (or neighbourhoods) in England. The MDI ranks every small area in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area). Deprivation \"deciles\" and percentages are published alongside ranks; percentages were used in this study. Na\u00efve collation of these indices across UK countries can be problematic since the scores are constructed differently. So, for the MDI analyses, only the subset of the population living in England was used in order to reduce heterogeneity.

Two of these variants (rs148793499, rs11115199) passed a study-wide significance threshold (p < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 /3 exposures 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). No variants passed the GWS threshold in the MDI analysis. Of the five variants, a GWS marginal effect (i.e., from the identical statistical model but excluding the interaction term) was identified for only rs2268616 (p 1.08 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) and rs182113773 (p 1.39 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). This result shows that the joint test discovered variants that would not have been found via a standard GWAS in this population."

This variant sits in an intron of the placental growth factor (PGF) gene and is modestly associated with testosterone in GWAS analyses (Prins et al., 2017) . It is also a putative enhancer in lung and other tissues, and is an eQTL for EIF2B2 (a gene in a family of proteins that regulate viral mRNA translation) in whole blood. However, colocalization analysis using whole blood eQTL statistics from eQTLGen Consortium did not support the hypothesis of a shared causal variant with either PGF or EIF2B (posterior probabilities <0.1%). Figure 2 . T2D-stratified tests also showed a greater genetic effect on severe COVID-19 in individuals with T2D (OR 2.01 [1.22-3.32]) compared to those without T2D (OR 1.6 [1.33-1.9)."

            "text": "Exploring the interplay of genetics and sex offers novel understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting COVID-19 severity and adds an important dimension to the current epidemiological literature on COVID-19. In this genomewide gene-environment interaction analysis, we found five significant genomic regions (p < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) that interact with well-established risk factors to influence COVID-19 severity. Sex-dimorphic transcripts and hormones, as well as differences in environmental factors between the sexes, contribute to differential immune responses between sexes (Klein and Flanagan, 2016) and may mediate the established association of male sex with greater COVID-19 severity. In our analysis, rs2268616 was statistically significant in the joint analyses for sex and CM diseases (p < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). This variant has been associated with testosterone and placental growth factor gene in GWAS analyses, suggesting that this variant interacts with sex to mediate worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interestingly, this variant is also an eQTL for EIF2B2, a gene within a family of proteins that mediate viral mRNA translation. Moreover, prior studies have found an increased risk of death and significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers in male COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients compared with women (Lau et al., 2021) . The EIF2B2 variant is linked to a strong transcription chromatin state in the cells of the lung, spleen, and B-cells, perhaps mediating the robust inflammatory response in males that is associated with worse COVID outcomes. Furthermore, rs2268616 sits within an enhancer in lung tissue, suggesting a role of this variant on transcription and respiratory complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Variant rs2268616 also shows a modest positive association with coronary artery disease and negative association with HOMA-B based on lookups in the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/), indicating a potential influence on metabolic traits in general. Our findings suggest that this genetic variant may modify the relationship between biological differences and associated worse COVID-19 outcomes primarily through regulating viral RNA clearance immune response and lung cell transcription."

            "text": "Comorbidities associated with CM health such as obesity and T2D have been implicated in mediating worse COVID-19 outcomes (Ritter et al., 2020) . Our findings show four variants that were genome-wide significant in our CM joint tests: rs182113773, rs11115199, rs148793499, and rs2268616. Located within the intron for MACC1, a gene associated with BMI-adjusted waist circumference and BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio, rs182113773 is an enhancer within neutrophils, monocytes, and B cells. This variant also has high gene expression in EBVtransformed lymphocytes and is a likely regulatory variant (RegulomeDB score of 0.59), which further suggests that the interaction of this variant with CM health has a regulatory role on immune response. Studies found that increased neutrophil count in T2D groups are associated with clinical severity and may mediate the positive association between T2D and COVID-19 severity (Zhu et al., 2020) . Thus, this MACC1 variant may be interacting with CM health to mediate greater COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, obese adipose tissues overexpress receptors and proteases that enable the entry of SARS-CoV-2, possibly contributing to the severe inflammation and immune response of individuals with obesity (Ritter et al., 2020) . Alongside decreased immune response mediated by testosterone, rs2268616 may also play a role in the deflated immune response seen in cases with CM disease status. This variant has a positive association with coronary artery disease and a negative association with HOMA-B (a method that assesses \u03b2-cell function from basal fasting glucose and insulin). For CM diseases, well controlled blood glucose and smaller glycemic variability have been associated with lower mortality during hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Zhu et al., 2020) . Therefore, this variant may help explain the COVID-19 biology that increases the risk for individuals with T2D. Interactions between these genetic factors and deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and other comorbidities of obesity and T2D may be placing individuals at greater risk for worse outcomes of COVID-19."

The rs11115199 variant is an eQTL for METTL25, a gene that has known genetic links to BMI but which has minimal transcription in memory T cells and B cells. Thus, this locus may instead modify immune response via interactions with obesity. Meanwhile, the genetic effect of rs148793499 appears to be most directly modulated by metabolic status; in stratified CM tests, the variant showed strong effects in individuals with T2D but no major differences in effect in individuals with obesity."

We subsetted our sample to participants from England to reduce heterogeneity, but this reduced the sample size (by 16.5%; 2,007 vs. 2,402 cases) and thus statistical power available for the MDI analysis. Additionally, there may simply be little signal to uncover: the effects of genetics and social determinants of health on COVID-19 severity may be approximately independent."

By subsetting our dataset to individuals of European ancestry, we reduce the heterogeneity but face a limited sample size. Nonetheless, the use of interaction analysis allowed us to uncover novel variants: the GEM marginal p-value did not pass the genome-wide significance threshold for three of the five variants, meaning that these variants would not have been detected via a standard GWAS in this population."
