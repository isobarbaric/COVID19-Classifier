Comparison of COVID-19 patient groups with increasing severity has established advanced age to be a risk factor for mortality (19) . When patients who have died form COVID-19 are investigated most were found to be males aged over 50 (20) . In order to minimize the effects of age and sex while comparing the family cluster to other unrelated COVID-19 patients in terms of clinical characteristics and prognosis, a group matched in terms of age and sex was selected: the mean age of the family cluster was 58.86\u00b119.02 years, comparable to reports regarding epidemiology of COVID-19 (1, 19, 21) and similar to that of Group2.

In our study, we have demonstrated the COVID-19 severity in patients forming the family cluster to be strikingly higher when compared to an unselected consecutive COVID-19 patient group who is age and sex matched and have a similar profile in terms of co-morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The same pattern was also recognized when chest CT findings of the family cluster were compared to other COVID-19 patients: all of the patients in the cluster had bilateral involvement whereas bilateral involvement was detected in only 63% of patients from Group2. More extensive disease involvement as detected by chest CT scans is recognized to be well correlated with both COVID-19 severity and worse disease prognosis (7, 26, 28) .",

Moreover, length of hospital stays and need for transfer to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. Mortality was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients forming the family cluster; however, the difference was not statistically significant, possibly due to low number of deaths. In terms of COVID-19 treatment, no significant differences could be established between two groups, while it is worth mentioning that small number of patients and observational nature of the study should be taken into consideration and caution should be exercised before drawing conclusions regarding impact of therapy on prognosis (Table 3) . Nevertheless Jashua et al. have demonstrated that hydroxycholoroquine administration to the SARS-COV-2 positive population was associated with an increased need for escalation of respiratory support (29) . And since no difference with regard to hydroxycholoroquine use was demonstrated between family cluster patients and other COVID-19 cases, treatment alone seems to be not related to the differences in the clinical course, which in turn may be more related to the severity of COVID-19 in the family cluster.",

Ye et al. have reported a COVID-19 cluster of five cases of from the same family in which transmission of COVID-19 via close contact with asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period has been suggested as a reason for the formation of family clusters (12) . A similar pattern can be recognized concerning the family cluster in the present study. Chan et al. has reported a family cluster of six patients underlining the importance of person-to-person transmission in family homes (13) . In our study, a family meeting consisting of four cases has been identified as the main event leading to formation of the cluster. A three-person family cluster reported by Yousefzadegan et al. is interesting with regards to the observed poor outcome. They have reported three previously healthy brothers, \"without histories of underlying diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac or hepatic disease, or malignancy\", aged 54-66 years, who have died after less than 2 weeks of illness. The authors suggest that such cases may imply that there may be a particular predisposition which may render related people from same family susceptible to COVID-Accepted Article 19 and/or to severe illness from COVID-19 (15) . Interestingly, Shi et al., while trying to establish a host risk score for estimating susceptibility to severe COVID-19, have demonstrated that having more infected family members seems to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19, emerging as a risk factor which needs to be further investigated (14) .",

Patients may have particular predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe illness, possibly variations in their immunological and inflammatory responses possibly mediated in at least in part by RAS system (15, 24, 34, 35) .
