There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterial-viral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterial-viral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25th-75th percentiles, 294-416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25th-75th percentiles, 1.6-1.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterial-viral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02)."

Adult patients (aged >18 years) with SCAP who were expected to require intensive care treatment for >48 hours and who were started on mechanical ventilation during the first 48 hours following ICU admission were included in this study. Patients with a life expectancy <24 hours due to the severity of their disease or whose hospital stay was >2 days prior to ICU admission were excluded.

Furthermore, the findings from this study only represent the situation encountered in intubated SCAP patients whose ICU stay was >48 hours. Unfortunately, samples could not be obtained from >10% of cases (11 of 60 SCAP patients) due to an unavailability of study personnel. Finally, the relatively small sample size may affect the statistical analysis; for example, multivariate logistic regression analyses could not be calculated.

The use of NP swabs has also been criticized, as they may not represent actual lower respiratory findings [15, 16] . This may have been the case for 5 SCAP patients in the present study in whom virus was detected only with the use of NP swabs. In the present investigation, the recovery of viral PCR was 1.8-fold higher in lower respiratory tract specimens than in NP swabs. Rhinovirus was discovered in 31% of the SCAP patients, which is higher than has previously been reported [16, 17] . In this study, 11 of 15 (73%) of the rhinovirus findings were detected in lower respiratory tract samples. The importance of lower respiratory tract samples for viral detection was also seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 [26, 27] . The PCR method selected may also influence the results; a commercial PCR test would have missed 53% of the rhinovirus SCAP cases compared with our in-house test. Taken together, the systematic use of invasive respiratory sampling methods and our custom in-house virus test may explain the higher total yield of viruses in the present series compared with earlier publications involving hospitalized CAP or SCAP patients [16, 17] . Viral analysis of the BAL fluid has been particularly useful for immunocompromised patients [28] [29] [30] . In this series, the presence of viruses in respiratory samples in SCAP patients was demonstrated in almost half of the cases. This result may have implications regarding the point of transmission of respiratory viruses in the ICU, especially among noninvasive ventilated SCAP patients. Larger studies are needed to demonstrate the prognostic importance of possible transmission of respiratory viral infections in the critical care environment."

In the present series, the mixed bacterial-viral infection group seemed to need a longer period of noradrenaline infusion than the pure bacterial infection group. Experimental studies have shown that in cases of respiratory bacterial-viral coinfections, the eradication of bacteria did not prevent fatal outcomes as a result of influenza infection [34] . On the other hand, in the present study and in a recent Korean SCAP study, the presence of viruses did not appear to affect outcomes [16] . This neutral finding has been shown among CAP patients as well [10, 18] . These findings may suggest that viral coinfection in the context of SCAP does not necessarily have any prognostic importance. The small numbers of patients in all of these studies prevent robust conclusions, however, considering the importance of viral infections on outcome."

Whether this difference was caused by more intensive inflammation in the mixed bacterial-viral group will remain an open question. The lowest PCT levels were found in the group of probably pure viral infections. These patients, however, had much higher PCT concentrations than has been thus far suggested as a level to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections [35, 36] . Furthermore, 3 patients in our series from the probably pure viral infection group had actually received antibiotics before respiratory sampling. Moreover, if PCR tests for the common bacterial causes of CAP and M. pneumoniae would have been available, at least some of the probably pure viral infections may have proved to be bacterial-viral infections [37] ."
