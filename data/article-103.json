            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect an ever-expanding number of people, resulting in an increase in the number of deaths globally. With the emergence of new variants, there is a corresponding decrease in the currently available vaccine efficacy, highlighting the need for greater insights into the viral epitope profile for both vaccine design and assessment. In this study, three immunodominant linear B cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) were identified by immunoinformatics prediction, and confirmed by ELISA with sera from Macaca fascicularis vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine. Further immunoinformatics analyses of these three epitopes gave rise to a method of linear B cell epitope prediction and selection. B cell epitopes in the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins were subsequently predicted and confirmed using convalescent sera from COVID-19 infected patients. Immunodominant epitopes were identified in three regions of the S2 domain, one region at the S1/S2 cleavage site and one region at the C-terminus of the M protein. Epitope mapping revealed that most of the amino acid changes found in variants of concern are located within B cell epitopes in the NTD, RBD, and S1/S2 cleavage site. This work provides insights into B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 as well as immunoinformatics methods for B cell epitope prediction, which will improve and enhance SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development against emergent variants."

Among these, the S protein has been the main target for vaccine development. It is composed of 1273 amino acid residues and divided into two subunits: S1 and S2 12 . The S1 subunit consists of the N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RDB), and C-terminal domain (CTD) 12 . The RBD spans from amino acid residue 319 to amino acid residue 541 on the S protein and it is responsible for interacting with the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to facilitate viral entry to the cell 12, 13 . The S1 subunit, particularly RBD, is thus considered the most important target for vaccine development. Indeed, neutralizing antibodies against the S protein have been characterized from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 [14] [15] [16] . Other main structural proteins embedded on the coronavirus membrane, M and E proteins, also play important roles in the viral assembly, budding, and replication of virus particles 17, 18 . Antibodies against these two proteins have also been detected in COVID-19 patients 16 ; however, it is not yet clear whether these antibodies confer neutralizing capacity. Therefore, they have not been the focus of vaccination strategies."

Identification of these immunogenic epitopes within a target protein can better inform and guide vaccine design.

Most of the B cell epitopes are identified using experimental methods, by which either overlapping peptides or short peptides are used in the immunoassays.

Currently, many tools and methods are available for the prediction of linear and conformational B cell epitopes. Among the recommended tools and resources for epitope prediction, the IEDB database provides multiple tools for the prediction of linear B cell epitopes and other associated parameters of B cell epitopes 21 . Several investigations have reported putative B cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins predicted by immunoinformatics approach [22] [23] [24] [25] . Although immunoinformatics tools can be used to explore potential epitopes, the peptides predicted by these methods cannot be claimed as epitopes and further experimental validation is still required to confirm whether they are genuine epitopes. Nevertheless, employing immunoinformatics for epitope prediction and screening could reduce the number of peptides used in experimental assays, thus saving both time and cost."

B cell epitopes in the RBD region predicted by the BepiPred-2.0 tool were tested with the sera from cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) vaccinated with a plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine. Competitive inhibition of RBD-ACE2 binding was performed to investigate neutralizing potentials of antibodies targeting the RBD immunodominant epitopes. Next, other characteristics of the RBD immunodominant epitopes were analyzed using multiple immunoinformatics tools. These results were then used to develop a novel immunoinformatics method for B cell epitope prediction and selection. Potential B cell epitopes in the proteins S, M, and E were predicted. The predicted B cell epitopes were verified experimentally using convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Finally, we then applied this workflow to identify epitopes in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1. and B.1.617.2). Here, we demonstrate that immunoinformatics is a potent tool for a rapid and precise identification of B cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, suggesting its future utility with other pathogens."

To further define a positive antibody response for an individual peptide, the OD450 obtained from a single vaccinated animal's sera was compared to that of (i) OD450 mean of control group + SD, and (ii) OD450 mean of control group + 3SD (Fig. 1B) . Peptides CoV2_S-11 and CoV2_S-11.2 showed reactivity with all 8 sera of the vaccinated group using both criteria.

Although the antibody response against epitope CoV2_S-10 in the vaccinated group was not significantly different from that of the control group (p = 0.08), 5 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and 2 sera from vaccinated monkeys showed reactivity with peptide CoV2_S-10 based on the analyses with criteria (i) and (ii), respectively.

It is noteworthy that epitope CoV2_S-11.2 is part of epitope CoV2_S-11, suggesting that epitope CoV2_S-11.2 is the core epitope of epitope CoV2_S-11. However, most of the monkey sera exhibited a slightly higher OD450 with peptide CoV2_S-11 than with peptide CoV2_S-11.2.

The number of epitope-responding sera of each epitope is summarized in Table 1 . Almost all epitopes reacted with at least one convalescent serum, suggesting their capability to elicit an antibody response in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. In the RBD, epitope CoV2_S-12.2 was most potent in eliciting antibody response in individuals naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2, although the responses in convalescent and control sera were not significantly different (p = 0.08). On the other hand, epitope CoV2_S-11.2 showed positive reactivity with 6 convalescent sera."

RBD, however, which is a small domain (aa 319-541) that plays an important role in the primary interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, is a more attractive alternative for vaccine development. Recombinant RBD subunit vaccines have been shown to stimulate immune responses in mice, rabbits and non-human primates and also protected Macaca mulatta from SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 30 . The company Baiya Phytopharm has developed a plant-produced RBD subunit vaccine, which exhibited an ability to induce anti-RBD antibodies resulting in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in mouse and non-human primate M. fascicularis models 26 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Due to its central function in viral biology, RBD has become a focus in host cell entry, immune induction, and immune escape studies by new variants. Thus, profiling of B cell epitopes in the RBD is of great importance and benefit to various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 studies. However, it has been consistently reported that in COVID-19 patients, epitopes in the RBD are less dominant compared to the S2 domain 16, 31, 32 . Despite extensive studies on antibody response against the RBD, B cell epitope profile in this domain is still unclear. Serological assays with sera from cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with plant-produced RBD subunit revealed three immunodominant linear B cell epitopes located in the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Interestingly, in COVID-19 patients, these three epitopes are recognized only as subdominant ones, while other peptides in the S1 CTD and S2 have been demonstrated as immunodominant 16, [32] [33] [34] . These results suggest that natural infection and vaccination could result in different patterns and levels of antibody responses. While natural infection can give rise to antibody responses against the whole viral proteome, RBD-based vaccines contain only a few epitopes and has no competitive interference from epitopes in other proteins. Thus, utilization of the RBD as an immunogen represent a better strategy to enhance antibody response against those subdominant epitopes in the RBD."

The results showed that antibodies targeting epitopes CoV2_S-10 and CoV2_S-11 were capable of inhibiting RBD-ACE2 interaction, thus suggesting their neutralizing potency. Interestingly, the opposite effect on an interaction between RBD and ACE2 was observed for CoV2_S-13 epitope. This is not surprising because residues in the CoV2_S-13 epitope are not directly responsible for interacting with the host cell receptor ACE2 35, 36 . Decreased RBD-ACE2 interaction in the presence of peptide CoV2_S-13 may be due to the replacement of antibodies targeting this epitope with antibodies targeting other epitopes such as CoV2_S-10 and CoV2_S-11, which can inhibit RBD-ACE2 binding. As a result, binding of the RBD to ACE2 was further inhibited (this assumes that only one antibody can bind to the RBD protein at a time). However, antibodies targeting the CoV2_S-13 epitope may be a hindrance at other processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as conformational changes and membrane fusion 37 , which occur after the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptor. As sera from these vaccinated monkeys were demonstrated to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 26 , it is possible that neutralizing activity in these sera mainly results from antibodies against the three immunodominant epitopes we identified in this study. However, there may be other neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, particularly in the form of conformational epitopes."

            "text": "Testing the synthetic peptides corresponding to the predicted epitopes in the S and M proteins with convalescent sera allowed us to determine their immunodominant properties. In agreement with other studies, our results showed that linear B cell epitopes in the RBD are less dominant compared to those within the S2 domain 16, 34 . Here, we reported six immunodominant epitopes (CoV2_S-15, -17, -20, -21, -21.1 and -21.2) located in four regions of the S protein and one immunodominant epitope located at the C-terminus of the M protein. Importantly, these immunodominant epitopes are in the functionally important regions of the S1 CTD and S2 domain. Epitope CoV2_S-15 (673-SYQTQTNSPRRAR SVASQSIIAYTMSLGAENSVAYSN-709) is located at the S1/S2 cleavage site, where the sequence RRAR can be recognized and cleaved by furin protease, resulting in separation of S1 and S2 domains during virus assembly 39, 40 . In addition, this epitope region also contains cleavage site 2 IAYTMSL, which is recognized and cleaved by Cathepsin L in the endosome and this process is also essential in S protein priming during cell entry 41 . Thus, antibodies targeting epitope CoV2_S-15 could possibly block the cleavage processing of the S protein during cell entry of the virus. Epitope CoV2_S-17 is found in the S2' cleavage site (residues 809-815), the target for cleavage by proteases including TMPRSS2, a serine protease, for S protein prime 42, 43 . Consequently, antibodies binding to this region may result in inhibition of the S2' cleavage, a crucial process during viral-cell entry. The epitope 809-PSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNKV-826, which overlaps with epitope CoV2_S-17, has been demonstrated as a neutralizing epitope 33 . Epitope CoV2_S-20 is located at the upstream region of the HR2, a domain involving in membrane fusion of SARS-CoV-2 during virus entry 44, 45 . Antibodies against this epitope may lead to inhibition of the membrane fusion and virus infection. Epitopes that overlap with CoV2_S-20 have been previously characterized as immunodominant as well as neutralizing epitopes 16, 34 . Another immunodominant epitope CoV2_S-21, which is located at the cytoplasmic domain of the S protein, has also been identified as one of the immunodominant epitopes in other studies 16, 34 . Although this epitope has not been clarified to elicit neutralizing antibodies, research into an alphacoronavirus suggests its potential. B cell epitopes located at the cytoplasmic domain of the S protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of alphacoronaviruses, is shown to be a target for recognition by the neutralizing antibody 2C10 46 . It remains possible that the epitope CoV2_S-21, which is in the same location as epitope 2C10, can elicit antibodies with neutralizing activity. For the immunodominant epitope in the M protein, further studies are needed to address whether the antibodies elicited by this epitope confer neutralizing activity. Based on these findings, the immunodominant epitopes CoV2_S-15, -17, -20 and -21 may represent valuable candidates for both vaccine development and assessment of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients. Here, we demonstrated that our immunoinformatics method is a valuable tool for predicting linear B cell epitopes both in wild type virus and new emerging strains. Mapping amino acid changes in the S protein of variants of concern to our B cell epitopes revealed that sequences within the S1 NTD, RBD and S1/S2 cleavage site are the main targets for amino acid substitutions and deletions. Some of these B cell epitopes with amino acid changes have been well characterized as neutralizing epitopes. For instance, epitopes CoV2_S-10 and -12 are located in the RBD. Additionally, the CoV2_S-3 epitope is a part of the epitope recognized by monoclonal neutralizing antibody 4A8 19 . Amino acid substitutions P681H in B.1.1.7 and P681R in B.1.617.2 are located in the CoV2_S-15.1 epitope that contains the sequence RRAR for S1/S2 furin cleavage, while A701V in the B.1.351 variant is located in the CoV2_S-15.2 epitope, which contains Cathepsin L cleavage site 41 . These findings may help explain why these new variants are more resistant to antibodies induced by either natural infection or by vaccines based on wild type SARS-CoV-2 as reported in several studies 7, 8, 10 ."

BepiPred-2.0 is an immunoinformatics tool used for predicting continuous/linear B cell/antibody epitope from protein sequences 48 . In this work, we used the cutoff of 0.5 and the epitope was defined based on the predicted sequence that contains at least 6 contiguous residues. It is noteworthy that prediction using BepiPred-2.0 tool through its original server (http:// www. cbs. dtu. dk/ servi ces/ BepiP red/) and the server provided by IEDB (http:// tools. iedb. org/ bcell/) could give a slight difference in the prediction result."

Other characteristics including coil structure, surface exposure/accessibility, antigenicity and hydrophilicity were predicted with multiple immunoinformatics tools. Coil structure was predicted with two tools, BepiPred-2.0 and IUPred. BepiPred 2.0 provides coil probability score of each amino acid residue, while IUPred (https:// iupred. elte. hu/) predicts intrinsically unstructured proteins, which infers coil structure 49 . In the prediction with the IUPred tool, the residues of the S protein predicted with disorder prediction score higher than 0.2 were considered unstructured. Surface accessibility was predicted with two tools, BepiPred-2.0 providing the probability of exposed residues and the method of Emini providing probability for being found on the surface 50 . Antigenicity propensity was predicted by the method of Kolaskar & Tongaonkar, a semi-empirical method 51 . Hydrophilicity was predicted by the method of Parker 52 . Notably, the method of Emini, Kolaskar & Tongaonkar, and Parker are provided by IEDB (http:// tools. iedb. org/ bcell/) and the default cutoff thresholds provided by the programs were used to select the sequences. In all prediction methods, only the predicted peptides with at least 6 contiguous residues were selected and used for fur- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ther analysis. All peptides obtained from predictions with different tools were aligned using AliView program 53 and a method for selection of potential B cell epitopes were then created."
