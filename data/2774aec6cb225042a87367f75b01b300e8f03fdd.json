Thus, the presence of these symptoms in addition to the life status of daily fighting against COVID-19 suggests that they must cope with psychological distress and are at risk of allostatic overload [9] . Indeed, according to clinimetric criteria, allostatic overload can be diagnosed in the presence of a current identifiable source of distress in the form of recent life events and/or chronic stress; the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual coping skills when its full nature and full circumstances are evaluated. In addition, the stressor is associated with difficulty in falling asleep, restless sleep, early morning awakening, lack of energy, dizziness, generalized anxiety, irritability, sadness, demoralization; significant impairment in Psychother Psychosom DOI: 10.1159/000507639 social or occupational functioning; and feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life [9] . The reasons for the psychological distress to which medical health workers were exposed might be related to the many difficulties of being safe at work, such as the initially insufficient understanding of the virus, the lack of prevention and control knowledge, the long-term workload, the high risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, the shortage of medical protective equipment [13, 23] , the lack of getting rest [24] , and the exposure to critical life events [25] , such as death. Exemplifications of such a distress are: (1) 16 of the 100 nurses at the Pohang Medical Center in North Gyeongsang Province resigned due to overwork among the COVID-19 epidemic [26] ; (2) > 3,000 medical health workers in (Wuhan) Hubei Province were infected with COVID-19 at a very early stage (before and in January of 2020).
