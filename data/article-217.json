            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia appeared in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout the world causing more than 8 million infections and close to 450,000 deaths by June 2020. 1, 2 Similar to previous coronaviruses, the newly identified virus is highly contagious; it is transmitted primarily through droplet spread and causes major outbreaks in the absence of adequate control measures. 3 The manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 are widely variable. The infection is asymptomatic in some individuals, while in others, it causes symptoms ranging from dry cough and dyspnea to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and leading to death in severe cases. 4, 5 To date, a number of studies have investigated the predictors of disease severity in COVID-19. Nevertheless, the sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence this disease course have not been fully defined. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Whether asthma, a common respiratory illness affecting 1 in 12 American adults, is associated with disease severity in COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Other important clinical factors remain understudied. For example, vitamin D deficiency affects 1 in 4 American adults, has an important immunologic role and has been suggested to increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18 However, vitamin D deficiency has not been analyzed as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 among patients infected with the virus."

Although we found no association between obesity and severe COVID-19, other studies observed that morbid obesity (body mass index \u226540) was a risk factor of disease severity. 11, 27 With regards to patients with neoplasm or a history of neoplasm, they were not found to have higher COVID-19 severity in our study. Likewise, the evidence of an association between asthma and COVID-19 severity is also scarce and the previous studies were underpowered as they included rare asthma cases among COVID-19 patients. 6, 15 Consistent with our findings, a recent analysis of UK biobank data concluded that asthma was associated with severe COVID-19 among 641 infected patients and that this association was driven by non-allergic asthma. 17 Our epidemiological study is also the first to investigate the association of conditions such as vitamin D deficiency, pure hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia with COVID-19 severity. An analysis of UK biobank data examined the serum levels of vitamin D and the risk of infection with COVID-19 and found no association, while another one performed among patients from the University of Chicago showed an increased risk of COVID-19 infection associated with vitamin D deficiency. 18, 35 However, the studies did not investigate the association of vitamin D and disease severity among patients who were already infected with SARS-CoV-2. 18, 35 In an ecological study, mortality rates among COVID-19 patients were compared among developed nations and it was suggested that countries with higher prevalence All rights reserved.

Our study examined pure hypercholesterolemia indicative of familial hypercholesterolemia, which is a major contributor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, which itself, is associated with severe COVID- 19. 40 Furthermore, high cholesterol might enhance the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells potentially causing acute vascular injury and triggering coagulopathies. 41 No study has also examined the relationship of osteoarthritis and anemia with severe COVID-19. Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease, particularly prevalent in older adults; it is associated with various comorbidities and with an increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and renal diseases. 42,43 Anemia affects 5.6% of all Americans, but this prevalence is increased to more than 10% in Americans aged 65 or older. 44,45 It is well-known to be a factor for poor prognosis in respiratory diseases such as COPD. 46 In our study however, it is unclear whether anemia is a factor for severe COVID-19 of or a consequence of the inflammation and cytokine production caused by the infection. 46 Our study has limitations. It included only patients from a single health system in the Midwest of the U.S. and may not be generalizable to the U.S. population overall.
