            "text": "The H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the H5N1 outbreak in 2005 have shocked the world as millions of people were infected and hundreds of thousands died due to the infections by the influenza virus. Oseltamivir, the most common drug to block the viral life cycle by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA) enzyme, has been less effective in some resistant cases due to the virus mutation. Presently, the binding of 10 chalcone derivatives towards H5N1 and H1N1 NAs in the non-catalytic and catalytic sites was studied using molecular docking. The in silico study was also conducted for its drug-like likeness such as Lipinski Rule, mutagenicity, toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles. The result demonstrates that two chalcones (1c and 2b) have the potential for future NA inhibitor development. Compound 1c inhibits H5N1 NA and H1N1 NA with IC 50 of 27.63 \u00b5M and 28.11 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas compound 2b inhibits NAs with IC 50 of 87.54 \u00b5M and 73.17 \u00b5M for H5N1 and H1N1, respectively. The in silico drug-like likeness prediction reveals that 1c is 62% better than 2b (58%) in meeting the criteria. The results suggested that 1c and 2b have potencies to be developed as non-competitive inhibitors of neuraminidase for the future development of anti-influenza drugs."

In conclusion, 1c ((E)-3-(4-butoxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one) and 2b ((E)-1-(3-(cyclopentyloxy)phenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl) prop-2-en-1-one) have potencies to be developed as antiinfluenza drugs by inhibiting H5N1 and H1N1 NA in the non-catalytic site."

However, the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was modest compared to the H5N1 outbreak. H5N1 strain is considered particularly dangerous because of its human fatality rate of over 50% to date and because of the risk that the virus may develop the ability to pass efficiently between humans. As of October 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 861 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 455 people since 2003 [6] . Thus, these instances in history warrant an enhanced pandemic preparedness, especially in this COVID-19 season. Although there have been no detected complications across the population in either seasonal or pandemic H1N1 influenza, the elderly patient has a higher risk for hospitalization and mortality during the seasonal H1N1 influenza [7] . In particular, patients having specific chronic conditions such as heart disorder, lung disease, hyperglycemia, renal failure, rheumatics, dementia, and thromboembolism are at high risk of influenza complications [8, 9] ."

NA has an important role in cleaving new virions from the infected cell [12] . Once it is blocked, the new virus could not spread over other organs [13] .

The shikimic acid inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir bind to the catalytic site of NA, which is a small pocket surrounded by basic sub-pocket, acidic subpocket as well as hydrophobic sub-pocket alongside its conserved amino acid residues [20] . Chalcone is a phenyl ring extended by an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl with various alkyl or aryl moieties next to the carbonyl group, making it too bulky to fit into the NA catalytic site [21] . A chalcone compound, namely 2-amino-5-[3-[4-[(E)-4chloro-3-oxobut-1-enyl]anilino]propyl]-4-methyl-1H-pyrimidin-6-one (NSC89853) is reported to show H5N1 NA inhibition from the screening of 20 compounds from NCI database. This inhibition may be due to the binding to the protein with an alternative mode, that is different from the known drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir). Although the potency of such a compound was not as strong as the known drugs, it may overcome the drug i.e. H274Y for the N1 protein [22] ."

The kinetics study of SA demonstrated a non-competitive inhibition against N1 and N2 NA. Furthermore, a molecular docking study predicted that SA interacted with N1 and N2 NA at the non-catalytic site. These results suggested that SA, which has a chalcone backbone, may serve as a potential therapeutic option to the currently available anti-influenza agents to overcome the drug resistance [23] .

Molecular docking of chalcones into the NA catalytic site was also conducted to compare their predicted binding affinities with the ones in the non-catalytic site. Further in silico studies to predict the drug-like likeness were also carried out employing Lipinski Rule, pharmacokinetic profile and toxicity prediction. The study was then followed by testing for their biological activities against H5N1 and H1N1 NA using in vitro MUNANA assay. In addition, the safety index was also calculated by studying the cytotoxicity effect of the most active compound toward a normal cell. Two chalcones demonstrated potential activity as neuraminidase of H5N1 and H1N1 inhibitors, respectively, with low toxicities to the normal cell lines and predicted to have considerably good drug-like structures."

The potency of the compound to be drug is commonly expressed by IC 50 , which is affected by its MW. The more potent drug should have a higher MW to minimize its dose in performing a pharmacological activity. Nevertheless, the MW should not be higher than 500 considering the drug absorption via the intestinal membrane [24] . The log P is the concentration of the compound in n-octanol divided by its concentration in water. Therefore, it reflects the balance of the compound's solubility in water during oral dissolution steps with its oral bioavailability in the blood system [24, 25] . The ideal log P < 5 indicates that the compounds are well soluble in the body fluid as well as absorbed through the gastrointestinal cell membrane, which then be transferred into the blood vascular. On the other hand, the number of HBD or HBA is associated with polarity to interact with water during the dissolution process as well as their molecular interaction via hydrogen bond with its receptor [24] . The rotatable bonds may influence their stability during ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and the receptor binding. Thus, the less flexible the chain in the molecule, the more stable the drug is to perform its activity [25] . The Polar Surface Area (PSA) is related to the permeability of drugs across the cell membrane in which the higher the PSA, the poorer the cell permeability (oral bioavailability) is [25] ."

            "text": "The in silico toxicity predictions have become a routine before processing compounds to be drug candidates. In this study, we also predicted the mutagenicity and toxicity profiles of the 10 chalcones. Generally, a compound's mutagenic properties are usually confirmed using the AMES test [26, 27] . The human Maximum Tolerated Dose (hMTD) is acceptable when the predicted toxic dose threshold in humans is more than 0.477. The potassium channels that mediate the cardiac repolarization in humans are represented by the values of hERG I and II. Hence, inhibiting this kind of protein would cause a long QT syndrome development that might lead to a fatal arrhythmia. The in vivo toxicity is often expressed LOAEL (lowest-observed-adverse-effect level) associates with the compound's lowest concentration which causes an adverse effect in human physiology. This is indicated by the alteration of morphology, function, growth, or development. The safety of a compound is higher as the LOAEL value increases. The liver injury commonly reflects the drug hepatotoxic properties, whereas the potential dermal adverse effects are determined by skin sensitization properties. The value of toxic endpoints, however, is measured by T. pyriformis and minnow toxicity [28] ."

            "text": "Nowadays, the drugs' safety to the environment is a concern. Low environmental damage is demonstrated by the values of T. pyriformis and minnow toxicity which are to be respectively higher than 0.5 and \u2212 0.3. Based on the AMES test, two compounds i.e. 2a and 4b are predicted not to be toxic, while 4b might have the possibility to be hepatotoxic. No chalcones inhibit the hERG I protein, but 1c, 2b, 2c and 3c inhibit hERG II. Most of the chalcones have a low maximum dose which is weakly tolerated in humans, except for 2a, 2b and 4b. In addition, all chalcones exhibit no skin sensitization. The oral rat acute toxicity LD 50 can be classified as very toxic (\u2264 5 mg/kg), toxic or moderately toxic (> 5 to < 500 mg/kg), harmful or slightly toxic (> 500 to < 2000 mg/kg), and non-toxic (> 2000 mg/kg) [29] . All compounds are predicted to be potentially less toxic with LD 50 ranging from 194.01 to 399 mg/kg. Oral rat LOAEL value shows that the ingestion chronic toxicity is relative to the limit of concentration and length of exposure, however, LOAEL does not solely represent drug safety accurately [30, 31] . This prediction showed that compounds 2a, 2c, 3a and 4b have lower values than the other compounds, which can be interpreted as they are able to cause any observable chronic toxicity at the lower amount and/or shorter time of exposure. Several compounds (2c, 3a, 3b and 3c) demonstrate T. Pyriformis toxicity potency, whereas, based on the minnow toxicity prediction, compounds 1a, 2a, 3a and 4b are deemed to be safe. Table 4 presents the AMES test results of the chalcones for mutagenicity prediction along with other toxicity profiles. Table 5 demonstrates that all chalcones are well absorbed through the human intestinal with near values to 100% into the blood system. In general, the water solubility of all chalcones are most likely poor as their log S value are lower than \u2212 4, except for 3a which has a log S value of \u2212 2.601; indicating that it may dissolve readily in the dissolution step. Furthermore, oral absorption prediction using Caco2 cell model [32] with the required value is higher than 0.90. Therefore, except for 2c and 4b, chalcones show good human gastrointestinal absorption. The skin permeability of chalcones is most likely suitable for the transdermal route because the values are approximately \u2212 2.5. A protein transport namely P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is crucial during the pharmacokinetics steps, however, this could have either advantages or disadvantages in therapeutic effect [33] . A compound is supposed to not inhibit P-gp, either P-gp I or P-gp II. In the ideal situation, it should not be acting as P-gp substrate either. According to the prediction, compounds 1c and 2b are predicted to inhibit the P-gp I activity, whereas compounds 2c, 3c, and 4b inhibited both P-gp I and P-gp II. In contrast, 2a acts like the substrate for P-gp, accordingly."

As a rule, VDss should be \u2265 \u2212 0.15. Among the 10 chalcones, three compounds (2c, 3a, and 3c) do not meet these criteria. The fraction unbound (fu) for all chalcones are predicted to be \u2264 0.15, indicating that more fractions of drug molecule are bound to the plasma protein. Besides VDss, the chalcones were also predicted for their ability to cross the brain membrane which is important as the compounds may affect the Central Nervous System (CNS) [34] . Values < \u2212 1 indicate poor Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability and < \u2212 3 for CNS permeability. In other words, the compound is poorly distributed to the brain and unable to penetrate CNS. From the results, all the 10 compounds should be carefully managed as there is potential for these chalcones to enter the CNS especially for 1a, 1b, 2b and 3b which can also penetrate BBB. The distribution profiles of the chalcones as predicted by software are presented in Table 6 ."

CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 are among the cytochrome P450 subfamilies, which play significant roles in drug metabolism [35] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are found in the brain and intestines, respectively, and are most likely responsible to metabolize the drug in their surrounding areas. Furthermore, CYP3A4 also affects oral bioavailability by first-pass metabolism. A compound that binds strongly to these CYPs could be acting as the substrate or inhibitor leading to the lower / higher bioavailability as well as activity of other drugs. This could be potential for the drug causing clinical drug-drug interactions, leading to adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. In this prediction, neither chalcones act as the substrate nor inhibitor for CYP2D6. However, except for 3a, all compounds act as CYP3A4 substrate, whereas 2c and 3c act as this enzyme's inhibitor. Furthermore, chalcones are likely to inhibit the CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 presented in Table 7 , which should be of concern when the compound is consumed with other drugs."

One of the main renal uptake transporters to remove the drug from the blood is the OCT2 transporter. It plays a pivotal role in the removal and renal clearance of mostly cationic drugs as well as endogenous compounds [37] . Inhibition of OCT2 (such as by cimetidine) elevates OCT2-dependent renal clearance drugs, hence altering pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles. Compound 3a is predicted to be the fastest compound excreted from the body due to its highest total clearance. In contrast, compound 2b is the slowest compound to be removed from the body due to its lowest total clearance. All chalcones have low total clearance (log Cl < 0.763), yet, it is generally desirable to develop a drug for oral administration without a high dosage regimen [38] . One chalcone, 2b, is predicted to act as renal OCT2 substrate that might lead to undesirable side effects. Figure 4 illustrates the total clearance of all chalcones that reflects their rate to be eliminated from the body system."

This mutation results in shrinkage of the enzyme's active site affecting the binding of NA inhibitor [39] . Another mutant is H274Y (H1N1), which was also reported to be resistant to oseltamivir as confirmed in about 20% isolates from humans in Europe [40, 41] . NA's active site is composed of eight functional residues (ARG118, ASP151, ARG152, ARG224, GLU276, ARG292, ARG371 and TYR406) and surrounded by 11 framework residues (GLU119, ARG156, TRP178, SER179, ASP198, ILE222, GLU227, HIS274, GLU277, ASN294 and GLU425) [42] . Structurally, chalcone consists of one aromatic ring extended by a predominantly trans-configuration of \u03b1,\u03b2unsaturated carbonyl. The relatively short carbon-carbon distance between \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alongside the relatively long C-C distances is 1.326 \u00c5 and 1.46 \u00c5, which is consistent with a localized double bond in the enone unit in this structure [43] . The chain next to the carbonyl group is usually prolonged by either alkyl or aryl moieties with various functional groups being attached. The conjugated double bond could make this type of compound less flexible. However, the C=O bond can present as either S-cis or S-trans conformation with respect to the vinylic double bond due to the free rotation along with the single bond between C-carbonylic and C\u03b1. This, therefore, could increase the conformation stability of such compounds during a dynamic environment [44] ."

The shikimic acid scaffold has been classically patterned for NA inhibitors due to its capability to form a stable chair conformation transition state of the non-aromatic six-member ring with the rather flat oxonium cation, and thereby arrange the position of important residues to interact with the shikimic binding groups [45] . Taking this into consideration, some aromatic compounds have been devised to mimic this transition state leading to their inhibition against NA [46, 47] ."

This falsepositive results could be due to the stability of the -NO 2 group, which is easily reduced by the acidic pH turning into an amine group (nitro reduction) [49] , which is measured in pH 6.5 in this MUNANA system. This conversion could make the 2b and 4b lose their interactions as suggested by the docking study, leading to their low inhibition against NA. The inconsistent results of 2b and 3b are not fully understood as well. Therefore, we suggest that a molecular dynamics simulation is performed to elucidate this phenomenon in future studies. On the other hand, there are inconsistent results between docking and in vitro results when the chalcones were docked into either non-catalytic and catalytic sites of H5N1. Therefore, it is recommended to study the kinetics of NA inhibition for the two most active compounds (1c and 2b) to confirm whether the mode of inhibition is competitive or non-competitive."

The protein structure was processed using AutoDock-Tools 1.5.6 (www. autod ock. scrip ps. edu) with the ligand separated from the protein. The grid for docking to the non-catalytic site of H1N1 NA and H5N1 NA was set to 94 \u00d7 72 \u00d7 96 and 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 80 with its spacing set to 0.375 \u00c5. The center of mass of the ligand was set to x = 26.852, y = \u2212 32.014, z = \u2212 1.019 for H1N1 NA, and x = \u2212 7.07, y = 28.242, z = 107.729 for H5N1 NA. Genetic Algorithm was chosen for docking calculation in Auto-Dock 4.2.3. The searching parameters were set to the default values (Population size = 150, maximum number of evals = 2,500,000, maximum of generations = 27,000, maximum number of top individuals that automatically survives = 1). The number of GA run was set to 100. Docking parameters such as random number generation, energy parameters, and step size were also set to the default values. The results were analyzed by checking the RMSD values, ligand-protein interactions, free energy of binding (FEB) as well as the number of conformations that exist in a population cluster [55] . For the subsequent molecular docking, the chalcone structure derivatives were sketched and energetically optimized using Hyperchem Professional version 8.0 (www. hyper. com) with MM + force field and Polak-Ribiere (Conjugate Gradient). The visualization of ligand-protein interaction Fig. 10 The structure of 10 chalcone derivatives (1a-4b) with different set of functional groups was conducted using Biovia Discovery Studio 2016 (www. accel rys. com)."

The H1N1 NA (A/California/04/2009) and H5N1 NA (A/Anhui/1/2005) enzymes were purchased from Sinobio. The fixed concentrations of H1N1 NA (0.3 u/mL) and MUNANA (100 mM) were optimized employing the previously described method. Vanillin was used as the positive control inhibitors [58] , and the H1N1 neuraminidase assay was prepared by mixing an assay buffer, tested samples (at concentrations 100 \u03bcg/mL in 1% of DMSO-Buffer), and a constant 0.3 unit/mL of neuraminidase which were pre-incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with 200 rpm. After the addition of 100 \u03bcM substrates, the reaction assays were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min with 200 rpm. To stop the reaction, 100 \u03bcl of glycine stop solution was added. The assays were carried out in triplicate. The assay protocol for H5N1 inhibition assay is similar to that of H1N1 but the concentrations being used were 0.15 u/mL, and 50 \u00b5M for the enzyme and substrate, respectively. A series of concentrations were prepared for those demonstrating > 50% of enzyme inhibition to calculate the IC 50 . The fluorescence intensity of NANA was measured by Modulus Microplate Reader with a UV optical kit at \u03bb 340/440 nm. The drug-dose dependent curve and its statistical analysis (95% confident interval) were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (https:// graph pad-prism. softw are. infor mer. com/5. 0/)."
