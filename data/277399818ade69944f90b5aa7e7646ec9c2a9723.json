            "text": "Open access disadvantaged children are 18 months behind their peers and 40% of this development gap had already emerged by the age of 5. 6 There is one universal intervention programme for preschool children in England, which specifically aims to address inequalities and promote health and development of young children: The Healthy Child Programme (HCP 0-5, see figure 1), led by Health visitors. Health visitors are specialist child and family public health nurses who lead a team of mixed skill staff (see figure 1 ). There are models of health visiting in some countries of the world: Child Health Nurses (Sweden), Public Health Nurses (America Canada, Ireland), Child and Family Health Nurses (Australia), Plunket Nurses (New Zealand), Social Nurses (Belgium), Lady Health Visitors and Lady Health Workers (Pakistan) and Patronage Nurses (Serbia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan). However, health Visiting in England is unique in its universal coverage (figure 1). A key part of the HCP 0-5 is five mandated contacts by the health visiting team before a child turns 3 year old (figure 1). The last of these reviews is at 2-2\u00bd year, and represents a vital opportunity to assess a child's readiness to learn, their physical and social and emotional development and to identify any additional support needed to start school on a level footing with their peers. 6 7 Since 2018, there has been particularly high cross-government policy focus on the role that the 2-2\u00bd year review can play in reducing social inequalities in cognitive development. [8] [9] [10] As part of a holistic assessment of the child during the 2-2\u00bd year review, practitioners are required to use the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3 11 ), and since 2020, the Early Language Identification Measure (ELIM) is recommended. See figure 1 for a more detailed explanation of these tools.",

Data from Public Health England (PHE) 'interim reporting metrics' (referred to as 'metrics' in this paper) indicate that 22% of eligible children in England did not have a record of 2-2\u00bd year review in 2018-2020, with substantial variation across the country (27%-97%). 6 12 PHE has now been replaced with Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (2021) so we refer to (ex)PHE. The Children's Commissioner and (ex)PHE both estimate that 9 out of 10 children receiving a 2-2\u00bd year review also had an ASQ-3 completed but other studies have found significant variability across England in the implementation and reporting of the ASQ-3. [13] [14] [15] The subuniversal reach of the 2-2\u00bd year review has prompted questions about whether some children are systematically more likely to miss out on a review. In 2020, the Children's Commissioner tried to ascertain if vulnerable children were differentially likely to have a 2-2\u00bd year review than their peers but found that most LAs did not collect the necessary data, concluding: 'There is little evidence that local areas are ensuring that their vulnerable young children are checked'. 13 Since then, (ex)PHE has published experimental statistics, 16 suggesting that the likelihood of receiving mandated reviews varies with ethnicity, and that children living in the most affluent areas of England were more likely to receive a mandated review than children living in the more deprived areas. 10 However, these emerging social patterns need further confirmation. Additionally, we do not know whether additional (non-mandated) contacts by the health visiting team are similarly patterned. It may be, for example, that the children who miss out on a mandated review are seeing members of the health visiting team regularly for other reasons. More recent experimental statistics from (ex)PHE (June 2021) suggested that children in the most deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to get additional contacts from the health visiting, but these analyses did not also include the mandated reviews. 17 18 AIM We aimed to ascertain whether certain groups of children were less likely to receive their 2-2\u00bd year review than other children. We used a national administrative dataset (the Community Services Dataset; CSDS) 19 to calculate the percentage of children in 2018/2019 who received their 2-2\u00bd year review, stratified by ethnic group, deprivation quintile, safeguarding vulnerability and Looked After Child Status. We investigated whether those that missed out on their 2-2\u00bd year review were seeing the health visiting team for other reasons in the same time period.",

CSDS captures basic child characteristics (age, ethnicity), contacts with health visiting services (type, frequency, length, date) and a wider range of identified needs in children such as referral from or to specialist services. Quintiles of deprivation are derived from the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), based on the child's postcode of usual address. CSDS is the only child-level national source of information about health visiting in England but is a relatively new dataset, with outputs classified by NHS Digital as experimental. To our knowledge, the only published analysis of CSDS has been (ex)PHE's experimental statistics describing patterns in mandated reviews, cited by the Leadsom review 10 16 and (separately) patterns of additional contacts. 17 Our 'research-ready' subset of data We analysed a pseudonymised extract of CSDS that was held within (ex)PHE for the purpose of delivering (ex) PHE's core work programme and priorities, for contacts between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. To account for variation in the completeness of CSDS data across England and over time, we developed and applied methods for identifying a subset of 'research-ready' CSDS data for analysis (full details in online supplemental material 1). The research-ready subset of data was restricted to LAs with a high level of data completeness. We checked the completeness of CSDS by comparing the number of eligible children and health visitor contacts recorded in CSDS with ONS data on births, health visitor contacts reported within (ex)PHE metrics and anonymised health visiting data obtained directly from three LAs.",

This highlights the importance of including additional contacts in analyses when investigating whether the delivery of health visiting in England is socially patterned. We also found that Looked After and the most deprived children who were in contact with the health vsiting sevice according to our data received more intensive health visiting than their peers, with more frequent face-to-face contacts.

We could not ascertain how far children without a 2-2\u00bd year review were having their needs formally assessed through other routes such as a statutory Looked After Child review, as part of a Child Protection Plan or had developmental delay or additional needs identified by the health visiting team prior to the 2-2 \u00bd year review, as suggested by an analysis by the Children's Commissioner in 2020. 13 The same analysis by the Children's Commissioner reported Open access that some LAs had stated that the 2-2 \u00bd year review may not always be appropriate when reviewing children with complex heath needs or development delays. 13 Our findings raise similar questions about whether the 2-2\u00bd year review and/or the ASQ-3 is perceived as appropriate for high need groups in the population, both by professionals and parents/carers. Our results also suggest that there might be two distinct groups of vulnerable children with regard to the receipt of health visiting. We identified a majority group of vulnerable children who received multiple face-to-face contacts within a 12-month period, often in the child's home. This group appears to be receiving intensive health visiting, consistent with the model of proportionate universalism that underpins health visiting in England (a universal service for all children but with greater support and service provision for children in families with identified needs). The second group comprised a substantial minority of vulnerable children who were not in contact with the health visitor team at all: 22% of children with safeguarding vulnerabilities and 29% of Looked After children did not have a record of either a 2-2\u00bd year review or any other face-to-face additional contact in the year. As we did not find evidence of attempted contacts with these children in CSDS, there is a real possibility that these vulnerable children might not have heard from or seen a member of the health visiting team within the year.",

Our results on additional contacts are also largely consistent with the (ex)PHE experimental statistics, which suggest that children likely to have higher needs (eg, deprived children and receiving statutory child protection services) receive more additional contacts than average. 17 Our results build on the (ex)PHE statistics by bringing together mandated and additional contacts in one analysis, which facilitates for the first time estimates of children not seeing the health visiting team for any reason in the 12-month period. Although the health visiting service seems to be achieving a model of proportionate universalism for some children with known vulnerabilities (with multiple visits a year, often in the child's home), there was also a substantial minority of vulnerable children without any recorded contact from the health visiting team. This is of significant concern, given the likely concentration of health and welfare need in these groups and makes it unlikely that the current format and delivery of the 2-2\u00bd year review is helping to address inequalities in school readiness as intended. The secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including heightened need and reduced workforce capacity (particularly the number of qualified health visitors), are likely to exacerbate the shortfall both in universal reach and provision of extra intensive services where needed. 20 ",

Further work is needed both on how best to support local practitioners to improve data recording in their systems and on how data transfer from local systems into CSDS might be improved, given the evidence that some data on health visiting contacts in local systems do not make it into CSDS. 24 ",

            "text": "Our data did not allow us to follow a child over time, which might mean we slightly underestimate 2-2\u00bd year reviews as some children may have had their 2-2\u00bd year review just before or after our study period. As administrative data, CSDS codes will not capture everything health visitors identify or deliver. Information might be coded with high accuracy on local systems but 'lost' in the transfer to NHS Digital, for example, with use of slightly different codes. There is some evidence of this, based on our comparison of two local areas with CSDS data. 24 Second, contacts may be miscoded. Although our analyses of ASQ-3 records provide some evidence of this, the consistency of our results with other data 24 suggests that miscoding does not explain the one in five children 'missing' a 2-2\u00bd year review. We know that much abuse and neglect of children will not be coded in administrative data, even if it is suspected by professionals 25 26 which will lead to underestimating differences between vulnerable and other children. Many data items were too poorly completed to use, for example, child disability and staff type (eg, health visitor, nursery nurse). CSDS does not capture quality or meaning of the interaction between health visitors and parents. To obtain a full picture of health visiting activity in England, and the contribution of this service to child health and well-being, all types of LAs need to be investigated using a triangulation of data sources, including CSDS, locally held data, surveys and in-depth qualitative data collected from professionals and families, as a study in Scotland is attempting 27 and as we have funding to do for children living with adverse childhood experiences in England. 28 Our results cannot be confidently generalised to all children in England. The children in the 'researchready' data were not nationally representative in terms of ethnicity (online supplemental material 1) and the excluded LAs might be systematically different from those we included which had more complete data. Although our findings should be treated as hypotheses, this study marks an important first step in making use of existing, routinely collected data to understand the coverage and intensity of health visiting services in England.",

This is a secondary analysis of non-identifiable administrative health data. It would not be feasible to obtain consent, because (1) we do not have access to names and addresses with which to contact individuals, and obtaining these contact details would require a further disclosure of personal information, and (2) we used data on 181 130 children. It would not be possible to contact this large number of families. However, CSDS does not contain any direct patient identifiers such as names, addresses, NHS numbers or full dates of birth. This means the threat to patient anonymity is very low.Provenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.Data availability statement Data may be obtained from a third party and are not publicly available.
