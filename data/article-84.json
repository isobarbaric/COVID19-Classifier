Stay home (lockdown), avoid crowds (limited opening hours and restricted access to stores), and wear a mask became new legally binding constraints to our everyday life. A constant, systematic media campaign made everyone aware of what not to do, and the consequences of breaking the law. For the first time, the Prime Minister asked social media influencers to promote the adherence to public health policies, leveraging the connection to the civic sense of younger users [2] ."

Although data are still limited, 15 cumulative minutes of exposure at a distance of 6 feet or less can be used as an operational definition for close contact [4] . As recommended by CDC, the determination of close contact should generally be made irrespective of whether the contact was wearing respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE). The impact of wearing a mask on reducing the exposure risk for specific daily activities is addressed in the \"Discussion\" Section 4. From the CDC's definition of closed contact, we derived a working definition of risk of exposure to COVID-19 for daily activities:"

In Italy, maximum crowding standards are regulated by the UNI10339 norm, which sets the maximum number of people allowable for design purposes, for each square meter of floor area, concerning various categories of public offices and retail premises [5] . To guarantee the resumption of activities after the first lockdown phase, the maximum crowding standard attributed to commercial establishments was set at 13.3 m 2 per person (example: three people can enter a 40 m 2 room) [6] . In May 2020, the National Institute for Occupational Accident Insurance (INAIL) produced a technical document about coffee shops and restaurants. It set the maximum crowding standard at 4 square meters per person [7] . We used both sets of crowding norms as multiplicands to determine the risk of exposure to COVID-19 before and after the Government's containment measures."

The study found a significant variance in the risk of exposure among different activities and, for the same activity, among different locations. Since the study was informed by publicly available mobility and crowding data, this simple method could inform individual choices when deciding to go out, containing the risk of COVID infection by merely avoiding or reducing exposure to crowded locations. Since this study is the first of a kind, we should answer some fundamental methodological questions before recommending its wider adoption. The first question concerns the appropriateness of mobility data to inform COVID-19 analysis of risk exposure. Google publicly discloses aggregated, anonymised GPS location data at metropolitan level containing users' density and proximity data. Accepted applications of location data include changes to population-level mobility and clustered behaviours useful to understand the risk of close contact, retrace likely diseases introduction and, most importantly, to inform the projections of risk of disease [12] . The second question is about the use of crowding standards, which measure the maximum number of people allowable in a premise rather than the actual number of individuals in the store at any given time. Actual crowding data can be obtained by learning location profiles from heterogeneous mobility datasets based on gravity models [13] . Collecting individual mobility data requires massive computational capacity and a standard for exchanging data between mobile operators and regulators (Mobility Data Specification). The outcomes of gravity models can inform public health policies but are of little help when making individual decisions about going out. Conversely, crowding standards are easier to understand for the general public: based on the DPCM norm, you should expect at least one but no more than three people in your closed contact risk area, a circle of six feet radius. If you can see more than three people around you, you know that the premise is overcrowded. The third question concerns the accuracy of predicting the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by activity based on crowding standards and the visit duration."

Restaurants and pubs have been closed down during the lockdown in April and December. Their opening hours have been drastically reduced across the period, with no service in the premises allowed after 6 p.m. Gyms are still closed. Coffee shops, fast-food restaurants, and hair salons have also been closed down during lockdown, and their opening hours reduced as well when re-opening has been allowed. Retail shops (non-food) were closed during the lockdown, but their activity resumed as usual when the lockdown was lifted. Activities showing the lowest risk level, such as grocery supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, post offices and gas stations, have never been closed and their store hours never reduced."

When eating a meal or sipping a coffee, you necessarily put your mask down. Considering that face masks may significantly reduce the exposure to the virus [14] , the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for restaurants of any kind (including fast food), pubs, and coffee shops can be greater than expected. Also, the notion of crowding standards may have contributed to understate the risk of social activities. Crowding standards account for the maximum allowable people per square meter, but they do not tell us how long the same person stays at least 15 min in a six-foot radius. Social activities, such as dining out, sitting at a coffee shop, or having a burger meal at the table carry a higher likelihood to have the same individuals around for longer than fifteen minutes than moving along the aisle of a supermarket or making an enquiry at the desk of a bank or a post office. Exercising at a gym or having your hair done at the hairdresser are also likely to carry a higher risk than filling a prescription at the pharmacy or refuelling your car. We can conclude that the use of face masks and the likelihood of permanence in a six feet radius does not change the distribution of the risk of exposure to COVID-19 as found by our study."

These measures are currently imposed on the general population as mandatory norms, without a transparent explanation of why these prohibitions are necessary preventive measures and not just arbitrary limitations of individual freedom. Prohibitions are generally poorly tolerated and, in the long run, the adherence to the new norms on daily lifestyle sharply decreases [15] . As an example, eating out is an essential part of the Italian lifestyle. The prolonged closure of restaurants, followed by a severe limitation of their opening hours (take-away and delivery only after 6 p.m.) has generated a vast dissatisfaction in the population, craving for social contact after a full year of distancing. It is conceivable that individuals would react differently if they were told that dining out carries the highest absolute risk of exposure to COVID-19 (from 10 to 26), fifty times higher than refuelling the car at a gas station or 20 times higher than grocery shopping. The use of a numerical indicator would have probably placated sooner the controversy about the re-opening of gyms and hair salons, which may carry a risk of exposure similar to dining out in case of prolonged duration of the visit [16, 17] ."

Moreover, for the same activity, it allows us to choose between different locations in our community where the absolute risk of exposure is lower. For example, when you decide to go to the post office, Google Maps can help you choose the location with the shortest mean duration of the visit. In Genoa's metropolitan area, the post office in Via Dante shows a mean visit duration of 45 min, while the post office in Via Ilva has a mean visit duration of just 15 min. The two offices are both downtown, only 700 m away from each other: a ten-minute walk can bring the risk of exposure to COVID-19 down to one third [18] ."

The study is subject to a risk of selection bias in the population for whom data is available, limited to smartphone users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. This is a general limitation imposed by the use of GPS mobility data [19] . Spatially and temporally aggregated mobility data also do not capture differences in how individuals use their phones, making unfeasible any further cohort analysis (e.g., by users' age, gender or income). No data privacy issue is associated with the mobility data used to inform our risk model. Google Map publicly provides the duration of visit data by premise in a strictly aggregated and anonymised form. No personally identifiable information, such as an individual's location, contacts or movement, was made available at any point."

Its simple numerical form can help policymakers effectively communicate difficult decisions concerning our daily lives, justifying their rationale using a language that everyone can understand.
