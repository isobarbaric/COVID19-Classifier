After the ED visit, 11 of 131 (8%) children were hospitalized: two out of 120 (2%) of the children at risk for COVID-19 with no PCR test data and nine out of 11 (82%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases. Overall, 488 phone call attempts were made, and 293 teleconsultations were performed, with a mean of 1.67 call attempts needed to achieve one teleconsultation. A total of 10 physicians and one resident were involved in this follow-up, for a mean time of 1.3 h per day. A physician assigned to the emergency room was responsible for the initial follow-up during the day in addition to receiving the patient flow. Figure 2 shows the proportion of patients who received at least one teleconsultation after discharge from the ED visit. Most teleconsultations did not occur as scheduled in the protocol, but 122 (93%) of the 131 eligible children had at least one follow-up teleconsultation. During their follow-up, 31 of 107 (29%) children had one or more unplanned outpatient consultations. For six of them, their parents were asked to consult either with their personal practitioner (n=2) or with the ED (n=4) after a teleconsultation. The other 25 consulted on their own. Among the 23 patients with available data, 13 (56%) consulted before the first planned teleconsultation. Overall, consultations took place outside the hospital for 12 children, in the ED for 12 children, and both in the ED and outside the hospital for seven children. Four children were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up period, including three being hospitalized before the first planned teleconsultation: two newborns returning to the ED, respectively, 6 and 24 h after discharge due to the appearance of fever and one 19-month-old boy hospitalized for 24 h because of diarrhea complicated by dehydration. The fourth patient had been hospitalized in another center and we did not recover the data on this hospitalization. The time to recovery could be evaluated for 101 children; it was less than 2 weeks for 83 of 101 (82%) children. The comparison between the children who had one or more unplanned outpatient consultations with the children who had no unplanned consultation is summarized in Table 3 . The children who had one or more unplanned outpatient consultations during the follow-up were more likely to have undergone laboratory examinations (35% vs. 12%) or chest X-ray at baseline (48% vs. 25%) than the children who had had no unplanned consultation (p<0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). Confirmed COVID-19 cases with a positive PCR test result were more likely to have had one or more unplanned outpatient consultations (55%) than the children at risk for COVID-19 with no PCR test data (31%, p=0.02).",

All these children were followed up via teleconsultation at a tertiary care center located in a high-incidence region of France during the first peak of the pandemic, i.e., a period of lockdown during which knowledge about pediatric COVID-19 was poor. Although this program might have seemed necessary in the first stage of the pandemic of an emerging pathogen in order to offer a secure remote follow-up, we found that this follow-up program was time-consuming. Moreover, we now know that it is not necessary to follow up all children who have COVID-19. Indeed, in line with the literature data, most of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in our pediatric study population were mild [6].",

At that time, France's national strategy did not involve testing all potentially infected children [7] , and the French health authorities recommended that only children hospitalized with a clinical presentation suggestive of COVID-19 should be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, most pediatric cases of COVID-19 during this period could not be confirmed.",

To deal with this issue and to follow up all children at risk for COVID-19, we decided to organize teleconsultations. Likewise, knowledge at that time indicated that many children infected with COVID-19 do not present with fever or respiratory symptoms. Therefore, our protocol did not include those children presenting with other signs. Our present results showed that this organizational approach was effective, since it enabled us to monitor 93% of the eligible children. Thanks to this telephone follow-up program, only 42 face-to-face consultations took place for 31 of the 131 children, reducing the pressure on the healthcare system and preventing the spread of the virus. We did not evaluate parental satisfaction, but received positive feedback from them, offering efficient parental reassurance.",

Indeed, we changed our testing strategy during the second wave of the pandemic and continued to provide remote follow-up only for confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

At the beginning of the pandemic, we did not have the equipment to carry out videoconsultations in our center, even though clinical evaluation is more efficient with a videoconferencing system. Many others telehealth systems have been described worldwide to increase the feasibility of COVID-19 patient monitoring, such as online platforms or smartphone apps. In France, a telesurveillance solution has been deployed in the greater Paris area to monitor adults with COVID-19 in their homes [8] . Clinical algorithms have been developed to detect patients with severe disease, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on those patients and offer close monitoring adjusted to their needs. Some centers have provided thermometers, pulse oximeters, or blood pressure cuffs for patients [9] . However, this equipment or technology was developed and applied mainly to an adult population, with limited pediatric tools available. Without a precise and objective assessment tool we had to rely on parental evaluations of the child. Therefore, we used a detailed evaluation chart for each phone call (Supplemental data) and had to educate parents about clinical assessment, such as respiratory rate measurement. In a Swiss oncology department, a team developed an algorithm to guide clinical decisions during the telephone follow-up of infected children [10] ; however, to develop such algorithms, data on the factors associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed and were not available during the first wave. We found that the children who needed an unplanned outpatient consultation or ED visit were more likely to have undergone laboratory or radiographic explorations at baseline, and that two of the four children who had needed secondary hospitalizations were newborns. These data suggest that those patients presented with more severe symptoms at onset, or were considered more vulnerable by the physicians. These findings suggest that the follow-up might have focused on those patients, but the design and the sample size of our study prevent us from drawing any definitive conclusion.",
