Thus far, many studies have reported and summarized the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. [4] [5] [6] Furthermore, the pathogenicity and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 are being wrestled at full stretch and the mystery of SARS-CoV-2 is gradually being unraveled. However, the exact origin species that carried SARS-CoV-2 remains a controversial issue, which is a potential threat to a new outbreak. 7, 8 As we learn more about the origins and course of this disease, we must appropriately looking into the mechanisms of its eradication. Until now, very little know about how the human body regulates and clears a SARS-CoV-2 infection which, in turn, makes it difficult to assess a complete recovery with no risk of infectivity to others. This is essential to halt the COVID-19 spread, \"flatten the curve\" and prevent additional outbreaks."

Thankfully, this has since improved drastically with the support of national medical teams from every other provinces comprising of nationwide medical experts and nurses. 9 This experience gave meaningful insight into the false negative rates of RT-PCR tests and possibility of recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To counteract the potential probability of false negative rate of RT-PCR tests, patients have been routinely undergone two or more multipoint throat-swabs over 24 hours apart before discharge. 10 Lan L et al. 11 reported that four medical professionals with COVID-19 who met criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) experienced repeat RT-PCR positivity, implying potential asymptomatic carrier states. Although it has not been demonstrated that patients with recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive remain infectious after discharge, this is an inevitable matter that must be addressed."

According to the degree of severity of COVID 19, the enrolled patients were categorized as 903 (83.1%) general cases, 144 (13.2%) severe cases and 40 (3.7%) critical cases on admission. The total mortality of severe and critical cases was 10.6%. The mortality of the all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was 1.8%, which was similar to that of a previous study 4 , but lower than that reported in another studies. 5, 17 This difference may be partly attributed to the fact that the majority proportion of cases were classified as general severity and that more medical resources were made available in the later stages of this pandemic which matches our window of enrollment into this study. Liang WH et al. 18 reported that the mortality of COVID-19 patients out of the Hubei Province was limited to 0.3%, as strict public health interventions were initiated in order to prevent further outbreak outside Hubei and medical resources were adequately provided for treatment. Additionally, previous studies indicated that older age was an important independent predictor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. 6, 12 Our findings support this claim; the median age of death was 83.0 years, distinctly higher than that of the discharged patients, which further suggests that increased age was associated with an increased risk of mortality."

However, three independent predictors were identified for patients with recurrence of positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA after treatment and hospital discharge. Elevated serum IL-6 level, lymphocyte count greater than 1.1*10 8 /L and consolidation on CT imaging during hospitalization were associated with higher likelihoods of recurrent SARS-Cov-2 RNA positivity after discharged. Partly similar to previous study, it showed that lymphocyte concentrations before discharge were significantly positively correlated with the time interval for virus reappearing, which confirmed the role of lymphocytes in the potential recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. 20 No significant differences were found in other factors in our cohort, including clinical severity of disease, CRP, D-dimer level, etc. IL-6, one of the main pro-inflammatory factors of the immune system, plays an important role in host defense against infections. However, due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the lower respiratory tract and rapidly replicated leads to excessive IL-6 release inducing an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 24 Previously, increased serum IL-6 level was reported to be observed in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 and to be associated with poor outcomes 25, 26 , which is a similar finding during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. 27 Concurrently, lymphopenia was also commonly noted in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe and critical cases 5, 26, 28 , suggesting dysregulated immune responses in this sub-cohort. However in our study, only 175 (16.1%) of 1087 cases showed a decrease in lymphocyte count, which again may be due to the fact that the cohort is largely comprised of general cases.

This leads to alveoli being completely filled by inflammatory exudate. 31, 32 Thus, during the recovery process of COVID-19 patients with lung consolidation, a potentially undetectable amount of SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the respiratory epithelium. This may result in the recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge."

This, in itself, may partially reflect another potential sign for recurrent positivity after discharge. Also, such fluctuations in one case partly ruled out the randomly error probability in RT-PCR detection. Thus, individuals may have already had immunity to eradicate the virus, so a period of duration was needed for complete recovery yet. However, if the individual immunity cannot deal with the recurrence, further treatment may be still needed."
