Is a vanity plate a Veblen good if it does not also appear on a luxury car? Second, a vanity license plate seems like a rather cheap Veblen good, and without more knowledge about how the Greek population perceives vanity plates it is hard to understand the true value of vanity plates in Greek society. We would really need to know more about the pricing of vanity plates to truly understand them as Veblen goods: what is the going rate for such a plate?"

            "text": "Reply: We show that it is highly unlikely that they are obtained legally; however, after their acquisition, they are not illegal. A car owner cannot be arrested for driving a car with a vanity plate, unless there is evidence that it was obtained illicitly. The first question raised under this point is whether a vanity plate by itself would count as a Veblen good; i.e., would it be considered a luxury item if it was displayed on a non-luxury car? Of course a vanity plate will not turn a middle-of-the-road model to a luxury vehicle. However, it might have a small effect: researchers found that in The Netherlands, a new license plate format, with absolutely no intrinsic value, increased a car's price by about 4% [3] . We have modified the beginning of the Discussion section accordingly, to allow for more nuance in our definitions. Regarding the second question raised under the point, the going rate is a few hundred of Euros, as we state in the beginning of the Discussion section. We have also made a few additional points on the value of the illicitly acquired vanity plates in the (new) Conclusions section."

            "text": "Reviewer Point P 2.4 -The last question I ask under P 2.3 points to a real gap in this article, but one which may be too large to actually address in the article (in which case, perhaps the authors could point to this as a research gap, and/or do more work themselves in future work): this is more understanding of the Greek context and what is considered to be luxury in the context. At a very basic level, it would be useful to know how the licensing process works. Could it be, for instance, that there are legal loopholes that allow, for instance, purchasers of new cars to request any license they want, and that is why we see the association between car type and vanity plates? On a related point: while I like the concept of \"conspicuous corruption\", doesn't this only work if everyone knows that vanity plates are widely understood to be an ill-gotten good? Is it in fact the case that Greek people generally understand vanity plates to be acquired through corrupt means? Also-the authors refer to a Wikipedia list to ascertain what is a luxury vehicle, but isn't such a list dependent on context? For instance, the author argue that a Smart car would be considered a luxury vehicle in Greece, but this would not necessarily be the case in other places where Smart Cars are more common and even looked down upon. Another issue is understanding the value of vanity plates-does the Greek population generally consider vanity plates to be a luxury good? Third, more qualitative evidence about how the black market in vanity plates in Greece works would be useful to bolster the author's claims that they are, in fact, considered luxury goods. On page 6, the authors talk about \"rumors\" regarding the price of vanity plates, but surely they could also conduct some interviews or find newspaper articles to support this claim?"

We have no proof that the Greek people in general understand that vanity plates are acquired through corrupt means (although we strongly suspect so). This points at the possibility that the value associated with a vanity plate is not only based on its scarcity, but is also works as a social marker that the owner \"knows the ropes\", or even is \"above the rules\". Smart cars are not considered luxury cars in Greece, but they are a status symbol for the design-conscious. We have clarified that, and it certainly is contextdependent. We have added the observation in the Discussion section. Regarding the last point, we added a short description of how the system works, giving a reference to a newsparer article (in Greek) [4] in the beginning of the Discussion section.

In order to make sure that the category is not off the mark, we cross-checked with the Euro Car Segments, which are in use in Europe for categorizing vehicles. In particular, we examined the \"F: luxury cars\" segment, by considering the sales in these segments for 2020, as reported by the Hellenic Association of Motor Vehicle Importers-Representatives. We found that all the F-segment cars sold in Greece in 2020 belonged indeed into the Wikipedia \"Luxury vehicles\" category, apart from Tesla and Ford Explorer cars. As Ford Explorer is not a brand (it is a brand and a model); therefore we only added Tesla in the examined luxury vehicles. This did not alter the statistical results."

We have asked for the audit report through a freedom of information request, which was however rejected, due to the report's confidentiality. However, the report has leaked, and we were thus able to add a reference to it from a newspaper article (in Greek, our translation of the most relevant part) in the Discussion section."
