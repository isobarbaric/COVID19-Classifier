While COVID-19 primarily causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, emerging literature suggests involvement of the nervous system as well. 1, 2 While most commonly reported neurological manifestations include altered mental status and headaches, 1, 2 those with severe disease are also at a higher risk for acute cerebrovascular events. 1 It is, therefore, important to obtain brain imaging in patients with a depressed neurological exam, so that those requiring invasive interventions can be identified early. Here we present two contrasting cases of COVID-19 infected patients, both of whom were found to have ischemic strokes, but only one undergwent timely neurosurgical intervention."

A 37-year old female, with an undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, was admitted to an outside hospital with several days of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and a positive COVID-19 test. Five days into her admission, she developed worsening hypoxemia with respiratory failure and was transferred to our facility on three vasopressors. Echocardiogram demonstrated underfilling of the left ventricle and dilation and akinesis of the right ventricle, concerning for massive pulmonary embolism. The patient was given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and started on a heparin drip. On arrival, she was heavily sedated with no documented neurological exam. Over the next 2 days, her cardiopulmonary status stabilized but her neurological exam remained poor, despite a sedation holiday."

Her best neurological exam, off sedation, was a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, with some preserved brain stem reflexes. Based on these findings, an emergent neurosurgical consult was obtained.

            "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, our understanding on how to approach and treat this patient population is also evolving. Literature from China has demonstrated that there is an overlap with respiratory and neurological symptoms in this patient population. [1] [2] [3] The current focus has been on how patients with neurological symptoms may be harboring an undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. However, in already diagnosed patients, it is important to understand that they are at an increased risk for cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). 4 According to a recent review of the stroke hospitalizations in a major center in New York, while the overall reported rates of strokes in COVID-19 patients were low, this patient population presenting with CVAs tended be younger and more severe compared to non-COVID patients, as seen in our two cases. 5 Coronaviruses, including COVID-19, exploit angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into the CNS through receptor expression in olfactory epithelium, neurons, and glial cells, ultimately resulting in neuronal damage, inflammation and potential hemorrhage. 3, 6 There is also evidence of COVID-19 patients becoming prothrombotic, further increasing stroke risk. 7, 8 In addition to ischemic and hemorrhagic infarcts in COVID-19 patients, other central nervous system complications that have been reported in this patient population include arteriopathies and encephalopathies, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). 9 Although the pulmonary system remains a primary focus of COVID-19 related morbidity, our cases demonstrate that these patients can develop severe neurological sequalae, which should alert the medical team to obtain early brain imaging. Patients with COVID-19 infection and neurological compromise, irrespective of age and comorbidities, can develop CVAs and may ultimately benefit from timely neurological and neurosurgical interventions."
