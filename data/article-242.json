            "text": "Background Forced solar gazing (FSG) appears to be more regularly employed as a method of torture in certain parts of the world than has previously been documented. Subjects and methods This study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009-2019. Results All clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients' associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity. Conclusion FSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases. Ophthalmic examination can carry a risk of re-traumatisation of individuals who have experienced FSG in a context of torture. 1234567890();,:"

The organisation therefore has extensive experience in assessing the physical and mental health issues encountered in torture survivors."

If they did not comply with these orders, they were beaten, kicked, shocked with electric batons or sprayed with noxious liquid. This mistreatment was usually repeated numerous times, on successive days. Committee considered and approved the use of this data for the purpose of this study. The documentation, and in particular the medicolegal reports, of clients who had an ophthalmic dimension to their torture was reviewed to confirm the nature of the mistreatment inflicted, (both general and specifically ophthalmic), the geographical location of the detention and torture, the nature of the presentation to Freedom from Torture, residual symptoms and signs, and to identify enduring comorbidities, both physical and psychological."

Most had suffered a wide variety of significant physical injuries causing skin scarring in addition to the FSG. In our case set, the mean interval between torture and the medicolegal examination was nearly 2 years. Serious sexual assault was a feature of all cases, and all 16 Congolese torture survivors had experienced rape. This high incidence of sexual torture in survivors from the DRC is in keeping with that described in several recent reports [2, 3]. All torture survivors in our case set were suffering from serious psychological comorbidities in association with their mistreatment, principally post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and problems with memory recall (especially in relation to autobiographical memory of the mistreatment events) [4] ."

Both had retinal clinical signs, one in the form of confluent circular patches of retinal pigmentary disturbance, and one in the form of small, congruent parafoveal pale chorioretinal patches. Both had some impairment of visual acuity-in one of these cases, corrected VA is recorded as 6/36 (hesitantly) each eye, and in the other case, 6/9 (hesitantly) each eye. However, the examinations were remarkable in that the clients exhibited a number of clinical features which appeared to be triggered by the process of examination itself, including pronounced involuntary blepharospasm, and a withdrawal response to bright lights, with head retraction and clear manifestation of heightened anxiety. One client appeared to experience episodes of psychological dissociation during the clinical assessment. This made evaluation of the findings very difficult."

In addition, from a medicolegal point of view, the non-ophthalmic aspects (such as skin scarring and psychiatric diagnoses) may represent the principal part of the legal submission. Therefore, the eye-related issues may, perhaps surprisingly, have received less attention in the medicolegal assessments than would be desired."

Our client group typically described being forced to look at the sun for half an hour or more."

Patients with PTSD are at risk of being retraumatised by physical and psychological examination, which can precipitate a vivid re-living of their torture experiences [21] . Clients with PTSD exhibit \"avoidance\" behaviour, in order to reduce the risk of flashbacks and intrusive memories, and this can entail a reluctance to volunteer information and to discuss the events surrounding their torture."

In more extreme forms of response, the inadvertent reminder to the client of his or her mistreatment may precipitate an episode of \"dissociation\", in which he or she may appear to become vacant and detached from their surroundings, and need to be re-orientated gently and patiently in time and place. This can be disconcerting for clinicians who are not familiar with the phenomenon, and are unprepared to deal with it. Clearly, it is important that all these manifestations of severe mental trauma are recognised and not simply labelled as poor compliance with examination. It is equally important that patients who exhibit such avoidance behaviour and in whom PTSD is suspected are referred to their GP for specialist assessment and treatment. If the potential for re-traumatisation is suspected, it is vital to minimise distress by limiting, or even discontinuing the clinical examination. Obviously, care should be taken that "

FSG, in our case series, was associated with other comorbidities, particularly serious mental health issues. As there may be few residual clinical ophthalmic signs of this form of torture when a period of time has elapsed, it may be necessary to undertake retinal imaging studies. The patient may appear to have difficulty complying with the clinical examination, which should be modified or discontinued if the he or she experiences signs of distress. This should be recognised as a feature of the patient's mental trauma, and ophthalmologists should ensure that the patient is receiving appropriate psychological assessment and support."
