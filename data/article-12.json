COVID-19 is having far-reaching consequences on people with epilepsy 5. Our study exemplifies the importance of delivering optimal care to mitigate risk ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global anguish unparalleled in recent times. As cases rise, increased pressure on health services, combined with severe disruption to people's everyday lives, can adversely affect individuals living with chronic illnesses, including people with epilepsy. Stressors related to disruption to healthcare, finances, mental well-being, relationships, schooling, physical activity, and increased isolation could increase seizures and impair epilepsy selfmanagement."

Respondents cited a change in seizures (19%, n=88), mental health difficulties (34%, n=161) and sleep disruption (26%, n=121) as the main reasons. Thirteen per cent found it difficult to take medication on time. A third had difficulty accessing medical services (n=154), with 8% having had an appointment canceled (n=39). Only a small proportion reported having had discussions about epilepsy related risks, such as safety precautions (16%, n=74); mental health (29%, n=134); sleep (30%, n=140); and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP; 15%, n=69) in the previous 12 months."

Also, there seems to be a history of poor risk communication in the months preceding the pandemic. As the UK witnesses a second COVID-19 wave, those involved in healthcare delivery must ensure optimal care is provided for people with chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, to ensure that avoidable morbidity and mortality is prevented during the pandemic, and beyond."

People with epilepsy are not considered to be more likely to contract COVID-19, or develop a more significant illness in case of infection (4, 5) . The indirect consequences of the pandemic could, however, impair their health and well-being in numerous ways (2) . Stressors, including economic challenges, anxiety, isolation, decreased physical activity, as well as interruptions to schooling, work, and family life, may increase seizures (6, 7) . Disruption to self-management practices, such as adherence to anti-seizure medications (ASMs), and a lack of access to healthcare may also play a role (8) (9) (10) . Together, these factors could increase seizures, worsen associated psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, and contribute to an increased risk of premature mortality (11) ."

We aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on people's health and well-being. Specifically, we evaluated whether people's exposure to risk had changed, including an increased risk of seizures, worsening morbidity, and their corresponding risk of premature mortality. While the surveys achieved a global reach in multiple languages, here we present the UK data. These data are derived from people with epilepsy and their caregivers, submitted during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic when the high rate of new COVID-19 infections had a considerable impact on epilepsy services (3, 24) . We explore various themes associated with COVID-19 and epilepsy, including respondents' demographics, health status, and their interactions with health services. We also assessed knowledge and exposure to risk, including factors associated with premature mortality in people with epilepsy (20) (21) (22) (23) ."

Six caregivers reported that changes to schooling and lifestyle contributed to declining mental and physical health in the person for whom they care. Notably, two caregivers reported improved health outcomes as the individual with epilepsy had fewer infections and benefited from spending more time at home. Twenty-five pieces of anecdotal data from the individual survey identified factors contributing to their declining health (table 2).

While significant emphasis has been placed on the direct health impacts of COVID-19, our results suggest that people with epilepsy have also experienced a decline in health and well-being. Survey respondents reported increased seizure frequency and seizure intensity, decreased adherence to ASMs, impaired mental health, and, in some instances, increased substance or alcohol use. These factors can lead to increased seizure activity in people with epilepsy and heighten the potential for premature death from SUDEP, unintentional injuries, or suicide (11, 27, 28) . Crucially, these changes have occurred in the context of restricted healthcare provision, reducing capacity to address concerns (39) . The vulnerability appears to be compounded by the deficiency in risk awareness and insufficient engagement with healthcare services before and during the pandemic."

Despite extensive social media messaging, we only received small numbers of respondents from BAME and older communities. Indirectly, this highlights the need for a tailored approach to allow information to reach people from these groups (53) (54) (55) .

Variable reporting was partially identified through analysis, but some inconsistencies in reporting may remain. We cannot quantify health changes due to the absence of baseline data before the pandemic and the possibility of recall bias (56) . Certain questions also will need refining in future iterations as, for example, people could report a change in their seizures without necessarily specifying in which direction (worsening or improvement) that change was. Qualitative data enable us to conclude that some individuals have noticed deterioration in seizure control. With the second version of the surveys, more quantitative data on this aspect will be sought."

Those marginalized by health and social care providers may be more reluctant to engage in research (53, 54) . We aim to overcome these barriers as the study progresses by providing the surveys in multiple languages and increasing our efforts in engaging with outreach groups.

            "text": "COVID-19 has caused a paradigm shift in health care provision. As the UK currently witnesses its second wave of cases, it is essential that those involved in healthcare delivery can ensure optimal care for people with epilepsy. A multifaceted, person-centered approach with appropriate use of currently available technologies can help bridge the emerging gap in healthcare provision, while mitigating the rising risks associated with epilepsy-related mortality. These interventions must also account for varying needs and levels of risk within populations. The results of the COV-E study carry relevance that extends beyond epilepsy care, and highlights themes that apply to many other long-term chronic illnesses (1, 2, 36) . Moving forward, we hope our research will facilitate further awareness and tailored targeting of strategies to help improve the care of people with epilepsy during and after the pandemic. We also hope to inspire a broader body of research on COVID-19 and its impact on people with chronic illnesses."

Respondents were asked whether they had, where relevant, discussed specific aspects relating to epilepsy with a clinician in the past twelve months.
