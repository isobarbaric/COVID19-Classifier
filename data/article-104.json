During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020, many health care practices were forced to implement telehealth services to meet patient and practice needs. In 2020, several temporary waivers, exceptions, and telehealth policy changes emerged across the nation. Many telehealth policies are state or federal specific. This report provides a general overview of essential telehealth policies and legislative updates along with resources and websites to guide and support nurse practitioners with contemporary regulations regarding telehealth billing."

            "text": "Telehealth is a strategy used to monitor and assist patient care providers with a variety of health care issues. Telehealth can occur in a virtual format using video, audio technology, or a combination of both. Examples of telehealth technologies include live videoconferencing, store-and-forward transmissions, remote patient monitoring, and mobile health (mHealth). Telehealth encounters can occur synchronously in real time such as with live video conferencing. Conversely, telehealth can occur asynchronously and recorded as with remote patient monitoring and store-and-forward transmissions. Based on the type of telehealth encounter, nurse practitioners (NPs) need to have knowledge, skills, and competencies to properly and legally bill for telehealth services. This report provides resources for NPs providing and billing for telehealth services as well as updates on timely and relevant telehealth policy billing issues and updates."

In early 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in an effort to broaden implementation of telehealth by health care providers and increase patient access to telehealth services. As a part of the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services allocated $175 billion to health care providers and hospitals through the Provider Relief Fund to assist providers with care during the COVID-19 pandemic. 3 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) additionally broadened access to Medicare telehealth services to beneficiaries not able to travel to a health care provider. 4 Before the CARES Act and some temporary waivers related to billing, telehealth services were limited to patient care provided in designated rural areas and at originating sites such as offices, hospitals, or other approved medical facilities. In the midst of the pandemic, many people were ordered to shelter in place or elected to self-isolate to avoid the threat of coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic created an urgent and compelling need for telehealth services for many different kinds of patient populations and expanded sites. NPs are major providers of diverse patient populations and health care services, and they need to have the knowledge, skills, and competencies to deliver telehealth services and accurately and legally bill for the services. 5"

CMS already made available payment for resources such as Virtual Check-Ins and E-Visits in 2019. Because Medicare beneficiaries are typically more high risk with the potential for multiple comorbidities, services such as evaluation and management of common problems, mental health counseling, and wellness care were added telehealth services during the pandemic. New additions to telehealth services were the allowance of patient self-reported home blood pressure readings for vitals during a visit and annual wellness examinations via telehealth. Additional changes to telehealth enacted in 2019 were the allowable Medicare telehealth services at renal dialysis facilities and home as well as treatment for substance use disorders or co-occurring mental illness disorders. 6 Summary of Medicare Telemedicine Services CMS currently recognizes 3 delivery methods for services to Medicare beneficiaries: e-visits, virtual check in, and telehealth visits. E-visits are not face-to-face, patient-initiated encounters, using an online patient portal generally integrated into the electronic health record system. Medicare includes codes for health care providers to bill based on time spent with the patient. Standardized medical procedural codes (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System [HCPCS]) are available for clinicians who may not independently bill for evaluation and management visits."

Patients wishing to use telehealth services offered specifically by UHC can access urgent care 24/7 through one of the approved platforms, Teladoc, American Well, and Doctor on Demand. 9 During the pandemic and national public health emergency, UHC is waiving any out-ofpocket expenses for COVID-19 testing, visits, or treatments, regardless of the site choice of office, emergency department, urgent care, or telehealth. 10 Requirements for encrypted software meeting HIPAA guidelines were relaxed at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, but most Blue Cross plans may again be requiring encrypted software for telehealth reimbursement as of October 1, 2020.

Examples of Medicare policies changes noted on the website include end-stage renal disease and home dialysis billing guidelines as well as nursing home and hospice care waived requirements for telehealth billing. Other topics are discussed, including frequency limitations for in-patient visits, subsequent skilled nursing facility and critical care consults, Stark Law waivers, and out-of-pocket co-pay waivers are discussed. 7 Services included but not limited to interprofessional telephone, internet, or electronic health record consultations (eConsult), remote monitoring services, and online digital evaluation (E-Visit) remain unchanged. 7 The CCHP website contains current state laws and reimbursement policies related to telehealth. Another resource, the Regional Telehealth Resource Centers, serves 12 geographic regions in the US and can provide further information about state-specific reimbursement policies. For example, the Southeast Region serves Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida and allows providers to view tools and resources, CMS waivers and billing guidance, and links to courses on telehealth presenting, telehealth coordination, and telehealth liaison.

            "text": "Many factors may affect whether telehealth is available or used in certain areas. Among patient-reported barriers to the use of telehealth are competency in use of technology, fear of identity theft, potential threats to independence and self-care, as well as possible disruption to services. 13 For example, patients indicate barriers to telehealth use may include NPs and other health care providers being less likely to advocate for patient needs and wishes. In federally funded health centers, the location of services, operational factors, patient demographics, and reimbursement policies all influence the use of telehealth. 14 For example, because federally funded health care centers are often in rural areas, technical issues were reported as a challenge to telehealth implementation. Telehealth is actually not new, but because of legislation, it has not been used by many NPs unless they practiced in areas where telehealth was legally allowable. 15 Rural health centers are more likely to report miscellaneous technical issues. Examples include inadequate space, inadequate providers and partners, and broadband equipment issues. 14 Specific to NPs, licensing and credentialing impact where NPs can practice and hamper their ability to work or practice across state lines without a second license to practice in another state. This gets expensive and involves following multiple state nursing guidelines both as a registered nurse and as a NP. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) Compact was adopted in August of 2020. This compact allows APRNs to hold 1 multistate license with the privilege to practice in another compact state. 16 Currently only 3 states, North Dakota, Idaho, and Wyoming have enacted this legislation. The compact will be implemented when 7 states have enacted the legislation. Efforts to adopt telehealth services present challenges for the elderly. Currently little information is published about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on telehealth adoption in the elderly. Known barriers documented in the literature include lack of special skills to operate equipment, potential threat to identity, and concerns that interventions could undermine self-care and coping. 13 Because telehealth is becoming more widely used and accepted by insurance payers, NPs in multiple specialties can now begin to use simple technology to provide cost-effective health care to patients. Telehealth is valuable not only to providers in primary care but also for NPs working in mental health performing psychiatric mental health counseling and treatment. Resources to assist NPs with reimbursement can be found on various sites as noted in Table 2. Further information regarding billing summaries for common payers can be found in Table 3 . One of the main differences in the policy changes during COVID-19 is the implementation of audioonly codes in addition to visual codes. A second difference is relaxation of the requirement for secure HIPAA-compliant video platforms. Thirdly, the originating site of services definition was expanded as previously mentioned."

They are also uniquely stationed to advocate for expansion of the APRN Compact to allow multistate licensure and impact the care of patients in many geographic areas. It is imperative that NPs review the Nurse Practice Act for the state where they practice. NPs should always review state-specific resources related to policy, current legislation, and billing guidelines to develop a solid plan for implementing telemedicine into the practice site."

NPs who did not have baseline knowledge of types of telehealth services and resources were left to work with practice managers to support the needs of patients in new and foreign ways. In 2017, the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties released Nurse Practitioner Core Competencies Content to provide examples of curriculum content to support the incorporation of telehealth into NP education. 17 In 2018, National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties additionally published a paper to support faculty with an overview of basic treatment modalities and strategies for incorporating telehealth into the educational platform. 18 More NP programs need to provide information on basic telehealth competencies and introduce students to resources to support and understand billing. Student confidence in basic telehealth knowledge can increase with even small changes in the NP curriculum. 19 "

Although more research is needed, one study found the impact of telehealth superior to in-person visits with regards to patient engagement. 20 Going forward, quality improvement initiatives aimed at addressing patient satisfaction with telehealth services as well as the use of remote patient-monitoring tools is needed. Additionally, studying the impact of telehealth on reducing 30-day readmission rates for certain chronic health conditions can potentially serve to reduce health care costs and improve mortality. For telehealth to continue on an uphill trajectory, insurance payers will also likely want to see outcomes data regarding the impact of telehealth on patient safety and quality.
