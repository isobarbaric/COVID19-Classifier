They do however thwart the serious forms of COVID-19 by eliciting an effective T cell and humoral (antibody) mediated immunity response. The two most commonly administered vaccines in the United States are the Moderna vaccine, which is a nucleoside modified messenger RNA that encodes SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (mRNA-1273), and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA that encodes the same protein (BNT162b2) 1, 4, 5 We have demonstrated in prior studies that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein attaches to endothelium via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and results in complement-mediated microvascular injury in the lung and other microvascular fields where endothelia have high ACE2+ expression such as the skin and brain 6 . The basis of the complement activation is that the spike glycoprotein has specific sugar moieties that are recognized by mannan-binding lectin, leading to the activation of MASP-2, ultimately resulting in the formation of C5b-9 that will then damage the cell membranes of the endothelium 7 .",

Similarly, mice injected with large doses of the S1 subunit (but not S2 subunit) of the spike protein developed neurological signs associated with central nervous system (CNS) vascular injury; the spike protein was evident in their damaged CNS microvessels 8 . Thus, one could postulate that the spike glycoprotein that is synthesized by the myocytes after receiving the mRNA-based vaccine could disseminate to select ACE2+ microvessels.

They have recently shown that human platelets express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the surface serine protease for spike protein priming. They went on to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and the spike protein directly enhance platelet aggregation and clot retraction in vitro, and thereby spike protein enhanced thrombosis formation in wild-type mice transfused with hACE2 transgenic platelets. Furthermore, recombinant human ACE2 protein and anti-spike monoclonal antibody inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced platelet activation 9 .",

In all cases the onset of the eruption was temporally associated with administering the vaccine and was characterized by a generalized papulovesicular, dermatitistous, and/or urticarial eruption in most cases (figures 3a,4a,5a,6a,6b,7a,8a,9a,10,11a, 12). Another patient developed Grover's disease 1 week following the Moderna vaccine. One case was consistent with guttate psoriasis, presenting with red scaly macules all over the body for two weeks following the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine(10a). A vasculitic presentation was noted in four patients including two patients who had acral lesions resembling perniosis while two patients had urticarial vasculitis. Eleven cases developed following the Moderna vaccine and seven cases occurred following the Pfizer vaccine. In 4 cases the vaccine administered was not known. The reactions occurred after the first dose in 5 cases and after the second dose in 9 cases, and in 8 cases it was not known if the eruption occurred after the first or second dose.

In addition, in one case there were pustules noted clinically although there was no histologic documentation of a pustular diathesis; the clinical impression was acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Another case presented a photo distributed papular eruption on an erythematous base. In most cases there were other overlapping morphologic reaction patterns defining a hybrid dermatitis, including cases showing combined eczematous, interface, vasculitic, and interstitial granulomatous features. The most common pattern was concurrent interface and eczematous dermatitis identified in 6 cases. Tissue eosinophilia was common. In all cases the clinical impression was congruous with the histologic findings, and in all cases the eruptions resolved either spontaneously or with topical or systemic steroid therapy except in one case where the eruption has persisted for 4.5 months; the patient will now be given a trial of ustekinumab. One case was compatible with guttate psoriasis, another T cell mediated process where it is established that an exogenous antigenic trigger is frequently implicated albeit typically in the context of streptococcal antigen (figure 10b). In another case an unusual picture of interface dermatitis with concomitant features of pityriasis rubra pilaris was observed.

The basis for doing the stain was to document evidence of human synthesis and establish the ability of spike glycoprotein to dock to ACE-2 positive vessels as a pseudovirion, a hypothesis proffered as the basis of systemic complement activation in the setting of severe and critical COVID-19. We were able to document spike glycoprotein in the cutaneous microvasculature in 10 cases tested. In particular, there were rare deep-seated vessels in the reticular dermis and subcutaneous fat that showed focal detection of spike glycoprotein in endothelium reflecting the preferential expression of ACE2 in the deeper microvessels. There were typically only one or at most a few positive staining vessels (less than 5) (figure 1d, 2c,d). A similar distribution was observed for IL-6, caspase 3, and or TNF alpha, but without significant microvascular complement deposition(figure 12c). The overall amount of microvascular spike glycoprotein and ACE-2 expression was much less than that observed in the setting of thrombotic retiform purpura of severe and critical COVID-19 In all four cases, endothelial cell immunoreactivity was much less for TNFa, IL6, and caspase 3 staining compared to the normal deltoid biopsies from people who died of COVID-19.

One of the hallmarks of the vaccine reactions that we encountered was a hybrid inflammatory pattern; a case could show a mixed pattern best exemplified by cases of interface and eczematous dermatitis with an accompanying mild lymphocytic vasculitis. These aforesaid specific histologic patterns are commonly reflective of underlying type IV hypersensitivity. One case associated with a striking pattern of interface dermatitis had concomitant pityriasis rubra pilaris like changes . This patient has had a persistent severe generalized skin eruption for at least 4 months refractory to prednisone and has now been started on ustekinumab therapy . One biopsy showed a distinctive folliculocentric immune reaction that falls under the rubric of sterile neutrophilic folliculitis with folliculocentric vascular injury 13 . Pathogenetically this type of sterile neutrophilic follicular reaction has been hypothesized to represent a TH1 dominant type IV immune response where the cytokine milieu is conducive to a neutrophilic influx into the skin 13, 14 . A minor subset of cases demonstrated an urticarial vasculitis, a morphologic subset of leukocytoclastic vasculitis characteristically triggered by immune complex deposition but other proinflammatory pathways can be implicated. One might consider a scenario where antibodies bound to an undefined foreign protein introduced by the vaccine could be deposited in microvessels as an immune complex and trigger the classic complement pathway to result in a neutrophil rich inflammatory reaction.",

In the two normal post-Pfizer vaccination biopsies occasional endothelial cells in the microvessels of the deep dermis and subcutis were positive for spike glycoprotein (less than 5 microvessels with some degree of positivity in the endothelial lining cells). Unlike the deltoid skin biopsies from the people with severe COVID 19 that contained also the envelope and membrane viral proteins within the endothelium, these additional viral capsid proteins were absent in the post-Pfizer vaccination biopsies (figure 16) (data not shown). Complement studies to assess for C3d, C4d, and C5b-9 deposition were conducted on both cases and only rare vessels showed any evidence of complement deposition and hence did not support a diagnosis of systemic complement activation. Nuance software co-expression analysis showed co-expression of spike glycoprotein with caspase 3, TNFalpha and IL6(figure 16). An additional deltoid biopsy was procured from another physician author who received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. Spike glycoprotein was not identified(figure 17).

The skin biopsy exhibited a minimal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. The C5b-9 studies showed roughly 8 positive staining vessels including capillaries, venules, and a single arteriole, a fashion that was not consistent with systemic complement activation.

Ferrazano and coworkers described the first registered cases of cutaneous adverse reactions in North-East Italy after the m-RNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty\u00ae-BioNTech/Pfizer in Trieste 16 . They reported one or more cutaneous adverse effects in 0.22% of all vaccinated individuals and 16.54% of communicated adverseeffects. The reactions were divided into those at the vaccine site and those that were discontiguous and more generalized. The reactions included urticaria, malar erythema, a hand eruption, pityriasis rosea and one resembling a fixed drug eruption. Reactions were seen with the first dose or the second dose in the absence of a reaction to the first dose and could appear as quickly as 60 hours from the time of the initial vaccination. In trying to establish the trigger it was suggested that polyethylene-glycol 200 which is a known cause of immediate type I hypersensitivity as well as delayed reactions could be responsible. Other terms have been used to describe the polymers such as macrogol, oxyethylene polymer and laureth. In a second review that examined over 400 adverse cutaneous reactions collected from a United States based data base, over 80% of cases were seen in association with the Moderna vaccine; less than 20% of the reactions were associated with the Pfizer vaccine17 . There was a predominance of the adverse vaccine reaction in women. The adverse reaction could occur after the first or second dose and if it occurred after the first dose there was a 40% likelihood that it would occur again after the second dose. There were two basic time frames: an immediate one that occurred at 1 to 3 days and a delayed one developing 6 to 7 days after the vaccine. The reactions included swelling at the vaccine site, morbilliform eruptions, pityriasis rosea like and chilblains/perniosis. We have seen cases of post vaccination erythema at the site of the vaccine including one case with concomitant lymphangitis but without any biopsy to confirm the nature of the inflammatory response. Authors have suggested certain agents used in the vaccine vehicle as the putative trigger such as polyethylene glycol17 .PathogenesisThe role of a product in the vaccine vehicle as an allergenWhen one considers vaccines in general and not specifically in regard to the SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, the common constituents found in diverse vaccines have elicited a variety of systemic allergic contact dermatitis reactions. The most common culprits are antibiotics (eg, neomycin) certain key preservatives such as formaldehyde, propylene glycol, and sorbic acid. In each patient that develops an adverse reaction one could consider patch testing to see which constituent elicits the immune response.The cutaneous reactions associated with the COVID-19 vaccine appear to be self-limited. The histology suggests that two common limbs of hypersensitivity seen with other exogenous antigens could be the basis although unproven. The dominant pattern is one that would be consistent with a systemic eczematoid hypersensitivity reactions. In our series and consistent with other reported studies the most common pattern is one resembling type IV hypersensitivity characterized by an eczematous dermatitis and or a concomitant cytotoxic interface dermatitis. One might suggest that the antigen could be a substance in the vehicle used to administer the vaccine, although a T cell and/or humoral reaction to the myocyte-manufactured spike glycoprotein emerges as a putative antigenic trigger especially given its localization to the cutaneous microvessels. An antigen unrelated to the vaccine but where an immune response to the antigen becoming unmasked due to vaccine associated immune enhancement is possible.Without testing the various components of the vaccines, it would be difficult to elucidate the antigenic trigger. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contains: messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose. The Pfizer vaccine contains mRNA, lipids including (4-hydroxybutyl) azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,Nditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol) potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dehydrate and sucrose. As already mentioned a significant emphasis has been placed on polyethylene glycol as a putative antigenic trigger. All of the COVID-19 vaccine reactions were seen after the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine using a replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus vector that expresses the SARS COV-2 spike protein in a stabilized conformation.

Antigenically primed memory T cells along with Langerhans cells are involved 24,21 , with recruitment of memory T cells to sites on the skin where the topical agent was previously applied. Discontiguous sites could become inflamed analogous to the cutaneous id reaction occurring at cutaneous sites distant from the primary dermatosis. The allergens instead of being topical are travelling through the circulation by varying routes such as ingestion, intravenous administration or intramuscular injection such as through a vaccine. The clinical presentation is somewhat diverse whereby among the cutaneous manifestations are an eruption at the prior site of allergic contact dermatitis, an eruption at a site of a prior patch test, vesicular hand dermatitis and pruritic papules on the elbows and knees, erythroderma and small vessel vasculitis like lesions. After metabolism of the causative systemic antigen such as a drug in the skinwhere it functions as a hapten-carrier complex, the antigen is processed by antigen-presenting cells and leads to clonal expansion of T cells in the local lymph node, which can then migrate to the skin and elicit a type IV immune response.

Regardless of the exact mechanisms one can explain at least some of the vaccine associated cutaneous reactions through the mechanisms that have been advanced for systemic contact dermatitis since the well known cutaneous sensitizer polyethylene glycol is found in both Pfizer and Moderna vaccine preparations24,21 .Spike Glycoprotein as the potential stimulus to the post vaccine reactionGiven the fact that some of the reactions resemble classic cutaneous manifestations encountered in mild COVID-19 such as pityriasis rosea(i.e. those cases showing a hybrid interface and eczematous dermatitis with a concomitant low grade lymphocytic vascular injury), interstitial granulomatous inflammation, small vessel vasculitis, and chilblains/perniosis one has to consider that an additional potential candidate for this vaccine rection could be the novel protein manufactured by the genetically altered myocytes.Another question is whether or not the localization of the hypersensitivity in anyway relates to the in situ cutaneous localization of spike glycoprotein because of the relatively high level of ACE-2 expression in the cutaneous microvessels relative to other organ sites. Indeed the immunohistochemical stain to assess for spike glycoprotein showed consistent reproducible findings in all samples tested. The basis for doing the stain was to document evidence of human synthesis and establish the ability of spike glycoprotein to dock to ACE-2 positive vessels as a pseudovirion, a hypothesis offered as the basis of systemic complement activation in the setting of severe and critical COVID-19. We were able to show spike glycoprotein in the cutaneous microvasculature in all cases tested. In particular, there were occasional deep-seated vessels in the deep reticular dermis and fat that showed focal expression of spike glycoprotein in endothelium, which is not surprising as it reflects the preferential expression of ACE2 in deeper dermal and subcutaneous microvessels. However there were only one to rare positive staining vessels. A similar distribution was observed for IL-6, caspase 3, and or TNF alpha, but without significant microvascular complement deposition observed. The overall amount of spike glycoprotein in the microvessels was much less than what we observed in the setting of thrombotic retiform purpura of severe and critical COVID-19.

In this particular case while the skin eruption was typical for a COVID-19 vaccine reaction given the combination of interface dermatitis along with lymphocytic and granulomatous vasculitis there was also evidence of systemic complement pathway activation. The patient was not known to have any prior disease associated with hemolysis such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Another 21 year old patient developed myocardial dysfunction whereby imaging studies suggested myocarditis. The deltoid skin biopsy did not disclose any evidence of excessive type I interferon signaling nor was there evidence of systemic complement pathway activation unlike the pattern of excessive complement vascular deposition we see in the normal deltoid skin biopsies of patients with severe COVID including a previously reported patient who developed significant myocardial disease likely representing a small vessel vasculitic variant of myocarditis in the setting of severe COVID-197 . Also the amount of spike glycoprotein localized to the microvessels and the endothelial based cytokine response was similar to the two healthy adults who underwent deltoid biopsied following the vaccine. There have been 226 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis in people ages 30 and younger who have received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, occurring more commonly after the second dose and with a higher incidence in males. Symptoms include chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, ST or",

The basis for the lack of complement activation is unclear but the amount of the protein localized to the receptor binding site might be a factor, as could be a difference in the glycosylation pattern of the wild type spike protein versus the protein synthesized by vaccinated myocytes. In the young woman who developed myocardial insufficiency post-Moderna vaccine there were no thrombotic changes nor was there any evidence of complement pathway activation. In addition the amount of spike glycoprotein deposition was minimal and consistent with the extent of deposition seen in the other cases.

The exact antigenic trigger is not yet established, but the possibilities include an exogenous agent found within the vaccine vehicle namely polyethylene glycol versus the foreign spike protein manufactured by human myocytes functioning as a systemic antigen capable of eliciting classic forms of hypersensitivity especially type IV but also antibody mediated reactions resulting in immune complex deposition.; however, an unrelated antigen or an underlying genetic predisposition for an inflammatory dermatosis like psoriasis which become unmasked due to immune enhancing properties of the vaccine has to be considered as well. The exceptionally small amount of spike glycoprotein that disseminates to ACE2 positive microvascular never results in a disease process that resembles severe or critical COVID-19 and hence not surprisingly complement pathway activation is not seen and thrombotic vascular complications while rarely reported following the vaccine have not been proven to be caused by thevaccine. 26.
