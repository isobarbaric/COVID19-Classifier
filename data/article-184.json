SUMMARY Chronic heart failure is one of the most debilitating chronic conditions affecting millions of people and adding a significant financial burden to health care systems worldwide. Despite the significant therapeutic advances achieved over the last decade, morbidity and mortality remain high. Multiple catheter-based interventional therapies targeting different physiological and anatomical targets are already under different stages of clinical investigation. The present paper provides a technical overview of the most relevant catheter-based interventional therapies under clinical investigation. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2022;7:181-191)"

However, in the overall study population, there were no changes in functional capacity, cardiac-related death, or rehospitalization rates (12) . Specifically, in the STICH (Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure) trial (13) , 555 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting plus surgical ventricular reconstruction and showed a postoperative LVESV index (LVESVi) #70 mL/m 2 by echocardiography experienced a survival benefit compared with coronary artery bypass grafting alone (13) . The benefit of this approach was less clear in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and extensive ventricular dilation because it technically limits the ability to achieve sufficient reduction in LV volume (5) . In addition, the highly invasive nature and risk associated with this surgical procedure have led most major surgical centers to abandon this procedure (5) . The emergence of less invasive catheter- repeated as many times as needed at progressively more basilar levels so as to exclude as much of the infarcted, dyskinetic myocardium as possible."
