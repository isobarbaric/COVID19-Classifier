SUMMARY Chronic heart failure is one of the most debilitating chronic conditions affecting millions of people and adding a significant financial burden to health care systems worldwide. Despite the significant therapeutic advances achieved over the last decade, morbidity and mortality remain high. Multiple catheter-based interventional therapies targeting different physiological and anatomical targets are already under different stages of clinical investigation. The present paper provides a technical overview of the most relevant catheter-based interventional therapies under clinical investigation. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2022;7:181-191)",

However, in the overall study population, there were no changes in functional capacity, cardiac-related death, or rehospitalization rates (12) . Specifically, in the STICH (Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure) trial (13) , 555 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting plus surgical ventricular reconstruction and showed a postoperative LVESV index (LVESVi) #70 mL/m 2 by echocardiography experienced a survival benefit compared with coronary artery bypass grafting alone (13) . The benefit of this approach was less clear in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and extensive ventricular dilation because it technically limits the ability to achieve sufficient reduction in LV volume (5) . In addition, the highly invasive nature and risk associated with this surgical procedure have led most major surgical centers to abandon this procedure (5) . The emergence of less invasive catheter- repeated as many times as needed at progressively more basilar levels so as to exclude as much of the infarcted, dyskinetic myocardium as possible.",

In this field, multiple catheter-based technologies targeting different physiological and anatomical targets are already in advanced clinical validation phases.

In this review, we summarize the progress achieved to date in some of these rapidly emerging therapeutic areas intended to address a wide range of unmet needs experienced by patients with chronic HF (Central Illustration). fibrosis result in progressive cavity dilation, distortion of the normal elliptical shape, and left ventricular (LV) contractile dysfunction (3). Alterations in myocyte length and width are the basis of the changes seen in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) and LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) in LV remodeling (4). These pathological changes result in rightward shifts of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships toward larger volumes (5). Based on Laplace's law, this shift of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships toward larger volumes results in a decreased slope (contractility) of the end-systolic pressurevolume relationship and increased systolic and diastolic mechanical stress on myocytes,",

A wirelessly powered chronic device is being developed for longer-term use for patients with chronic HF. At the core of both platforms is a pulsatile-conforming aortic radial collapsible stent pump design allowing for a relatively easy femoral insertion and aortic positioning. Once properly positioned in the descending aorta proximal to the renal arteries, the stent distends the aortic wall (w1-2 mm) to provide fixation without need for invasive anchoring. A 22-mm nitinol stent cage protects the aortic wall from the pump impellers. Because the stent fills the entire inner diameter of the aorta and possesses a 20-to 23-mm impeller, the pump needs lower revolutions per minute to achieve 4 to 6 L/min of flow. The pump increases blood flow to the kidneys, improving renal perfusion and urine output, potentially reducing the need for diuretics and possibly decreasing HF readmissions. However, formal published data regarding this device are lacking at this time. The Reitan Catheter Pump (Cardiobridge) is another percutaneous ventricular assist device to help treat patients with acute decompensated HF and cardiorenal syndrome. It consists of a cathetermounted distal pump head with a foldable propeller and surrounding cage, an interface unit, and an external drive unit with user console. The collapsed 10-F pump-head is delivered via a 14-F sheath placed in the femoral artery and is advanced to the proximal descending aorta about 5 to 10 cm distal to the left subclavian artery. Once in position, the pump head is deployed, and the propeller blades are extended and set to rotate at 8,000 to 11,000 rpm with the goal to achieve a radiofemoral mean arterial gradient of 10 mm Hg. This is thought to help unload the LV and increase the perfusion pressure distally. A first-inhuman study confirmed the device safety and feasibility during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (23), and a subsequent study by Keeble et al (24) studied the hemodynamic and renal effects of this device in 20 patients (2 were excluded due to anatomic incompatibility with the device) with advanced HF (LVEF <30%) in acute decompensation requiring inotropic or mechanical circulatory support. Patients received support for a mean of 18.3 hours, and the device increased cardiac index (1.8 AE 0.3 L/min/m 2 to 2.4 AE 0.5 L/min/m 2 ; P \u00bc 0.04) and urine output (71 AE 65 mL/h to 227 AE 179 mL/h; P \u00bc 0.006) while decreasing serum creatinine (188 AE 87 mmol/L to 161 AE 78 mmol/L; P \u00bc 0.0007) without clinically significant hemolysis, vascular injury, or thromboembolic complications (24). RENAL VENOUS PRESSURE MODIFIERS. Elevated CVP, with subsequent renal venous congestion, impairs renal function in the setting of decompensated HF, causing decreased kidney function and neurohormonal changes (25).

The classical study byMullens et al (26)  demonstrated that, in patients with decompensated advanced HF (baseline characteristics: mean age 54 AE 14 years, mean LVEF 20 AE 8%, cardiac index 1.9 AE 0.6 L/min/m 2 ), 40% developed worsening renal function (\"congestive kidney failure\") within the first 5 days of hospitalization. These subjects were more likely to have worse kidney function at baseline (serum creatinine 1.9 AE 0.9 mg/dL vs 1.5 AE 0.8 mg/dL; P \u00bc 0.007), and more importantly, the mean baseline CVP was significantly higher in the group that developed worsening kidney failure versus those who did not (18 AE 7 mm Hg vs 12 AE 6 mm Hg; P < 0.001)(26). Unexpectedly, the mean cardiac index was significantly higher in the group that developed worsening kidney failure. There are several investigational devices aiming to reduce renal afterload to increase renal blood flow, increase urine output and sodium excretion, and improve responsiveness to diuretics.The preCARDIA system (preCARDIA) consists of a pump console and a catheter that is introduced through the internal jugular vein and positioned into the pulmonary artery (PA)(16). A proprietary balloon located on the shaft of the catheter is positioned in the superior vena cava (SVC) above the junction of the right atrium (RA). This proprietary balloon is used to create intermittent mechanical occlusion as a therapeutic approach in significantly congested patients with acute decompensated HF(16). In contrast to inferior vena cava occlusion, SVC occlusion reduces preload and unloads the heart without reducing systemic blood pressure or cardiac output; no neurological or vascular injuries were reported after 12 to 18 hours of intermittent SVC occlusion(27). The net effect of the preCARDIA catheter is a reduction in CVP andsustained mean arterial pressure, thus creating improving hemodynamics and improving renal perfusion. An early open-label feasibility study is currently enrolling HF patients with NYHA functional class III to IV with inadequate diuresis with the objective of determining freedom from major adverse events throughout 30 days (NCT03836079). Preliminary data suggest a beneficial effect on cardiac output, diuresis, right atrial pressure (RAP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). The system has recently obtained the Breakthrough Device Designation by the Food and Drug Administration. The Doraya Renal Flow Regulator (Revamp Medical) is a temporary intravenous flow regulator that is percutaneously positioned in the inferior vena cava distal to the renal veins to partially restricts venous flow and reduce renal vein pressure (16). The device is introduced via the femoral vein using a 12-F sheath and consists of a 25-mm nitinol frame mounted on the distal portion of the catheter. Adjusting the opening of the frame allows for a partial obstruction of venous flow, decreasing preload and congestion and creating an iliac-to-CVP gradient of about 5 mm Hg. By decreasing congestion, the system is expected to achieve unloading of the renal venous system and improve perfusion pressure to the kidneys. A second effect is unloading of the LV, which results in reduced filling pressures and wall stress (28). Currently, an ongoing first-in-human study is evaluating the safety and performance of this device (NCT03234647). Early preliminary results from 5 enrolled patients have been promising, showing improvement in urine output and CVP; no serious adverse events associated with device placement or distal venous congestion were seen (29). The system was also granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the Food and Drug Administration in July 2020.INTERATRIAL SHUNTS FOR REDUCING PCWP DURING EXERCISEIn healthy individuals, cardiac output augments during exercise by increasing stroke volume (SV) and heart rate without an excessive increase in filling pressures. SV increases up to 40% as a result of both an increase in the LVEDV and a decrease in the LVESV, yielding a 15% absolute increase in LVEF(4,30). These mechanics depends on a compliant ventricle with normal early diastolic relaxation to avoid a significant increase in pressure at higher heart rate. Furthermore, in healthy individuals, the PCWP at peak supine exercise is <20 mm Hg and the LV enddiastolic pressure is almost invariably <25 mm Hg(31). In contrast, patients with HF (both HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF] and HFrEF) experience significantly elevated PCWP and LV enddiastolic pressure just by raising their legs and placing their feet in the pedals of a supine cycle, and these pressures raise even further after exercise is initiated (4,32,33). In HFpEF, in which exercise hemodynamics have been most extensively studied, up to 88% of the patients reach a mean PCWP of 35 mm Hg or greater at peak exercise (4,32). This increase in the wedge is associated with development of B-lines in thoracic ultrasound and a decrease in aerobic capacity (4,34). Some theoretical models explored the concept of an interatrial shunt for reducing this exercise-induced rise of PCWP to improve exercise tolerance (31). In one study, the contractile properties of each cardiac chamber were modeled by time-varying elastances in the model by allowing flow between the left atrium (LA) and RA, calculating the results that were obtained by varying the shunt diameter up to 12 mm (4). By creating a conduit in the interatrial septum, the pressure gradient between the LA and RA would potentially allow decompression of the left heart when the PCWP increases exaggeratedly during exercise. It was determined that the pressure gradient between chambers decreases as the shunt diameter increases, with the effect plateauing at around 10 mm (4). At peak exercise, the interatrial shunt model produced a decrease in LA pressure (LAP)-RAP gradient from 17 to 5 mm Hg, mainly owing to an 8-mm Hg decrease in LAP and a 3-mm Hg increase in RAP (4). At rest, the mean shunt flow was 1.4 L/min, corresponding to a Q p /Q s of 1.3. At peak exercise, the Q p /Q s was 1.4 with an average flow of 2.8 L/min. Moreover, the peak and mean PA pressures did not increase with the increased flow, owing to the reduction in LAP (4). Importantly, according to the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association congenital heart disease guidelines, congenital shunts of these sizes and Q p /Q s values in this range are unlikely to have deleterious effects on RV size, function, or pulmonary pressures (36). These guidelines have been used to rationalize the likely safety profile of this approach, an assumption that will need to be proved in long-term follow-up studies. Several devices are under development based on these data, aiming to improve clinical outcomes in HF and to improve symptoms by altering the LA and pulmonary hemodynamics via implantable devices (Figure 3). The V-Wave Shunt System (V-Wave) is a prosthesis built as an hourglass-shaped, self-expanding nitinol stent frame with an internal \"neck,\" which is placed across the fossa ovalis. The device is secured in place with the wide entry funnel located in the LA and the wide exit funnel in the RA. The entry funnel and the neck are encapsulated with polytetrafluoroethylene to limit tissue growth and to facilitate laminar flow (37). The device is implanted percutaneously under transesophageal echocardiography guidance via the right femoral vein. The initial version of the device had a valve, which is no longer present in the current version of the V-Wave. A first-in-human trial showed improvement in NYHA functional class, quality-oflife measures, 6-minute walk test distance, and PCWP (37). However, a longer-term follow-up revealed a 14% (n \u00bc 5 of 36) rate of occlusion and 36% (n \u00bc 13 of 36) rate of stenosis at 12 months (38)NCT03499236]) is actively recruiting patients to test if the device improves clinical outcomes in patients with NYHA functional class III and IVa symptoms, and is including patients with preserved and reduced LVEF; the only exclusion criterion is an LV end-diastolic dimension >8.0 cm. The IASD system (Corvia Medical) consists of a nitinol frame with a 19-mm outer diameter that creates a permanent 8-mm atrial septal shunt. As noted previously, the mathematical model described predicted that an 8-mm shunt diameter yields a Q p /Q s of 1.3. The device is implanted using a proprietary delivery catheter via the right femoral vein. The REDUCE LAP-HFI (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure I) I trial was a small (n \u00bc 44) randomized, sham-controlled trial that enrolled HFpEF patients showing significant benefit (P \u00bc 0.028) in decreasing peak PCWP during exercise (20, 40, and 60 W) at 1-month follow-up when compared with the sham control group, without any major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (39). That same population was subsequently followed for a longer term (median follow-up 739 days) and had a significantly better survival when compared with the predicted mortality as calculated using the MAGGIC (Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure) (40,41) prognostic score (3.4 per 100 patient-years vs 10.2 per 100 patient-years; P \u00bc 0.014) (42). A multicenter, randomized, triple-blinded (participant, care provider and outcomes assessor) controlled trial, the REDUCE LAP-HF II trial (NCT03088033), is ongoing. All of the intended 608 patients have been recruited, and patients are now in the follow up period, which will define the potential clinical benefits of the IASD system. The Atrial Flow Regulator (Occlutech) is another interatrial shunt device designed with the goal of trying to decrease LAP. It consists of a nitinol mesh device composed of 2 flat discs and a 1-to 2-mm connecting neck with a central fenestration allowing bidirectional flow. The device is manufactured with different fenestration sizes (6, 8, or 10 mm), and it is delivered following balloon atrial septostomy, as the Atrial Flow Regulator has less radial force than similar devices (43). The AFR-PRELIEVE (Pilot Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of a Novel Atrial Flow Regulator [AFR] in Heart Failure Patients) trial was a small (n \u00bc 36) prospective, nonrandomized, openlabel study enrolling NYHA functional class III or IV HFrEF and HFpEF patients with a 3-month follow-up that showed that the implant was safe and had few (n \u00bc 5 of 36) device-related complications. A single patient in the HFrEF group died 30 days after implant due to causes unrelated to the procedure (pneumonia and sepsis), and 3 of 36 patients were hospitalized due to worsening HF (43). The PROLONGER (Pomeranian atRial flOw reguLatOr iN conGestive hEart failuRe) trial (NCT04334694) is an ongoing nonrandomized, open-label trial that is currently enrolling patients. The study is designed to ascertain improvement in certain clinical (6-minute walk test, NYHA functional class) and hemodynamic outcomes (PCWP at rest and during handgrip test) after a 12month follow-up. The NoYa system (DiNoVa Medtech) is a stentless shunt system using a self-expanding nitinol stent that ablates the contacting tissue of the atrial septum using radiofrequency energy. The stent possesses adjustable strings that are used to adjust the diameter of the waist from 4 to 10 mm. The system creates an atrial septal defect without the need of an implantable component allowing future interventional procedures. Preliminary data from a first-in-human trial presented at TCT (44) showed significant improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and in 6-minute walk test distance. Finally, the Transcatheter Atrial Shunt System (Edwards Lifesciences) is a bare-nitinol implant flanked by 4 arms with an internal shunting diameter of 7 mm. Two arms situated on the LA wall, while the other 2 arms lie within the coronary sinus (CS). Intraprocedural CS multimodality imaging (angiography, fluoroscopy, transesophageal echocardiography, and hemodynamics) are done to verify appropriate device positioning and LA-to-CS shunting. A first-in-human trial was recently published by Simard et al (45), showing successful implant in 8 of 11 participants. After a median follow-up of 201 days, no major adverse periprocedural events were recor-",

It is clear that there will be a growing demand for physicians specifically trained in the implantation of these devices that can be attentive to the needs of the HF population. Some of these devices require more advanced skills (eg, the structural remodeling devices and interatrial shunts), while others require little more than the skills required to perform a right heart catheterization. The overall need is fostering training physicians specializing in \"interventional HF.\" Several of the technologies in development offer potential solutions to some of the specific unmet clinical needs of HF patients, and early clinical studies are providing encouraging results. These advances, along with advances in tissue engineering, pharmacology, and cardiac genetics may provide more comprehensive solutions to this syndrome affecting millions of patients worldwide.

            "text": "Novel Transcatheter-Based Therapies for Heart Failure multicenter, prospective, open-label, observational, single-arm trial of 1,200 patients with NYHA functional class III HF and a prior HF hospitalization within 12 months showed a reduction of HF hospitalization rates from 1.25 events per patient-year the year prior to enrollment compared with 0.54 events per patient-year the year following device implantation. This amounted to a risk reduction of 57% (HR: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.39-0.47; P < 0.0001) (47). Similar findings were noted in a registry study conducted in the European Union, with a 62% reduction of HF hospitalization the year following implantation compared with the year prior to implantation (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.31-0.48; P < 0.0001). All of these beneficial findings have stimulated industry to invest into the development of new monitoring technology (Figure 4), which will be reviewed subsequently. However, most recently the results of the prospective, randomized, single blind GUIDE-HF (Hemodynamic-GUIDEd Management of Heart Failure) study that included 1,022 primarily NYHA functional class II and III patients comparing HF management with and without knowledge of CardioMEMS readings reported no significant difference between groups (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74-1.05; P \u00bc 0.16) (48). Unfortunately, the study conduct was complicated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; a prespecified subgroup analysis assessing the result in the pre-COVID era showed a significant reduction of HF events in the active management group (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66-1.00; P \u00bc 0.049). During the COVID-19 era of the study, there was no treatment effect, and the rate of HF events decreased in the control group compared the active group (w0.55 events per patientyear), which did not change significantly from the pre-to post-COVID-19 eras. The implications of these findings to the adoption of pressure monitoring for HF patients remain to be seen. Nevertheless, as noted, there are several invasive monitoring technologies that remain under development. The Cordella PA Pressure Sensor System (Endotronix) is intended to measure, record, and transmit PA pressure from congestive HF NYHA functional class III patients to clinicians for evaluation and management, with the goal to improve clinical outcomes-mainly all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations or emergency department visits. The device is implanted via a right heart catheterization, using the femoral vein as access site, and positioning the sensor at the inferoposterior inflection of the right PA. A first-in-human trial demonstrated that the Cordella system enables the safe and accurate measurement of PA pressures in HF NYHA functional class III patients (49). No device system-related complications, defined as invasive treatment, device explantation, or death, occurred (49). Currently there are 2 ongoing trials to try to secure regulatory clearance in the United States (PROACTIVE HF IDE [PRO-ACTIVE-HF IDE Trial Heart Failure NYHA Class III] trial [NCT04089059]) and in the European Union (SIRONA II CE-Mark [SIRONA 2 Trial Heart Failure NYHA Class III] trial).The V-LAP LAP monitoring system (Vectorious Medical Technologies) is implanted across the interatrial septum, under angiographic and echocardiographic guidance, and transmits hemodynamic data to a secure cloud-based platform that allows for remote monitoring. The system consists of the leadless implant, a proprietary delivery system, and an external unit that powers the implant, collects data using radiofrequency, and transmits these data to the cloud.
