The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries.

There were reports of clusters of cases with unknown kinds of pneumonia with affiliation to the Huanan Animal wholesale food market (4) . Within few days, the Chinese Health Authority announced this disease to be caused by a novel Corona Virus named 2019-nCoV (5) which has 70% similarity to the human-derived Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 88% similarity to the bat derived SARS-CoV (4, 6) . As of March 22nd, 2020, the virus has spread to more than 187 countries and the total number of infected people are 294,110.

Patients outside China have a significantly higher proportion of symptoms of Diarrhea as shown in Figure 2H . This can be due to different environmental and social conditions of patients and further investigation can lead to important findings. Our analysis of shortness of breath shows that there wasn't much variation in reporting in all the studies except for Canada and the USA. Both countries have reported the highest shortness of breath. Further investigation can be done on reasons for the high proportion of shortness of breath reported by the patients of COVID-19 outside China. The fatality rate in China is significantly lower as compared to other countries. The highest fatality rate was found in the study conducted in the USA, with a fatality rate of 52% among 21 patients.
