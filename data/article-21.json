            "text": "and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19."

The scarcity of first-hand patient's dataset, limited information, and the ever-evolving situation created hurdles in analyzing COVID-19 patient's health characteristics. Moreover, some of the initial observational studies on the epidemiological characteristics of the patients reported mixed results (10) . For instance, Sun et al. (11) found that gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, are common among patients with COVID-19. However, early studies conducted by researchers in China didn't include digestive problems as the major health symptoms for COVID-19 (2, 9) . Therefore, in this study, we have conducted a meta-analysis of the observational research studies which were published in the first 3 months after the outbreak of COVID-19. We have analyzed the studies which have documented the epidemiological characteristics of patients infected by the COVID-19 virus, such as the patient's age, gender, major symptoms, and the fatality rate. The previously conducted meta-analysis have been geographically restricted to China and used a relatively smaller data set. According to the best of our knowledge, this metaanalysis is the first study that analyzes heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient's characteristics by comparing studies conducted in China and seven other countries. Therefore, this meta-analysis presents a timely synthesis of currently available observational studies on COVID-19."

(12) showed the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 infected patients based on eight studies from China. They also assessed that comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory system diseases are a risk factor for severe patients as compared to non-severe patients. Rodriguez-Morales et al. (10) included 19 studies in his meta-analysis. They compared the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, and dyspnea. They also assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 confirmed cases. They included 18 studies from China and only 1 from Australia. While Li et al. (13) did a meta-analysis based on 10 studies from Chinse hospitals. They also compared the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients including their age, fatality rate, and discharge rate. Therefore, our meta-analysis is different because we are presenting a comparison of the epidemiological characteristics of patients inside and outside of China."

We also confirm the findings of the previous meta-analyses that most patients had one or more reported comorbidities. However, the three most commonly reported symptoms, fever, cough, and shortness of breath are not reported in a similar proportion inside and outside China.

We also searched for observational studies on Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect on COVID-19 which were published after December 2019. After combining the papers from both sources, we identified a total of 2,251 research studies. We selected only those studies, which are observational and discussed epidemiological characteristics of patients, we also use the keyword search for \"symptoms, \" \"patient features, \" \"mortality, \" and \"epidemiological characteristics.\" These keywords filtering shortlisted our database to 90 articles. In these articles, most of the papers obtained the data from Wuhan China. We further shortlisted our search by selecting: the earliest data of COVID-19 in Wuhan, the latest data of Wuhan, data of different provinces of China, and COVID-19 data from different countries of the world. This brought down our data to 20 papers. During our search, we also encountered studies which were only conducted on the same patients, or specific types of patients, such as pregnant women, patients with gastrointestinal problems, or children having COVID-19. Since we are looking for studies with the general population so, these studies do not fit in our selection criteria and they may make our results biased. Therefore, our final selection of studies included 6 studies conducted in China and 7 studies from other countries of the world. The flow chart of the selection process is shown in Figure 1 ."

The dataset used in the study was from the patients who were admitted to the hospital between December 16th, 2019 to January 2nd, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. They found some patients had underlying diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. They also reported that all 41 patients had exposure to the Huanan seafood market, where this virus was originated first. Common symptoms reported by the authors were fever (98%), cough (76%), and fatigue (44%). The less common symptoms were sputum production (28%), headache (28%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). It also included Radiological reports and blood reports from the patients and comparison of reports of ICU and Non-ICU. Study 2 conducted by Li et al. (9) , included the first 425 confirmed cases till January 22nd, 2020 in the Wuhan, Hubei (17) , analyzed the demographical, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. The results of critical and non-critical patients were compared. The report showed the median age was 56 years with the range being 42-68 years old. It reported three common symptoms like fever, fatigue, and dry cough. The mortality rate reported was 4.3%."

A random-effect model was used since it was assumed that the symptoms of COVID-19 vary across the populations. The random effect model is a common model that is used to synthesize heterogeneous observations. It is simply the weighted average of the effect sizes of a group of studies which suggests that greater the variability in effect sizes (heterogeneity), the greater the un-weighting until all the studies have equal weight (28) . The presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies (Cochran's Q) and the extent of heterogeneity (I 2 index) were also examined. Along with the overall heterogeneity in studies, we analyzed heterogeneity in the sub-group for studies conducted in China and outside of China for each of the characteristics. The Forest Plots for all the analyses are listed in Figure 2 . The left column shows the overall results of the studies while the right column shows the comparison inside and outside of China."

            "text": "The understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients is an important research question. The researchers and medical professionals have tried to evaluate the data of patients to identify the most common symptoms which can be used as a yardstick in ruling out the disease while the patient is admitted to a hospital (7) . The few most common symptoms which were previously reported in observational studies are fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and nasal congestion (11) . In this study, we have analyzed the patient characteristics including, gender, age, fatality rate, and symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that the most commonly reported age group for COVID-19 is 45-60 years. A meta-analysis conducted by Yang et al. (12) , suggest that age and comorbidities are highly related in COVID-19 patients. We also found that the male population has a higher proportion in all the studies as shown in Figure 2A , suggesting a higher prevalence of the disease in the male population. The previous meta-analysis has found similar results while studying the gender in COVID-19 (10, 13) ."

            "text": "The comparison of studies conducted in China and outside China suggest contrasting and interesting results. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside China. However, we found the opposite results for the symptoms of Diarrhea. Patients outside China have a significantly higher proportion of symptoms of Diarrhea as shown in Figure 2H . This can be due to different environmental and social conditions of patients and further investigation can lead to important findings. Our analysis of shortness of breath shows that there wasn't much variation in reporting in all the studies except for Canada and the USA. Both countries have reported the highest shortness of breath. Further investigation can be done on reasons for the high proportion of shortness of breath reported by the patients of COVID-19 outside China. The fatality rate in China is significantly lower as compared to other countries. The highest fatality rate was found in the study conducted in the USA, with a fatality rate of 52% among 21 patients. Our findings also suggest that the fatality rate may increase as the virus spread in countries outside China, which also depends on the health facilities in different counties."

Also, the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath and cough only, but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also shown to be prevalent in patients with COVID-19. Our study is the first paper that has conducted a metaanalysis of patient's characteristics comparing observational studies conducted inside and outside China. The findings from this study can help medical and public health professionals as well as the public to better understand the symptoms associated with the COVID-19."
