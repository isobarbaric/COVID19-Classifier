Similarly, most respondents also reported interest in a website designed to specifically measure mood-related concerns and changes (172/206, 83.5%) [20] . Despite having interest in and motivation to use HITs to improve their health and well-being [20, 21] , some older adults still lack confidence in their ability to use web-based technologies [22, 23] . It has been demonstrated that older adults will only adopt new technologies when their apparent usefulness and usability outweigh concerns related to technological complexity and decreased social connection [24] . In light of these factors and age-related changes in cognition, vision, hearing, and perception, it is critical that HITs be tailored to the older adult community, taking into consideration their unique needs as users.",

As described in detail by Davenport et al [34] , the co-designed InnoWell Platform was developed through Project Synergy (by InnoWell) to collect information from multiple sources to formulate a comprehensive understanding of a consumer's needs and to monitor their progress over time. These sources comprise web-based, self-reported questionnaires assessing a range of health domains (ie, psychological distress, suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors, daily functioning, depressed mood, cognition, sleep-wake cycle, social connectedness) from both consumers and their health professionals and objective behavioral data collected via third-party integrations (eg, Fitbit trackers). The multifaceted and multidimensional assessment results are designed to be understandable directly by consumers and to be reviewed in collaboration with their health professional to promote shared decision making and collaborative care and to facilitate routine ",

Although HITs are not equivalent to in-person care, that is, \"Need face-to-face to establish trust for subsequent phone or emails\u2026you feel you know the person\" (Workshop 1) , it was noted that they provide improved access to care. For example, the convenience, that is, \"face-to-face is best, but over the phone is convenient\" (Workshop 1) and anonymity afforded by technology may \"be a good thing for people suffering mental health\u2026if it was face-to-face or someone they knew they would be less likely to do it at all\" (Workshop 3 However, the potential for misuse was also identified as \"over-notifications could feel like bullying\" (Workshop 1) or result in an \"obsession with the data\" by users (Workshop 1) . Data entry and tracking requirements were also viewed as a potential barrier to use, as it \"might be another stressor for some people\" (Workshop 3), particularly \"once they are unwell\" (Workshop 3).",

Importantly, facilitators were referenced far more frequently than barriers, potentially reflecting the interest in and increasing use of technologies to support health and well-being. The primary driver for use was personalization (ie, a tool that is designed to meet a consumer's requirements and that responds to the data entered by a consumer to meet a consumer's needs) as participants noted: Interestingly, the need for personalization was coupled with a desire for anonymity. It was suggested that the user \"could create a username\" (Workshop 1), with participants agreeing that \"the information going in is so sensitive that I would only do it anonymously\" (Workshop 1) . Furthermore, the ability to store health information in a personal data record, that is, \"it knows all my background\" (Workshop 3) was valued by participants. However, it is important to note that privacy and security risks were frequently referenced barriers as cybersecurity was characterized as \"an arms race...people employed in security are constantly trying to stay in front of the hackers\" (Workshop 1).",

Importantly, the preference for smartphones highlights a change in device use among older adults. Although previous studies have found that the use of home computers was nearly universal in a sample of older adults (93%), the use of smartphones was far less frequent (52%) [20] . The present results emphasize the rapid growth in smartphone ownership among older adults in recent years and the effect of aging [41] , with younger people with greater digital literacy and experience with technology moving into the older age group. For example, among Americans aged 65 years and older, ownership of smartphones increased from 23% in 2013 to 42% in 2016 [4] . It is important to recognize that device adoption varies considerably with age, education, and household income. The proportion of older adults who own a smartphone or tablet is markedly higher for those aged 65 to 69 years (59% and 41%, respectively) relative to those aged 75 to 79 years (31% and 28%, respectively) [4] . Similarly, individuals with higher levels of education (a bachelor's degree or beyond) are significantly more likely to have a computer and/or smartphone [20] . As such, consideration of the digital divide is crucial when considering technology use among older adults, as there may be barriers to access (eg, internet, smartphone) that preclude their engagement with web-based tools, including for, but not limited to, information and entertainment purposes and for the purposes of improving and maintaining health and well-being.",

The factors of well-being identified by participants align with the 6 components of the Ryff model of psychological well-being [42] , which includes self-acceptance, mastery of the environment, autonomy, positive relationships, personal growth, and life purpose.

However, this was balanced with a need to be self-reliant in maintaining one's well-being so as not to burden others. HITs have the potential to provide low-cost intervention and prevention tools that are designed specifically to target components of well-being [42] and symptoms of mental illness, such as anxiety, depression, and problematic health behaviors (eg, alcohol, gambling, and smoking). In fact, a meta-analysis found that apps were superior to control conditions in improving stress levels and quality of life and depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, with no marked difference relative to active interventions, including in-person treatment [45] .",

As evidenced by our participants, older adults will engage with social media to stay connected to family and friends; however, previous qualitative work in this area revealed that older adults prefer deep, thoughtful, one-on-one communications as opposed to the light-touch, group-based interactions promoted through social media [47] . These findings suggest that it is important to ensure that HITs are well integrated with the health care system, enabling the therapeutic relationship between a consumer and health professional as opposed to rendering it unnecessary. This may be a particularly important consideration for older adults who tend to experience greater degrees of social isolation and loneliness, which are known risk factors for health problems, including cognitive decline and depression [48] .",

Importantly, a systematic review of gamified cognitive assessment and training paradigms found evidence suggestive of associated improvements in engagement, intrinsic motivation, and training outcomes (when relevant) [51, 52] . In addition to promoting repeated engagement, gamifying cognitive tasks can improve usability, decrease test anxiety, and increase ecological validity [51] . Further research is now required to validate the application of game design principles to cognitive assessment to improve sensitivity to the earliest signs of decline and to cognitive training to promote engagement, real-world transfer, and sustainability of outcomes.",

To this end, HITs offer a viable alternative for those who prefer or are required to use digital health care due to health concerns (eg, during the COVID-19 pandemic) and geographic, transport, or mobility constraints. One of the marked discrepancies between our study and others that have investigated technology use for health-related purposes by older adults relates to familiarity with and confidence in using technology. Although this was not a personal concern among our participants, a lack of familiarity with technologies has frequently been cited as a potential barrier to adoption for older adults [53] , specifically in relation to web-based health care information seeking [54] . As referenced previously, consideration of the digital divide is crucial to ensure that those who may not have easy access to technology, or the skills required to use it, are not excluded from receiving mental health care delivered via HITs. Recommendations to bridge the digital divide include (1) technology subsidies for low-income consumers, (2) user-friendly technologies appropriate for consumers with physical disabilities and cognitive impairment; and (3) demonstrations and training opportunities for consumers who might not otherwise have the opportunity to learn how to use available technologies [55] .",

The role of a digital navigator is 3-fold: (1) evaluate HITs, such as apps, and make appropriate recommendations to health professionals; (2) set up technology and troubleshoot with the consumer, thereby allowing the health professional to focus on the clinical interaction with the consumer; and (3) interpret and report salient data collected by the HIT to both the consumer and the health professional in a user-friendly way to inform care and self-management. Although the current use of HITs among older adults is relatively low, this does not appear to be due to lack of interest [20] but rather due to the need for education and training in relation to the potential benefits of HITs and the practicalities of engagement with these technologies [57] . As such, a digital navigator has the potential to be particularly impactful for the older adult community, including both for consumers and their families and for health professionals.",

Although the assessment was not discussed per se, participants recognized that the more information that was input into the digital tool, including via interoperable devices, increased the likelihood of personalized feedback and recommendations. Furthermore, the ability to track and store data over time was valued by participants as a means to better understand what information, resources, and intervention strategies were associated with positive health outcomes based on personal goals relative to those that were not effective for the consumer. It was also recognized that a personal data record, only shared with health professionals with the consumer's permission, had the potential to facilitate coordinated care across health professionals and services and to prevent the need to retell one's story repeatedly to new providers. Although it was noted that HITs have the potential to improve access to services, particularly for consumers in regional or remote areas, there was consensus that HITs cannot and should not replace health professionals. Even when developed and delivered by a credible source, it was believed that HITs are not comparable with in-person care and that the connection with a health professional remains a valued part of seeking and receiving care. That said, participants consistently stated that they would make use of an HIT if asked to do so by a health professional.",

All informational materials provided within the InnoWell Platform are appropriate for older adults. For example, fact sheets are provided regarding the benefits of physical activity or the health impacts of excessive alcohol use for older adults. Furthermore, the care options embedded within the InnoWell Platform have been revised to reflect the needs of older adults, such as recommendations for apps for cognitive training, medication management, and cardiovascular health.

In addition, only 2 supportive others were included in the participant sample, thereby limiting any conclusions that can be drawn about the features or functions of HITs that may be appropriate specifically for this user group. Finally, to promote patient privacy, no demographic information was collected from participants; therefore, we were unable to comment on factors such as age range, highest level of education, or occupational status (eg, retired). This also precludes the ability to investigate differences in technology preferences based on age (eg, 50-64 years vs 65-80 years).",

Participants referenced personalization and the ability to access up-to-date, credible information and resources as primary facilitators of HIT adoption, with a strong desire for integration with standard care practices to preserve personal connections with health professionals. Data privacy and security risks were a primary barrier to HIT use, although this may be mitigated if the source of the digital tool is reputable. Variability in digital literacy among older adults also has the potential to limit the adoption of such tools. However, several strategies may improve uptake and efficacy, including active co-design of HITs specifically with the older adult community to ensure usability, acceptability, and appropriateness; support for HIT selection and use of clinical applications via a digital navigator; and education and training materials embedded within the HIT.",

Eighteen participants have enrolled in this study to date, and results are expected to be submitted for publication in early 2021. The findings will inform the iterative redesign and development of the InnoWell Platform before the implementation within an older adult health service setting. Furthermore, participant feedback will also be used in the design and development of other HITs for the older adult community, such as gamified cognitive tests to assess and monitor cognitive functioning over time and multifaceted, interactive web-based interventions to support and maintain mental health and well-being.",
