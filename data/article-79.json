However, there has been international concern in the medical community about pandemic risk due to aerosol transmission. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis by Memish et al to screen for nasal carriage of MERS-CoV in a large group of Hajj pilgrims has been an important advance in the public health response to MERS-CoV. However, we have a few methodological concerns about their study."

Furthermore, in a recent study, the median incubation period and serial interval (defined as the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) of MERS-CoV were found to be 5.2 days and 7.6 days, respectively [3] . Additionally, van Doremalen et al investigated the stability of MERS-CoV under different environmental conditions and reported that it can remain viable for 24-72 hours [4] ."

            "text": "In light of these findings, considering that the Hajj period can last up to 1 month and that a Hajj pilgrim may be infected with MERS-CoV during that period, it is possible that a small proportion of the Hajj pilgrims might have been infected and later recovered and, for this reason, had a negative PCR result during the post-Hajj screening. Therefore, it would have been more appropriate to screen the pilgrims during the pilgrimage period in addition to pre-Hajj and post-Hajj screening."
