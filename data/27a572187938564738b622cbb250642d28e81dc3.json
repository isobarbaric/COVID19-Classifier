Serological data, particularly when collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions, are a 15 key resource for addressing many key epidemiological questions since they directly quantify the proportion 16 of the population that has been infected by a pathogen 1, 2 . For SARS-CoV-2, serology is particularly useful given the high levels of disease under-ascertainment: serologic surveillance is the gold standard for 18 estimating attack rates (the proportion of the population that has been infected) and highly complementary 19 to virologic and syndromic surveillance systems for providing vital information on where a population is 20 along the epidemic curve 3 . Population-based serosurveys that employ a probabilistic sampling frame are 21 considered to be the gold standard for estimating seroprevalence. However, performing large population-22 based serosurveys can be prohibitively resource-intensive to initiate swiftly or perform repeatedly, 23 especially during an ongoing outbreak, as demonstrated by the relative sparsity of population-based vs. 24 convenience sampled serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 that have been conducted to date 3 . For example, to 25 date, no population-based serosurveys have been conducted for the city of San Francisco or wider Bay 26",

Relative to many 40 other US cities, few cases were detected in San Francisco during the early months of the epidemic, a pattern 41 which continued as the pandemic progressed. However, like many other areas, a high proportion of asymptomatic infections and limited access to diagnostic testing during this time makes it difficult to 43 interpret these numbers. Results from an early San Francisco seroprevalence study conducted on 44 convenience samples in late March to early April 2020 suggested that <1% of the population had been 45 infected overall 16 , in contrast to a seroprevalence of >6% estimated by a community study focusing on a 46 specific neighborhood, particularly among the Hispanic/Latinx population 17 .

This may be due to the limited availability of 255 PCR testing during the beginning of the pandemic and the lack of testing of asymptomatic individuals. We 256 also identified important disparities in seroprevalence at the neighborhood level, with highest 257 seroprevalence in the Bayview neighborhood in the southeast region of the city, as well as 258 disproportionately higher seroprevalence in individuals experiencing homelessness and those identifying 259 as Hispanic, Black/African American, or male.

Using EMR data, we were able to 303 develop a stratified sampling frame, ensuring improved representativeness of the results in contrast to 304 serosurveys performed using convenience samples without these key pieces of information 14 .

Samples with an ELISA concentration value above 118 0.049 were selected for confirmatory testing (see Supplementary Text 1). 119 120For confirmatory testing, we used a multiplex microsphere assay (Luminex platform) to detect IgG against 121 the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, RBD, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, based on a standardized serology 122 protocol with minor modifications 23 . Briefly, plasma samples were diluted to 1:100 in blocking buffer A 123 (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.02% sodium azide). Antigen concentrations 124 used were as follows: S: 4 ug/mL, RBD: 2 ug/mL, and N: 3 ug/mL. As above, concentration values were 125calculated from the Luminex median fluorescent intensity (MFI) using a plate-specific standard curve from 126 serial dilutions of a pool of positive control samples. A logistic regression model including the 127 concentration values of the three antigens for each sample was determined to have the highest cross-128 validation accuracy for classification, and was used to establish a cutoff for positivity (see Supplementary 129 Text 1). 130 131 Serologic assays were optimized using positive and negative controls from several sources. Serum samples 132 from 127 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (representing 266 total samples, with 1-4 133 longitudinal monthly time points per individual beginning at 3 weeks post-symptom onset) were obtained 134 from the Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) study 135 (https://www.liincstudy.org/) and used as positive controls. Importantly, participants in this cohort 136 represent a range of infection severities (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), age, sex, and ethnicity and 137 race. Serum samples from 119 individuals obtained prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 were used as 138 negative controls. The overall sensitivity of our serial testing approach using positive and negative controls 139 was 94.0% (95% CrI = 89.0%, 97.2%) and specificity was 99.8% ( 95% CrI = 98.2%, 100.0%) 140 (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Text 1). 141 Analytic Methods 144 Raw seropositivity was determined as the proportion of all samples from unique individuals that tested 145 positive on the confirmatory assay. We then produced estimates of seroprevalence adjusted for the 146 sensitivity and specificity of the serial testing approach, incorporating potential conditional dependence of 147 the tests as described in Gardner et al 24 (see Supplementary Text 1). We stratified by covariates to obtain 148 seroprevalence estimates for each stratum (age, sex, insurance status, ethnicity, and neighborhood). To 149 identify neighborhoods, we geocoded sample addresses using the Google Cloud Geocoding API 25 . Samples 150 (n=365 unique individuals) which could not be geocoded to rooftop (n=261) and/or were from homeless 151 individuals (n=157) were excluded from neighborhood level estimates of seroprevalence, however 152 estimates of seroprevalence were calculated for homeless individuals separately and provided alongside 153 neighborhood level estimates of seroprevalence. All analysis was conducted using the R statistical 154 software 26 and the Stan programming language 27 . Code and data to reproduce all analyses are available at: 155 https://github.com/EPPIcenter/scale-it. 156 157 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 158This study received expedited review approval by the UCSF IRB #20-30379 ('Serological Surveillance of 159 SARS-CoV-2 in Residual Serum/Plasma Samples'). The IRB did not require patient contact or written 160 consent to use residual sera. The LIINC study (providing positive control samples) was approved by the 161 UCSF (IRB #20-30479). Pre-pandemic samples used as negative controls came from the New York Blood 162Bank, and were de-identified and not subject to IRB review for use in this study.",

Our results were relatively representative of the San Francisco population by race and ethnicity, 172 although our sample overrepresented those who identified as Black/African American and slightly 173 underrepresented those who identified as Asian. 174 175 Overall, from 5,244 samples we identified 192/4,735 positive samples from unique patients for a raw 176 seroprevalence of 4.1%. After weighting for age group and sex to match the population structure of San 177 Francisco and correcting for test performance characteristics (overall sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity 178 of 99.6%), this corresponds to an estimated population seroprevalence of 4.2% (95% Credible Interval 179",
