            "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic spread into the U.S. and global healthcare system in February and March of 2020, hospitals rapidly adjusted to care for the influx of infected patients [1] [2] [3] . This redirection created a reduced capacity to perform operations and an overall dramatic but transient decrease in surgical volumes at most hospitals, including neurosurgical procedures [4] [5] [6] . With limited ICU beds and the concern of viral transmission between patients and caregivers, many hospitals stopped non-emergent neurosurgical procedures for several weeks or months early in the pandemic then gradually resumed as COVID-dedicated wards were established [7, 8] . While this unforeseen crisis delayed care for many patients, it provided an opportunity and call to action for further streamlining safe and efficient brain tumor care. Surgery for primary and secondary brain tumors by craniotomy or endonasal transsphenoidal removal is resource intensive and has historically required multi-day hospital admissions, often including initial recovery in the ICU [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . For over a decade, our center has been using minimally invasive approaches, complication avoidance protocols, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and early postoperative imaging to optimize outcomes and shorten LOS in patients with brain, skull base and pituitary tumors [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The pandemic-induced scarcity of ICU and monitored beds at our hospital, further forced our clinicians and administrators to develop accelerated timelines and safety protocols from admission to discharge, so that brain tumor patients with evolving neurological deficits or endocrinopathies could be treated expeditiously."

They were also told that timely discharge was in their best interest so they could be home with family members, and in turn would free-up beds for patients with COVID-19 or other critical illnesses. Specifically, most supratentorial brain tumor patients were told they would likely go to a stepdown unit bed and be ready for discharge home on POD#1 provided they awoke well from surgery and their CT scan from the recovery room demonstrated expected findings. Similarly, endonasal surgery patients with pituitary adenomas and Rathke's cleft cysts were told that they would be admitted to a step-down unit bed and would likely be able to go home on POD#1. Patients with more complex tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, skull base meningiomas and posterior fossa tumors were told a decision of ICU versus step-down unit and discharge day would be based on clinical status in recovery room and post-operative CT, but that a POD#1 discharge was quite possible."

For the craniotomy cohort, ICU utilization decreased from 80% to 33% and for the endonasal cohort, hospital LOS of 1 day or less increased from 15% to 58%. No patient who was initially monitored in the stepdown unit required transfer into the ICU. The two cohorts had similar rates of tumor resection/ remission, surgical complications, readmissions and reoperations. Winston Churchill is credited with saying \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" As U.S. healthcare gradually emerges from the pandemic, many aspects of surgical care, including how we prepare patients for surgery and where and how they recover will be forever altered. In our experience, the pandemic forced us to reconsider some basic assumptions about brain tumor care and acted as an accelerant to rapidly implement protocol changes that we had already been using on a more limited basis. In managing patients with benign and malignant brain tumors, skull base tumors and pituitary tumors, several factors can facilitate safe and early discharge and reduce ICU usage. Five of these factors were already integrated into our perioperative protocols ( Table 1 ). The pandemic encouraged us to go further in terms of having i) more rigorous patient preparation and education, ii) more rigorous assessment in the recovery room for need of ICU monitoring and gaining a team comfort level of admission to a stepdown unit bed, iii) focused care team engagement to encourage and facilitate early discharge, iv) earlier postoperative patient mobilization, and v) early patient follow-up post-discharge."

The endoscopic endonasal route is now a well-accepted approach for many midline skull base and parasellar non-pituitary tumors. In our experience and that of others, using smaller incisions with more focused craniotomies, or the natural endonasal corridor facilitate less brain exposure, rapid healing, reduced pain need for narcotics, and a greater willingness for patients to mobilize and leave the hospital soon after surgery [15, 17, 31, 33, [39] [40] [41] . Similarly, strict complication avoidance protocols help facilitate short LOS, reduced ICU use, and lower overall complication rates [42, 43] . For example, the measures we routinely employ of surgical navigation, Doppler ultrasound for vessel localization, endoscopy for maximizing visualization and strict skull base closure protocols to avoid CSF leaks in aggregate are associated with a low rate of new neurological deficits (1%, 3/317 operations) and a low CSF leak rate of 1.2% (4/317 operations) with no cases of meningitis [16, 17] ."

Similarly, reduced narcotic use in the early perioperative period aim to help patients be more cognitively alert and physically active. In this cohort, there was only one case of DVT and no PEs, MIs or 30-day surgical mortalities. The low rate of thromboembolic events is likely due in part to the high functionality of patients with early ambulation and limited perioperative narcotic use and compares favorably to the 2.7-4.1% incidence recently published [45, 46] ."

However, the protocol we implemented early in the pandemic allowed us to still bring patients to surgery and rapidly and safely discharge them. We postulate, as others have shown, that more extensive patient education and expectation management of their ability to safely leave the hospital helped in this effort [47, 48] . Patient motivation in minimizing their hospital stay has helped facilitate these changes, which would have previously been met with a level of reluctance. Having the entire care team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, recovery room staff, intensivists, ICU and step-down unit nursing staff and hospital administration engaged in this goal was likely critical in favorably reducing ICU utilization and LOS."
