Medical health workers showed higher prevalence rates of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p = 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01) than nonmedical health workers. Medical health workers also had higher total scores of ISI (p < 0.01), GAD-2 (p < 0.01), PHQ-2 (p = 0.01), and on the SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptom scale (p < 0.01) than nonmedical health workers. Each item of ISI (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05), GAD-2 (p < 0.01), and PHQ-2 (p = 0.01) was significantly elevated in medical health workers compared with nonmedical health workers. On the SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptom scale, 6 of the 10 items had higher scores in medical health workers than in nonmedical health workers. In the SCL-90-R somatization symptoms scale, 3 of 12 items, including questions 1 (headaches) (p = 0.01), 4 (faintness or dizziness) (p < 0.01), and 48 (trouble getting your breath) (p < 0.01), had higher scores in medical health workers than in nonmedical health workers. No difference on phobic anxiety between both groups was found ( Table 2) ."

            "text": "Medical health workers during the COVID-19 epidemic had high prevalence rates of severe insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. They also had risk factors for developing insomnia, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization. Thus, the presence of these symptoms in addition to the life status of daily fighting against COVID-19 suggests that they must cope with psychological distress and are at risk of allostatic overload [9] . Indeed, according to clinimetric criteria, allostatic overload can be diagnosed in the presence of a current identifiable source of distress in the form of recent life events and/or chronic stress; the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual coping skills when its full nature and full circumstances are evaluated. In addition, the stressor is associated with difficulty in falling asleep, restless sleep, early morning awakening, lack of energy, dizziness, generalized anxiety, irritability, sadness, demoralization; significant impairment in Psychother Psychosom DOI: 10.1159/000507639 social or occupational functioning; and feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life [9] . The reasons for the psychological distress to which medical health workers were exposed might be related to the many difficulties of being safe at work, such as the initially insufficient understanding of the virus, the lack of prevention and control knowledge, the long-term workload, the high risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, the shortage of medical protective equipment [13, 23] , the lack of getting rest [24] , and the exposure to critical life events [25] , such as death. Exemplifications of such a distress are: (1) 16 of the 100 nurses at the Pohang Medical Center in North Gyeongsang Province resigned due to overwork among the COVID-19 epidemic [26] ; (2) > 3,000 medical health workers in (Wuhan) Hubei Province were infected with COVID-19 at a very early stage (before and in January of 2020). Later, with continuously updated guidelines on how to handle the patients with COVID-19 [27] , with rest in shifts for medical staff, with rapid supply of medical protective items (including masks, glasses, and suits), and with training on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for all medical staff [24] , no doctors have been infected with COVID-19 among about 40,000 medical personnel from the nation supporting Hubei medical services [24] ; and (3) as of the 20th March, 5 medical health workers in one hospital of Wuhan died due to being infected with COVID-19 [28] ."

Undoubtedly, these risk factors might endure allostatic overload and favor the development of psychopathology, including chronic insomnia [29] . Independent factors (i.e., currently having organic disease, living in rural areas, being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients in hospitals, or being female) were common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms among medical health workers. When faced with the same COVID-19 during the fight against the epidemic, medical health workers in rural areas might worry about being infected due to a different working place involving different medical skills and medical conditions. In contrast, the medical conditions in urban areas were often much better. Thus, different directions on caring for the medical health workers might be possible."

This may support medical staff in adapting to the working environment quickly and maintain a better mental and health balance to be able to work. Lowering job demands and workload [31] , while increasing job control and reward might help to protect medical health workers. Individual interventions adequate for medical staff in the current situation, where they wear medical protective equipment which cannot be removed during work time, are still unknown. Story sharing [32] would be important as well as reinforcing the positive assets of persons [33] . Simple, easy, practical methods are needed.

First, a cross-sectional design was applied although a longitudinal approach might help verifying whether allostatic overload develops (exhaustion may ensue after some time) and whether psychiatric disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, might occur with the COVID-19 progression. Second, psychological assessment was based on an online survey and on self-report tools. The use of clinical interviews is encouraged in future studies to draw a more comprehensive assessment of the problem. Third, it is not possible to assess the participation rate since it is unclear how many subjects received the link for the survey."
