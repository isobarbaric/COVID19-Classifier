Understanding the reasons for these differences is critical in determining how to ease restrictive nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) without causing disease resurgence until vaccines are widely distributed. There are numerous factors that could drive these differences across countries, including population age structure, contact patterns, population density, seasonality, pre-existing exposure to other coronaviruses, comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, healthcare and testing capacity, and intervention policies. Previous studies suggest that in LMIC, any benefits from factors like younger populations (due to lower susceptibility and infectiousness) may be negated by factors such as limitations in surveillance and healthcare capacity. If true, NPI timing and stringency could be expected to explain differences in COVID-19 burden across income settings.",

The model indicated that COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines can be explained by age, contact structure, mobility, and adherence to public health policies. The Minimum Health Standards policy, which requires people to adopt a suite of personal protective behaviors, has played a substantial role in reducing transmission in the Philippines. However, low testing capacity, the limited proportion of the population recovered from infection (modelled), and high sensitivity to easing policies, are likely to be important factors in determining the potential for disease resurgence.",

While numerous demographic, political, and socioeconomic factors are hypothesised to affect disease transmission, the results of this study suggest that, prior to the introduction of variants of concern, the apparent lower burden of disease in the Philippines was driven by younger populations, contact structure, and policy. Using the Philippines as a case study, which experienced a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak for a LMIC, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs and personal protective behaviors in curtailing transmission and found that personal protective behaviors have likely reduced disease burden considerably. This study therefore provides evidence of a low-cost, effective intervention policy that could be adopted by other countries to prevent disease resurgence while vaccines are distributed.",

Multiple demographic and socioeconomic factors likely drive differential COVID-19 burden across income groups, both within and among countries. Expansive population pyramids and tropi-cal climates may reduce COVID-19 transmission and severe disease in many LMIC [3] [4] [5] , while high contact rates, high prevalence of comorbidities, high population densities, and limited healthcare capacity could increase burden [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . While many LMIC have had lower COVID-19 burdens than HIC, weak surveillance systems 11 could also affect epidemic estimates. Nonetheless, understanding why many LMIC have had apparently less severe outbreaks could help other countries better control their epidemics until vaccines are widely distributed.",

For countries rolling out vaccines, easing NPIs too early could jeopardize success 18 . However, for the majority of the world's population, particularly those living in LMIC, vaccine access and delivery is limited 19 and widespread vaccination coverage may take two or more years 17 , 20 . Thus, with or without vaccines, understanding the effectiveness of NPIs that can curtail COVID-19 transmission is critical. There are three broad categories of NPIs, those that aim to: (i) isolate infected individuals and their contacts; (ii) reduce contact between infected and susceptible people (henceforward \"macrodistancing\"); and (iii) reduce transmission given contact between infected and susceptible people (henceforward \"microdistancing\"). Most HIC have enforced initiatives for all three types of NPIs with a focus on long, strict macrodistancing interventions through stayat-home orders. LMIC have also employed macrodistancing policies but often with shorter, less strict orders because these types of initiatives exacerbate poverty and have societal costs 21 , 22 that LMIC cannot withstand (although some LMIC like China enforced strict, short-term macrodistancing policies that led to successful disease suppression). Relaxing of short-term macrodistancing policies would be expected to lead to disease resurgence 23 , which runs counter to the experience of some LMIC. A meta-analysis indicates that inexpensive microdistancing policies (e.g., properly wearing face masks) can be highly effective 24 and therefore could explain why some LMIC are continuing to suppress transmission after an initial period of macrodistancing.",

Here we investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines during the first wave of transmission and the effectiveness and sensitivity to microdistancing policies. The Philippines is a LMIC that, during the first epidemic wave, had over 580,0 0 0 confirmed cases and more than 12,0 0 0 deaths, with a peak in incidence in August 2020; at time of writing, the Philippines is undergoing a subsequent second, more severe wave of transmission that is not assessed in this study. Various NPIs have been implemented in the country, with the timing and level of restriction varying by region. The NPIs implemented include different levels of community quarantines, including school closures 28 . Between October 2020 and March 2021, the Philippines shifted from a focus on community quarantine orders towards greater reliance on Minimum Health Standards (MHS) policies, requiring the proper use of face coverings, physical distancing, and hand hygiene. To gain insights into the Philippines epidemic during the first wave of transmission, we present a datadriven COVID-19 model, which includes age structure, heterogeneous contact patterns, time-varying testing rates, and macro-and microdistancing. We use this model to 1) estimate epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 in the Philippines; 2) consider the effects of NPIs implemented during the first wave of transmission; and 3) create scenarios for various policy changes and estimate associated risk of disease resurgence. Stratification by infection and detection status (same colour scheme as in A) for actively infectious exposed and infected compartments. (D) Heterogeneous mixing matrices by age in the absence of NPIs (brighter colours indicate higher average number of contacts per day). (E) Community quarantine driven mobility adjustments applied to the mixing matrices (before seven-day moving average smoothing). Other locations include average from retail and recreation, supermarket and pharmacy, parks, and public transport. We provide panels A and E for the regional models in Fig. S4 .",

To gain insight into the first wave of transmission in the Philippines, we used time series data from 1 March 2020 to 23 February 2021. We aggregated these data across all age groups (for data sources where age was available), because data were sparse for certain age groups and > 20 0 0 records were missing age information. For number of tests, ICU occupancy, and deaths, we used daily data from the Republic of the Philippines Department of Health COVID-19 Data Drop ( https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker ). We aggregated test data from multiple laboratories (we list the laboratory facilities associated with each region in Table S6 ). For daily confirmed cases, we used the Department of Health COVID-19 Philippines Local Government Units Monitoring Platform ( https: //fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/ ). Lab facilities in the Philippines confirmed cases by RT-PCR and we calculated daily cases based on report date. To account for differences between weekday and weekend reporting, we smoothed daily confirmed cases using a seven day moving average.

We used three sources of local data as calibration targets: total daily confirmed cases and the most recent estimate of ICU occupancy and cumulative deaths (806 and 11523 respectively for the national model). Although we calibrated the model to these three targets simultaneously, we prioritized confirmed cases in the calibration process because these data are considered the highest quality in the Philippines for COVID-19 (based on advice from local health officials), while limiting the use of ICU and mortality data to the most recent values, as the quality of these data improved over time. We simultaneously fit the model to the three calibration targets using an adaptive Metropolis algorithm 33 ( Table 2 ; supplemental material). For the prior distributions of epidemiological calibration parameters, we used uniform priors for highly uncertain quantities and truncated normal distributions for quantities informed by epidemiological evidence ( Table 2 ; supplemental material). To account for potential differences between HIC and LMIC, we included \"adjuster\" parameters to modify the proportion of symptomatic individuals, proportion of symptomatic individuals hospitalised, and the infection fatality rate (which are based on estimates from HIC). The adjuster values are multiplicative factors applied to the odds ratio, where an adjuster value of one would indicate no adjustment is needed, a value below one would indicate the parameter is lower in the Philippines, and a value above one would indicate the parameter is higher in the Philippines. To calibrate the model, we ran seven independent chains with approximately 10 0 0 0 iterations per chain and discarded the first 200 iterations as burn-in. We evaluated convergence and autocorrelation through visual inspection of trace plots and autocorrelograms respectively, and calculated effective sample sizes. We used Latin Hypercube Sampling across the multidimensional parameter space to select initial parameter conditions. We structured the model, calibration data, likelihood function, and priors identically for the national and regional models. We report the model outputs as median estimates with 25-75 and 2.5-97.5 credible interval percentiles to show uncertainty.",

Younger populations typical of LMIC may reduce disease burden in two ways: 1) a proportionally smaller percent of the We calibrated the national model to daily confirmed cases (black dots; same in both plots), which included MHS (left) and ran a counterfactual scenario that did not include MHS (right). The MHS effect value (i.e., reduced transmission risk per contact) is squared in the model to account for the reduction in the probability of an infected person passing on the infection and the probability of a contact being infected, prior to adjustment of each cell of the mixing matrix. We provide results for the regional models with and without MHS in Figs.

More intergenerational contacts in LMIC may also lower disease burden because elderly people often reside with family rather than in aged-care facilities, which have driven outbreak clusters in many HIC (e.g., [37] ). An important finding of this study is that adherence to MHS appeared largely responsible for limiting transmission in the Philippines while gradually easing quarantines during the first epidemic wave. These results were consistent across regions (i.e., all models presented in this paper) that span a wide population density gradient, suggesting that this approach is effective in both rural and urban areas and could also be effective in other similar settings. It is possible that the effect of MHS is a surrogate for other time-varying processes, however, local experts within the Philippines provide strong intuition that MHS is responsible for driving the patterns we found. In addition, we are not aware of any other processes than those modelled that could be responsible for these patterns. These types of personal protective measures will likely continue to be needed throughout 2021 and potentially 2022, depending on the speed of vaccine distribution.",

Local expert opinion suggests the second wave is mainly occurring in the National Capital Region and parts of Calabarzon and are driven by new variants of concern 34 , which are more transmissible and lethal 38 . Further, increases in mobility, due to relaxed interzonal travel requirements, and lower compliance to MHS (which could be attributable to over-confidence in disease control and fatigue with personal protective behaviors), provides more transmission opportunities. The results of this study provided real-time weekly updates of the model outputs through the first wave directly to policy-makers through the Department of Health COVID-19 Philippines Local Government Units Monitoring Platform ( https: //fassster.ehealth.ph/covid19/ ) and indicated that, in the absence of new variants, relaxing societal restrictions like work-from-home orders were not predicted to cause substantial disease resurgence.

Thus, prior to the introduction of disease variants, MHS may have been sufficient to sustain suppression of transmission as a bridge to broad scale vaccination. Although not modelled in this study, the increased transmissibility of the new variants may be broadly comparable to the reduction in transmission gained by MHS adherence. Therefore, these measures may no longer be sufficient to suppress transmission as strain replacement occurs, although they would still help alleviate burden on the health care system. Recent disease resurgence in the Philippines demonstrates the need for sustained non-pharmaceutical interventions until vaccines are widely distributed. Limited testing is another major obstacle for the Philippines 39 and many other LMIC and can hinder both public health response and our understanding of the epidemic.",

            "text": "There are several important limitations relevant to interpreting the model results, including modelling assumptions, data limitations, and uncertainty. Most epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 used in this study were estimated from HIC (or China). While we included \"adjuster\" parameters to allow the symptomatic proportion, hospitalisation, and mortality rates to vary for the Philippines (similar to [40] ), these parameters were not well constrained by the data. We assumed that other parameters were similar to HIC, which may be inaccurate. However, most parameter estimates appear reasonable given previously reported COVID-19 epidemiology in the Philippines 26 . When more data become avail-able from the Philippines or similar settings, the current model can be updated with new parameter values. Data issues made modelling and understanding the epidemic in the Philippines particularly challenging, although data quality has progressively improved through time. For example, additional ICU facilities were created specifically for COVID-19 in the Philippines and were not required to report usage, likely affecting these estimates, especially early in the epidemic. Similarly, daily deaths, which are often considered the most reliable epidemic indicator internationally, have fluctuated markedly over the course of the epidemic, often peaking at times that appear contradictory to patterns of confirmed cases. Although reporting of daily deaths appears unreliable, cumulative deaths align reasonably well with the model projections of mortality without significant modification to the internationally estimated infection fatality rate. Finally, there is uncertainty around all model parameters, with some parameters less well constrained than others (e.g., case detection rate), which highlights the need for more epidemiological information. Future studies could build on this effort by including new, more robust data sources for model parameters and calibration targets.",
