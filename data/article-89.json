            "text": "Mashhad, Iran. Vegetation in the park was sampled along 41 random 10-m transects with different human disturbances (trails, dirt roads, campsites) and undisturbed communities. Life form spectrum, species composition, species and phylogenetic diversity were determined for all communities. Disturbance increased the frequency of therophytes, but decreased the frequency of chamaephytes and percentage vegetated area. Recreational-mediated disturbance had variable impact on species composition, but decreased species and phylogenetic diversity compared with undisturbed areas. Roads and campsites caused the greatest damage, while trails had the smallest negative impact on vegetation. This study showed that damage to (semi-)natural park vegetation differs with recreation activity. This finding can help prioritise management activities to minimise negative impacts of recreation activities on local vegetation. The current visitor load to the urban park studied here appears too high to be sustainable over time, so better monitoring and restrictions on visitor numbers may be needed to minimise the negative impacts on park vegetation. The camping impacts can be managed by creating clusters of designated campsites to spatially concentrate the impact area. Lowimpact practices should be communicated to visitors."

Among outdoor activities, hiking and camping are popular worldwide 3 . There is a large body of literature describing the adverse effects of these two activities on natural vegetation and soil in different regions [4] [5] [6] . Frequently reported negative impacts of hiking and camping on the vegetation in recreation destinations include changes in species composition, reduced biodiversity, shorter vegetation, more patches of bare soil and complete removal of vegetation 2, 4, 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recreation activities are a major source of disturbance in arid regions, and their impacts on arid ecosystems are poorly understood [11] [12] [13] . There is a geographical bias in recreation ecology studies, with few published reports from developing countries 6, 14 . Moreover, impacts of recreation vary greatly as a response to disturbance intensity and vegetation type 15 . Managers in developing countries have to refer to studies in other parts of the world with a different evolutionary history of natural ecosystems and thus the results can be misleading for these managers, especially in preparing a proper conservation programme 2, 14 . An appropriate management strategy should preserve recreation values to enhance positive social impacts 16 ."

It is also among the most visited religious cities in the world 19 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ numbers of visitors (residents and tourists), especially during the holiday period. These destinations are located in the Khorassan-Kopet Dagh floristic province, which falls within the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot and is home to many range-restricted endemic species. Only around 8% of the Khorassan-Kopet Dagh is officially protected, while remaining parts are generally unregulated 21 . In a study on an environmentally friendly managed ski-piste located 70 km from Mashhad, Erfanian et al. 24 concluded that appropriate management of this recreation destination could help restore the natural vegetation in areas with a long history of heavy grazing. To our knowledge, there have been no other published studies about recreation destinations in Mashhad and nearby areas. The aim of the present study was to fill this research gap. The area selected for the study was a mountainous urban park (Khorshid Park) in Mashhad where recreation activities are not regulated. As a result, its vegetation has been affected by multiple recreational activities for a decade. The hypothesis tested was that different recreation activities shape plant communities in the study area and that recurrent disturbances lead to severe vegetation disturbance. The specific objective was to quantify the disturbances caused by each recreational activity carried out in the study area (hiking, camping, driving on dirt roads). The investigations performed were necessary because characterising the environmental impacts of these disturbances is the first step in devising a suitable management programme."

The park was established in 2007 to provide a recreation destination for trekkers, mountaineers and campers 25 . It is located on the north-facing slope of the Binalood Mountains, a major mountain range within the Khorassan-Kopet Dagh floristic province 21 . The area is characterized by a Mediterranean xeric oceanic bioclimate 26 . Khorshid Park is the access route to Zou peak, the highest peak in the Mashhad. Dirt and asphalt roads have been constructed within the park, to allow access to campsites and trails. The most intensively used area within the park is a camping zone in the lower part of the park. Camping occurs along the roads. Khorshid Park is one of the main recreation destinations for residents and for pilgrims to Mashhad. This park hosts around 10,000 daily visitors in general and over 75,000 daily visitors during the holidays 25 . Different recreation activities of these visitors induce disturbances that affect the vegetation in the park. At the time of the study, the park was managed solely for recreational purposes, and not to ensure the conservation of flora and fauna in the area."

The study area had homogenous vegetation before the park was established and there is no evident environmental factor in the area that could lead to vegetation heterogeneity. The natural vegetation of the area was sampled along 10-m transects, in which there were no tree species. Considering the nature of the disturbances occurring in the park (i.e. trails, dirt roads, campsites), a line-intercept sampling method was used 28 . Disturbed plant communities were identified as those located within 1 m of the disturbance source. Random transects, running in parallel with the disturbance sources, were sampled at 30 cm distance from trails, dirt roads (hereafter 'roads') and campsites. To compare the disturbed communities with (semi-)natural communities, control transects lying well away from any disturbance source were used. These control transects were randomly sampled in areas with no sign of any disturbances. A total of 41 transects (10 control, 10 trail, 10 road and 11 campsites) were studied. No transects were located under the canopy of the planted trees. Along each transect, all species of vascular plants and vegetation cover were recorded. The life form of each species was identified based on the Raunkiaer classification system 28 ."

Here, the median of the total vegetation cover of the control transects was used as a base, and percentage change in vegetation cover of other groups relative to that value was calculated. Box plots comparing these values were drawn in R. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the total vegetation cover of the groups.

A non-significant decrease in species diversity of heath vegetation near trails in alpine Sweden has been reported previously 47 .

The camping impact can be managed by creating car campgrounds or clusters of designated campsites. These could be placed in areas that are more sustainable, which would help spatially concentrate the area of camping impact. A camping containment strategy could be used in the park. Low-impact practices (i.e. 'Leave No Trace') should be communicated to visitors.

The results showed that different recreation-related disturbances (hiking trails, campsites, dirt roads) have negative impacts on the (semi-) natural vegetation in the area. The results also revealed the importance of considering phylogenetic diversity when assessing the impacts of recreation activities on plant communities. The main impacts identified here should be targeted in future monitoring and protection programmes for Khorshid Park. Other recreation destinations in Mashhad city and throughout Iran should also be monitored and managed."
