Many governments of the world have accelerated an adoption of public policies to address this crisis; however, a trade-off between the economy and public health exists. Previous studies in this area have mainly focused on the impact of COVID-19 on human life and the environment. This work adds to the literature by analyzing how individual environmental concern can affect citizens' preferences for public policies that deal with COVID-19. A data set of 26,131 participants from 26 countries was used to test the research model. Results indicate that environmental concern is positively associated with a preference for long-term oriented altruistic policies, and it shapes the relationship between economic and health problems at the country level on our dependent variable.",

Also, both individual-level and country-level characteristics affect citizens' preferences for policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This shock is comparable to other fatal historical events such as the Great War (21.5 million deaths) or the Vietnam War (2.5 million deaths). Like these other important incidents, COVID-19 has affected all aspects of everyday life for most people and it has heavily impacted the global economy and national health systems. To cope with the consequences of COVID-19, many governments of the world have increased public spending to boost recovery. For instance, the European Commission (EC) created the largest stimulus package ever financed in Europe to help the continent rebuild after COVID-19: a total of \u20ac1.8 trillion has been budgeted (European Commission, 2021) . This financial instrument is designed not only to deal with the short-term economic effects of COVID-19, but also to improve health policies (e.g., scientific research or new health programs) and to develop more altruistic policies based on social and environmental protection (e.g., fighting climate change or tackling social inequality) in the long-term.",

            "text": "These policy aims (long-term altruistic vs. short-term and less altruistic) are often framed as opposites in public discourse, and many citizens perceive them as such (EPRS, 2020) . Therefore, in order to re-balance this perception toward a more eco-social political economy-oriented perspective, an in-depth analysis of the factors that underlie preference for long-term altruistic policies is required. This knowledge can assist policymakers in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f achieving a more inclusive and sustainable economy and society after the crisis of COVID-19 subsides. This may be even more relevant in the European Union, which represents a political and economic union of 27-member states, and where accepting longterm altruistic policies may be crucial to guarantee the success of the Union. Specifically, policy preference is defined as \"an evaluative attitude of preferring, liking, agreeing with, and being 'for' a given policy\" (PytlikZillig et al., 2018, p. 91) . A plethora of individual, psychological, and contextual factors influence an individual's policy preference (Margalit, 2013) . Therefore, contextual factors such as COVID-19-related public health and economic problems in a country may have an influence on this preference for longterm altruistic policies. For example, in Spain, where dramatic effects on the economy have been observed due to COVID-19 consequences, a significant proportion of public opinion supports the idea that short-term economic measures should be valued above long-term ones focused on health and social issues (Olmos, 2020) . Furthermore, individual characteristics such as age, gender, or educational level may also determine a preference for long-term altruistic policies.",

As a result of these similarities, several researchers have focused on how to link COVID-19 with the effort to protect the environment, mainly by analyzing the effects of the pandemic on natural and environmental management (see e.g. Elsaid et al., 2021; Hantoko et al., 2021) . However, an important and unexplored question that arises in this context is whether environmental perception also plays a role in the preference for long-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f term altruistic policies. It has been demonstrated that some restrictive policies for controlling the coronavirus (e.g., compulsory quarantines and lockdown) have had positive consequences on the environment (Elsaid et al., 2021) . However, these measures have also had negative effects on the economy (World Bank, 2020) . This vision of incompatibility between policies can foster a rejection of socio-environmental policies, which are more long-term oriented, among citizens due to the perception that they are less necessary than economic measures that have greater visible and short-term effects.",

For example, some politicians such as Donald Trump (US) or Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil) have argued that, in order to save the economy from the effects of the pandemic, imposing the measures to reduce face-to-face interactions should be avoided. However, the avoidance of these measures resulted in many fatalities (Brauner et al., 2021) . Also, current re-openings of economies, which can enhance spending and employment, can also cause a spread of the virus. Therefore, previous studies have looked at a trade-off between measures that are capable of containing the contagion and those that are capable of avoiding economic collapse (e.g. Fabbri et al., 2021) . Focusing on contagion, social protection and equity measures have been revealed to be important instruments against the pandemic combined with a strong health system (Alberti et al., 2020) .",

Focusing on the two main problems caused by the pandemic, we expected that citizens will prefer the adoption of short-term and less altruistic policies in those countries where COVID-19 has resulted in a worse economic situation. The economic situation in a country was evaluated using the variation of the unemployment rate, as job losses are the main consequence of the reduction in spending caused by COVID-19 (Chetty et al., 2020) . In turn, we expected that citizens will prefer the adoption of long-term altruistic policies in those countries where COVID-19 has J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f caused a diminished health situation. Total cases in a country are used to evaluate health problems that were caused by COVID-19, as the number of people that were infected may be a sign of a health emergency caused by a disease outbreak.

Persons with long-term orientation can assess grand societal challenges such as the COVID-19 crisis or environmental problems by giving more weight to future potential damage, as they have more of an \"an eye toward the future\" which considers distant outcomes of their current behaviors that allows them to act accordingly (Xu et al., 2015) .

In this situation, we expected that citizens with a higher environmental concern will show a stronger preference for altruistic policies, on account of their disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others. In addition, under identical circumstances, environmental concern serves to diminish the negative link between variations of the unemployment rate and a preference for long-term altruistic policies; furthermore, it reinforces a positive link between the total deaths caused by COVID-19 and a preference for long-term altruistic policies.

In particular, the sociodemographic characteristics of gender, age, education level, social class, and political ideology were included into the research model. Previous studies have uncovered that women tend to be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more concerned about quality of life (Belanche Gracia et al., 2015) and they show a stronger care ethic compared to men (Zelezny et al., 2000) . Therefore, we expected women to have a stronger preference for long-term altruistic policies. In terms of age, we expected a u-shape association with a preference for long-term altruistic policies, as younger people are typically more concerned about participating in new forms of engagement with social issues (Earl et al., 2017; Gifford & Nilsson, 2014) ; whereas older people may prefer more altruistic policies focused on health and social issues since fatality rate for disease like COVID-19 is greater as age increases. In addition, following Inglehart (1995) , when persons become more affluent, they become less worried about economic restrictions, and they pursue post-materialistic goals. Therefore, we expected a greater preference for long-term altruistic policies for individuals with higher education levels and those who belong to a higher social class. Finally, we also included political ideology, as left-wing attitudes strongly relate with altruism due to an overlap regarding concerns for social equality (Zettler & Hilbig, 2010) .",

First, population density: given that social distancing has become an approach to diminish virus infections since the start of the pandemic (e.g. Hantoko et al., 2021) , individuals that live in countries with higher population density may be more concerned about health-and social-oriented problems, prioritizing altruistic policies. Second, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita represents the current economic situation of a country; therefore, individuals from countries that are in a worse economic situation may be more likely to prioritize short-term policies to recover the economy. Third, countries differ in their cultural dimensions; that is: in their collective mental programming which distinguishes one group of people from another (Hofstede Insights, 2020) . In this respect, the individualism vs. collectivism cultural dimension J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Hofstede Insights, 2021) is crucial, as collectivistic cultures are tightly-knit societies in which individuals look after each other to a greater extent than non-collectivist cultures. Therefore, we expected people who are living in collectivistic countries will be more concerned about others and prefer altruistic policies. Given these factors, we summarize our research model in Figure 1 .",

Focusing on the full model, a negative association was uncovered between economic problems and the dependent variable, which is in accordance with Hypothesis 1.

Environmental concern is also positively associated with the dependent variable, which provides some support in favor of Hypothesis 3. Estimates' results are also in agreement with Hypotheses 4a and 4b, which show a significant and positive coefficient for the two interaction terms. In this sense, Figure 3 and Figure 4 graphically represent how environmental concern modifies the association between economic/health problems and our dependent variable. Particularly, it can be observed that as the level of environmental concern grows, the negative association between COVID-19's economic problems and citizens' preference for long-term altruistic policies fades. In the case of health problems, although to a lesser extent, as environmental J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f concern increases, the relationship between COVID-19 health problems' and long-term altruistic policy preferences becomes stronger. indicate that a preference for long-term altruistic policy measures is higher among females, among those with more left-wing political inclinations, and among respondents in more affluent classes. Moreover, a U-shaped association was discovered between the dependent variable and the age predictor. According to our estimation, the association decreases until around 44-45 years, and then it increases. In terms of country-level control variables, the results confirm that density population and GDP per capita are positively associated with a higher preference for long-term altruistic policies and, on the contrary, individualism is negatively associated with this variable.",

On the one hand, authorities intended to control the infection and to avoid health systems collapse through lockdowns, quarantines, and social life limitations which have caused serious negative economic consequences. On the other hand, it is also appreciable how national institutions have had various levels of tolerance in applying social restrictions and priorities to prevent economic failure that have undoubtedly been connected to the evolution in the number of contagions. Additionally, the resource capacity on the part of nations has been forced to prioritize between supporting social-and health-oriented policies and protecting the economic system. Therefore, an appropriate combination of both types of policies and their associated measures have been shown to be an important antecedent of the successful management of the pandemic (Allain-Dupr\u00e9, 2020; Haug et al., 2020) .",

In terms of public policy priorities, we showed that COVID-19-related health and economic problems' indicators are related with long-term altruistic priorities. These indicators affect an individual's understanding of the importance of every problem, and it assists in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f building individual priorities and a general opinion in this regard. As a result, total COVID-19 cases per million boosted the prevalence of long-term altruistic policy preferences, whereas a growth in unemployment rate levels boosted short-term and less altruistic preferences. Thus, populations that are affected by higher levels of COVID-19 infection shift their preferences towards a government strategy that is focused on protecting the long-term of the whole society (e.g., health and social welfare). By contrast, when economic problems come to the surface, citizens are more likely to prefer shortterm and less altruistic efforts (e.g. economic protection).",

            "text": "Responding to the question of whether environmental perceptions play a role in this policy trade-off, we have verified whether environmental concern affects long-term altruistic preferences construction in the specific case of COVID-19. We have confirmed that higher levels of individual environmental concern are related to preferences toward long-term altruistic policies. This result corroborates similar findings regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergency management of environmental problems (Hepburn et al., 2020; Klenert et al., 2020; Manzanedo & Manning, 2020) . Our results also are consistent with the idea that environmental concern is related to values that enable people to see beyond short-term and less altruistic issues such as economic ones (Escario et al., 2020; Meeusen, 2014) . Therefore, the negative relationship between environmental concern and self-interest (e.g. Stern et al., 1993) , traditionalism (e.g. Dietz et al., 2002) and/or materialism or egoism (e.g. Gatersleben et al., 2010) are in accordance with our results that explain why people concerned about environmental issues are more likely to prefer long-term altruistic policy measures. However, our findings not only detect a direct relationship, but also show how environmental concern moderates the associations between COVID-19-related problems and policy preferences. In particular, the presence of environmental concern softens (economic problems) and sharpens (health problems) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the associations with long-term altruistic policy preferences, respectively. Thus, our results confirms previous authors in line with the idea of that long-term vision is greatly detected in people with higher levels of environmental concern (Greitemeyer, 2013; Kortenkamp & Moore, 2006) . This perspective can assist people in interpreting problems and signals with an integral and long-term vision that is able to analyze the future consequences of COVID-19 policies. Thus, previous research has found that environmental concern is associated with greater long-term risk perceptions -for example, regarding health and environment connection (Subiza-P\u00e9rez et al., 2020)-, and that some of these risk perceptions, like heat-related health burdens, make people more oriented to health policies (Ban et al., 2019; Madrigano et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Finally, we observed that both individual-level and country-level characteristics, which act as control variables in our research model, are associated with citizens' preference for long-term altruistic policies. On the individual level, citizens with specific socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., females, young persons and elders, persons in a higher social-class, and persons with advanced degrees) exhibit a higher preference for long-term altruistic policies. As previous literature suggests (Belanche Gracia et al., 2015; Earl et al., 2017; Inglehart, 1995; Gifford & Nilsson, 2014; Zelezny et al., 2000) , sociodemographic characteristics are associated with certain values and goals (e.g., stronger care ethic, quality of life, engagement with social issues, post-materialistic thinking, etc.) that may explain this preference. These results allow us to determine the sociodemographic profiles of citizens with long-term altruistic vs. short-term non-altruistic policy preferences. Additionally, our results confirm that left-leaning individuals show a greater preference for long-term altruistic policies, as previous studies that drew attention to political ideology suggest (e.g. Margalit, 2013; Shaw and Shapiro 2005; Shapiro 2009; Zettler & Hilbig, 2010) . On the country level, the results indicate that not only stresses J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f caused by the virus in each country, but also the country's particular characteristics, are decisive in constructing policy preferences. In this way, similarly to what happens with the growth in the unemployment rate levels caused by COVID-19, a preference for shortterm non-altruistic policies is higher among citizens from countries with a lower GDP per capita (as they are in a worst economic situation in general). In addition, in those countries with a higher population density, which may make it more difficult to guarantee social distancing, the preference for altruistic policies is higher. Finally, our results are in line with the proposals of Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework (Hofstede Insights, 2020). Specifically, persons living in collectivistic countries, probably as a result of the values associated to these cultures (i.e., looking after each other to a greater extent), have a greater preference for long-term altruistic policies.",

In times of crisis, such as the one we are currently experiencing, people tend to behave more selfishly and they prioritize economic and health policies that have an immediate effect on their person, instead of pursuing more altruistic approaches that benefit society as a whole (Margalit, 2013) . Therefore, it has never been more important to make the response strategies to COVID-19 distinct from any economic recovery plans that have ever been seen before (UNEP, 2020) .

Thus, policymakers ought to discover ways of promoting an environmentally-sound and altruisticresponsible vision. Based on our findings, environmental concern can have an important role in this effort, since persons that are environmentally concerned have enough of a farsighted view to perceive future threats of COVID-19, which affects their preference towards social, environmental, and long-term altruistic-oriented policies over the shortterm non-altruistic counterparts. To increase citizens' environmental concern, policy administrators are benefited by developing public strategies that can consider the experiences and lessons learned during this crisis, since personal experience is the strongest predictor of environmental concern (Gifford and Nilsson, 2014) . For example, policy administrators can make use of scientific findings generated during this crisis that imply socially-responsible behavior (e.g., reducing private transportation, recycling, etc.) that have helped to improve the environment (Elsaid et al., 2021) . This approach would show that it is still possible to combat climate change and address the environmental emergency by putting into the spotlight of public debate the need to change behavior towards those integrating long-term vision of the problem. Furthermore, governments can be benefited by convincing citizens that environmental policies are aligned with economic growth, for example by focusing on key sustainable areas (e.g., deployment of renewable energy and energy-efficient industries) that yield substantial economic growth and millions of decent jobs (UNEP, 2020).",

This is especially important in supranational governments, such as the European Union, where a common response to the coronavirus pandemic is being coordinated. Thus, our results provide evidence that depending on the COVID-19-related public health and economic problems suffered in the country, citizens have a stronger preference towards one specific type of policy that moves away from a more integrated vision. Therefore, in those countries where COVID-19 has had a greater impact on their economies, the effort of governments towards a more altruistic and environmental citizen-oriented perspective ought to be greater. At this point, our study highlights, again, the importance of developing environmental campaigns since this type of campaigns can diminish the national vision that is focused only on economic aspects and can increase disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others (altruism). Furthermore, this study indicates that supranational governments should pay special attention to those countries with a lower GDP per capita and an individualistic culture when introducing environmental, health, and social policies. Thus, although the response to this crisis is carried out jointly in different countries, the way in which policies are introduced must differ in order to achieve greater acceptance by citizens. Finally, this study also assists policy-makers in determining the sociodemographic profiles of citizens with long-term altruistic policy preferences. This knowledge can be used by policy administrators to develop bettertailored public strategies to increase support for certain policies.",

            "text": "Despite the interesting results uncovered, this research has some limitations that suggest possibilities for further research. First, even though the survey used in this study provides nationally representative data from several European countries, the estimates rely on cross-sectional data to test a relationship between our independent variables (i.e., environmental concern, country-level and individual-level characteristics) and citizens' preference for long-term altruistic policies. As a result, the association tests cannot establish causal influences and additional research should go a step further by collecting longitudinal data. Second, we used several sources to construct our data set, but two key variables of our research (i.e., environmental concern and citizens' preference for longterm altruistic policies) were obtained from the Eurobarometer, for which the main purpose is not identical to the research goals of this study. The authors did not participate in the questionnaire development and we could not propose additional and more appropriate measurement scales, nor consider other variables than those provided. Third, due to the previous limitations, R 2 levels are quite low as it is usual when working with cross-sectional data. Including personality traits of the respondents could have been helpful to explain their policy preference, but we were limited to the information included in the survey. Fourth, this paper focuses on a specific pandemic, COVID-19, which has unique characteristics. Therefore, replications of the research model in future pandemics can produce different results depending on the characteristics of the pandemic (e.g., mortality). Finally, we have to take into account that our research draws attention to initial stages of the pandemic, where there was not any campaign of vaccination ongoing, there J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were still plenty of restrictions in movements, and the population had even suffered a lack of available health services in some hard moments. Analyzing how crucial achievements (e.g. vaccine authorization and availability, reducing travel restrictions, COVID vaccination passports, etc.) alter citizens' preferences may be of great interest too.",

            "text": "In general, this study contributes to understanding how a preference towards longterm altruistic policies ha been constructed during the COVID-19 crisis. This understanding is significant since successful responses to this crisis require more integrated approaches where long-term social, environmental, and health aspects also play a prominent role. Our results indicate that that a wide range of factors influence preferences for long-term altruistic policies. On the one hand, these preferences are explained by country-level characteristics such as COVID-19-related problems and intrinsic country variables (e.g., population density, GDP, and individualism vs collectivism). On the other hand, at the individual level, this study shows that citizens with some specific socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., females, younger persons and elders, persons in high social classes, and persons with advanced degrees) exhibit a higher preference for long-term altruistic policies. Therefore, governments ought to pay attention to these characteristics when introducing policies to mitigate COVID-19 effects and other related future policy efforts. Finally, the most important conclusion derived from this study is the importance of improving the design and implementation of institutional J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f measures that focus on incrementing levels of individual environmental concern. As can be seen from the results presented, environmental concern plays an important role as a facilitating lever for the successful introduction of long-term altruistic policies (e.g., socially-responsible and health-oriented). In this sense, it was discovered that environmental concern not only acts as a motivator for these policy preferences, but it can also help reduce the opposing vision of materialistic policies in instances where health and economic effects of the crisis have been high in the country. 1 Developing the financial means to find a treatment or vaccine +1 2 Ensure the management and coordination of a reserve of strategic medical devices that is common to all the Member States of the European Union +1 3 Ensure coordination between the Member States of the European Union on a financial level -1 4 Increase the budget of the European Union -1 5 Promote the transfer of industries to the European Union -1 6 Provide more financial support to the most affected regions of the European Union +1 7 Impose stricter control of the external borders of the European Union -1 8 Allow the Member States of the European Union to support their economy, for example through state aid 0 9 Establish a strategy to deal with a similar crisis in the future +1 10 Promote dialogue and solidarity among the Member States of the European Union +1 11 Review the principle of free movement between the Member States of the European Union -1 12 Developing a European health policy +1 13 Investing more money in the economy to achieve a sustainable, inclusive and equitable recovery in all Member States of the European Union +1 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",
